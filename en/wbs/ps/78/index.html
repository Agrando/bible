Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That the generation to come might know them, even the children who should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man ate angels' food: he sent them food to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they ate, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were not estranged from their desire: but while their meat was yet in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And smote all the first-born in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He gave over his people also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And he smote his enemies in the hinder part: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheep-folds:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
