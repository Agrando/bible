Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they afflicted like other men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore pride encompasseth them as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the day long have I been afflicted, and chastened every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I understood their end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou didst cast them down into destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast held me by my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go astray from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
