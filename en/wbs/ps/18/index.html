my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>\18:3\I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>\18:4\The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>\18:5\The sorrows of hell encompassed me: the snares of death seized me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>\18:6\In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>\18:7\Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>\18:8\There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>\18:9\He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>\18:10\And he rode upon a cherub, and flew; yes, he flew upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>\18:11\He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion around him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>\18:12\At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>\18:13\The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>\18:14\Yes, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>\18:15\Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>\18:16\He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>\18:17\He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them who hated me: for they were too strong for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>\18:18\They attacked me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>\18:19\He brought me forth also in a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>\18:20\The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>\18:21\For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>\18:22\For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>\18:23\I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>\18:24\Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>\18:25\With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful;

that I might destroy them that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>\18:41\They cried, but there was none to save them: even to the LORD, but he answered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>\18:42\Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>\18:43\Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>\18:44\As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>\18:45\The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid from their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>\18:46\The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>\18:47\It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>\18:48\He delivereth me from my enemies: yes, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>\18:49\Therefore will I give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises to thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>\18:50\He giveth great deliverance to his king; and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
