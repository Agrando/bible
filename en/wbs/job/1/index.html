Thus did Job continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for naught?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God hath fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And said, Naked came I from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
