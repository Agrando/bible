or with speeches with which he can do no good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yes, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thy mouth uttereth thy iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thy own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yes, thy own lips testify against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What knowest thou that we know not?
