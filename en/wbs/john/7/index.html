If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>(For neither did his brethren believe in him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go ye up to this feast: I go not yet to this feast, for my time is not yet full come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When he had said these words to them, he abode still in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brethren had gone up, then he went also to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceiveth the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet, no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man will do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God, or whether I speak from myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that speaketh from himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who goeth about to kill thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses therefore gave to you circumcision, (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we know this man, whence he is: whereas when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then cried Jesus in the temple, as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him: and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirsteth, let him come to me, and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>(But this he spoke of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, In truth this is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Will Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh from the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division among the people because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the Pharisees answered them, Are ye also deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this people who know not the law are cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus saith to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him, and knoweth what he doeth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, Art thou also from Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And every man went to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
