But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So when they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus had raised himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those thy accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest concerning thyself; thy testimony is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Though I testify concerning myself, yet my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye judge after the flesh, I judge no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am one that testifieth concerning myself; and the Father that sent me, testifieth concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jesus again to them, I am going away, and ye will seek me, and will die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said the Jews, will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said therefore to you, that ye will die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye will die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say, and to judge of you: but he that sent me, is true: and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They understood not that he spoke to them concerning the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said Jesus to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spoke these words, many believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Whoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that ye are Abraham's offspring; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He that is of God, heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never taste death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honoreth me, of whom ye say, that he is your God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then said the Jews to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then they took up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
