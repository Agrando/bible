I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is insane; why hear ye him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then came the Jews around him, and said to him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I did in my Father's name, they testify concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and my Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they sought again to take him; but he escaped from their hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And went again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many resorted to him, and said, John performed no miracle; but all things that John spoke of this man were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed on him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
