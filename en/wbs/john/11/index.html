If any man walketh in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if a man walketh in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things he said: and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepeth he will do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless, let us go to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs distant.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I know that even now, whatever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha saith to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die. Believest thou this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She saith to him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when she had so said, she went and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews then who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth to the grave to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him, Lord, by this time his body is offensive: for he hath been dead four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people who stand by, I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and said, What do we? for this man performeth many miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And this he spoke not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And not for that nation only, but that also he should assemble in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then they sought for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
