and she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thy hand: and he gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she arose and went her way and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, where is the harlot that was openly by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold she is with child by lewdness: and Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah acknowledged them, and said She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he knew her again no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass when she travailed, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And afterwards came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zarah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
