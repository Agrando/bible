Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should we steal from thy lord's house silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whom soever of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bond-men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, (for he was yet there:) and they fell before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother shall be with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I return to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
