Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban, with his brethren, pitched in the mount of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons, and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou didst earnestly long after thy father's house; yet why hast thou stolen my gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee: for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maid-servants' tents; but he found them not. Then he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob was wroth, and chid with Laban: and Jacob answered, and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so eagerly pursued after me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household-stuff? set it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>That which was torn by beasts, I brought not to thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thus I was; in the day the drouth consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Laban answered, and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have borne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they ate there upon the heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives besides my daughters; no man is with us; See, God is witness betwixt me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
