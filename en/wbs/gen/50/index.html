Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there went with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did to thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face: and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joseph said to his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
