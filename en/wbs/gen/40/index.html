And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph answered, and said, This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birth-day, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
