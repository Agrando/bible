and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, he turned from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
