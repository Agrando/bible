and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Cush, Behold, he hath come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Thelasar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>LORD, bow down thy ear, and hear: open, LORD, thy eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent him to reproach the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high: even against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down its tall cedar trees, and its choice fir trees: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have digged and drank strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities in ruinous heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house-tops, and as corn blasted before it is grown up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this shall be a sign to thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
