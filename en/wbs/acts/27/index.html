And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave him liberty to go to his friends to refresh himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when we had lanched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Mira, a city of Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce had come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And hardly passing it, came to a place which is called, The fair havens; nigh to which was the city of Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless, the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than the things which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is a haven of Crete, and lieth towards the south-west and north-west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And running under a certain isle which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of life among you, but of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Cesar: and lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it will be even as it was told to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But we must be cast upon a certain isle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen suspected that they drew near to some country:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would cast anchors out of the foreship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wherefore I pray you to take some food; for this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all; and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then they were all of good cheer, and they also took food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And we were in all in the ship two hundred and seventy six souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into which they purposed, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted the mainsail to the wind, and made towards the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained immovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that they who could swim, should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship: And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
