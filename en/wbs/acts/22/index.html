And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which are appointed for thee to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews who dwelt there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Came to me, and stood, and said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldst know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldst hear the voice of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thou shalt be his witness to all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, that when I had come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they gave him audience to this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a man from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know for what cause they cried so against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest; for this man is a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the chief captain came, and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the chief captain answered, With a great sum I obtained this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then forthwith they departed from him who were about to examine him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
