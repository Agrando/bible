And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These going before, tarried for us at Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And we sailed away from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them (ready to depart on the morrow) and continued his speech until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, having fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him, said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When he had come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and discoursed a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And we went before to a ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they had come to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have shown you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Save that the Holy Spirit testifieth in every city, saying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wherefore I call you to witness this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Also from your own selves will men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have shown you all things, that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all wept bitterly, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
