And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to dwell in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they took to themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left by her two sons and her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said to her, surely we will return with thee to thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? shall I bear more sons, that they may be your husbands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have a husband also to-night, and should also bear sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Would ye wait for them till they should be grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law hath gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death shall part thee and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When she saw that she was steadfastly resolved to go with her, then she left speaking to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley-harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
