and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As ye also learned from Epaphras our dear fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That ye may walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Giving thanks to the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his beloved Son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are upon earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all things he may have the pre-eminence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they are things on earth, or things in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you, that were formerly alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which hath been preached to every creature which is under heaven; of which I Paul am made a minister;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Of which I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For which I also labor, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
