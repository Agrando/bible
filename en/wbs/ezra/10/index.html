And they swore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he ate no bread, nor drank water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, and the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives to increase the trespass of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the foreign wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand abroad, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter shall be turned from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the children of the captivity did so.
