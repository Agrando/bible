For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou shalt not go forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse to thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king rose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he hath fled out of the land for Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: why then are ye the last to bring back the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word to the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there went over a ferry-boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he came over Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore behold, I have come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore the king said to Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride on it, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he hath slandered thy servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thy eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that ate at thy own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yes, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king hath come again in peace to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim: for he was a very great man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king said to Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Barzillai said to the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I am this day eighty years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing-men and singing-women? why then should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with such a reward?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Let thy servant, I pray thee, return again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to thee: and whatever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king had come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to him, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: why then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
