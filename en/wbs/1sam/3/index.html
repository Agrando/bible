And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to grow dim, that he could not see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have told him, that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD: and Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said to thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou shalt hide any thing from me, of all the things that he said to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
