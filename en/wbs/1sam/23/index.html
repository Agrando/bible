And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was told to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David knew that Saul secretly plotted mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then David and his men who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah: and he forbore to go forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou wilt be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know, and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told to me that he dealeth very subtilly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he is in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men around to take them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammah-lekoth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
