And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah; but the LORD had rendered her barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had made her barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived, after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, O my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshiped the LORD there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
