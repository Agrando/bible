And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines: and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed) then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt-offering to me, and peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled at Michmash;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore said I, the Philistines will now come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD; I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leadeth to Ophrah, to the land of Shual:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim towards the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: (for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his colter, and his ax, and his mattock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the colters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
