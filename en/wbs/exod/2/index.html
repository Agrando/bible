And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go, and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy fellow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon to day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry ascended to God, by reason of the bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect to them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
