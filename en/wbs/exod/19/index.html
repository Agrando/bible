These are the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And be ready against the third day: for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up upon the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through: whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And mount Sinai was altogether in a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount trembled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let the priests also who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD said to him, Away, go down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: But let not the priests and the people break through, to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
