I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works; go you to your burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the task-masters of the people, and their officers, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the number of the bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein: and let them not regard vain words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the task-masters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your work shall be diminished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble instead of straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the task-masters hastened them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's task-masters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thy own people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go, and do sacrifice to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks of your daily task.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said to them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to slay us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why hast thou so ill treated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
