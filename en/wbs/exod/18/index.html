Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses's father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hearken now to my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people toward God, that thou mayest bring the causes to God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge: So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
