the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall depart by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not depart free:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door-post: and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if a man shall sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not depart as the men-servants do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If she shall not please her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he hath betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he shall take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if he shall not perform these three to her, then shall she depart free without money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall be surely put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if a man shall not lie in wait, but God shall deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if a man shall come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he shall be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if men contend together, and one shall smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he shall not die, but keep his bed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If he shall rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if a man shall smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he shall die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Notwithstanding, if he shall continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If men shall contend, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit shall depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if any mischief shall follow, then thou shalt give life for life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if a man shall smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it shall perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if he shall smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If an ox shall gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But if the ox was accustomed to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not restrained him, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If there shall be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether he hath gored a son, or hath gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If the ox shall push a man-servant, or maid-servant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass shall fall into it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The owner of the pit shall make compensation, and give money to the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if one man's ox shall hurt another's that he shall die, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it, and the dead ox also they shall divide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or if it shall be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not restrained him; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his own.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
