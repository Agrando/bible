is not he that sitteth at table? but I am among you as he that serveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both into prison, and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, before thou wilt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and sack, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said he to them, But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his sack: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say to you, that this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he arose from prayer, and had come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And said to them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When they who were about him, saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, Are ye come out as against a thief, with swords and staffs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then they took him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And about the space of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying, In truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men that held Jesus, mocked him, and smote him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things blasphemously they spoke against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief priests, and the scribes came together, and led him into their council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Saying, Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Hereafter will the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What need have we of any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
