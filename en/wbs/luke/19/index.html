Thou knewest me to be an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Why then gavest thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(And they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For I say to you, That to every one who hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But those my enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending towards Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when he had come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in which at your entering ye will find a colt tied, on which yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if any man shall ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they that were sent, went and found even as he had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why loose ye the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when he had come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he answered and said to them, I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he had come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thy eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days shall come upon thee, that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and encompass thee, and keep thee in on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee: and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold in it, and them that bought,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
