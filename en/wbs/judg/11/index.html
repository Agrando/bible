And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab; but he would not consent. And Israel abode in Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou possess it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that are along by the borders of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then it shall be, that whatever cometh out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it for a burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he smote them from Aroer even till thou comest to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And she said to him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thy enemies, even of the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
