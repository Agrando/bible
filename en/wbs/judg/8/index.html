Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then, when he had said that, their anger towards him abated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me: for they are faint, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy army?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun had risen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described to him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, even seventy seven men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye upbraided me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men that are weary?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to Jether his first-born, Arise, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his prey. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and cast into it every man the ear-rings of his prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested, was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; besides ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Gideon made of it an ephod, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither astray after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they raised their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Gideon had seventy sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went astray after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
