And also to thy maid-servant thou shalt do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It shall not seem hard to thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been of double the worth of a hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if there is any blemish in it, as if it is lame, or blind, or hath any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it to the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only thou shalt not eat its blood; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
