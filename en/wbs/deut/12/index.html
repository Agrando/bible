and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye shall not do so to the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave-offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will-offerings, and the firstlings of your herds, and of your flocks:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand to, ye and your households, in which the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the LORD your God giveth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies on every side, so that ye dwell in safety:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow to the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates;

and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thou shalt not do so to the LORD thy God; for every abomination to the LORD which he hateth have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Whatever thing I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add to it, nor diminish from it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
