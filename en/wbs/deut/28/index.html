and they shall cleave to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also every sickness, and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou art destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldst not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to naught; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even to the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have no assurance of thy life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning thou shalt say, O that it were evening, and at evening thou shalt say, O that it were morning! for the fear of thy heart with which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thy eyes which thou shalt see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I have said to thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold to your enemies for bond-men and bond-women, and no man shall buy you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
