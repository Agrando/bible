I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They helped every one his neighbor; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said to thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yes, I will help thee; yes, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that contend with thee shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of naught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying to thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah-tree, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let them bring them forth, and show us what shall happen: let them show the former things, what they are that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare to us things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of naught: an abomination is he that chooseth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and before time, that we may say, He is righteous? verily, there is none that showeth, verily, there is none that declareth, verily, there is none that heareth your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counselor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, they are all vanity, their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
