Then said I, Here am I; send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities shall be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD shall have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance of it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
