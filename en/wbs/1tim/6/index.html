These things teach and exhort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any man teacheth otherwise, and consenteth not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, from which cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness: from such withdraw thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having food and raiment, with these let us be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some have coveted, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But thou, O man of God, flee from these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I give thee charge in the sight of God, who maketh alive all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified a good confession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Which in his times he will show who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Which some professing, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
