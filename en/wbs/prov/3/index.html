write them upon the table of thy heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust in the LORD with all thy heart; and lean not to thy own understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thy increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD;
