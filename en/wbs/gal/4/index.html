and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>However then, when ye knew not God, ye did service to them which by nature are no gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now, after ye have known God, or rather are known by God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which ye desire again to be in bondage?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye know that in infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then was the blessedness ye spoke of; for I bear you testimony, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously affect you, but not well; for, they would exclude you, that ye may affect them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who was of the bond-woman, was born according to the flesh; but he of the free-woman was by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she who hath a husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nevertheless, what saith the scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and her son: for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
