and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then will the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his feet will stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst of it towards the east and towards the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove towards the north, and half of it towards the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, ye shall flee as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening it shall be light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them towards the former sea, and half of them towards the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD will be king over all the earth: in that day will there be one LORD, and his name one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's wine-presses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen around shall be collected, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall be, that whoever will not come up of all the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, and shall not come, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, with which the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS TO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe in them: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
