there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; and nothing shall escape them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD will utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore also now, saith the LORD, Turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth of the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat-offering and a drink-offering to the LORD your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: why should they say among the people, Where is their God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD will answer and say to his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied with it; and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I will remove far from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea, and his odious scent shall come up, and his ill savor shall come up, because he hath done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
