Presumptuous are they, self-willed; they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day-time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: they have a heart exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who have forsaken the right way, and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice, forbad the madness of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that had quite escaped from them who live in error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for by whom a man is overcome, by the same is he brought into bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But it hath happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and, The sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
