(that is, to bring Christ down.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring Christ again from the dead.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with the heart man believeth to righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the scripture saith, whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all, is rich to all that call upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Did not Israel know? First, Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found by them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
