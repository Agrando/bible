For if through the offense of one many are dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That as sin hath reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
