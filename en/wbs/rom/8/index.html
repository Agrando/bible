Now if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised Christ from the dead will also revive your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit itself testifieth with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if we suffer with him, that we may be glorified together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we are saved by hope: But hope that is seen, is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we see not, then with patience we wait for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who will lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, or rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nor hight, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
