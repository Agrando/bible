Moreover, I will subdue all thy enemies. Furthermore, I tell thee that the LORD will build thee a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall come to pass, when thy days shall be ended that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And yet this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What can David speak more to thee for the honor of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore now, LORD, Let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness to thy servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
