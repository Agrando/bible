So I lifted up my eyes the way towards the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said furthermore to me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should withdraw from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said he to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping animals, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around upon the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he to me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said also to me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was towards the north; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said he to me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs towards the temple of the LORD, and their faces towards the east; and they worshiped the sun towards the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he said to me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and lo, they put the branch to their nose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore will I also deal in fury: my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
