Is this of thy lewdness a small matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all thy abominations and thy deeds of lewdness thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe to thee! saith the Lord GOD;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That thou hast also built to thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a high place in every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy lewd deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy lewd deeds, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thy ordinary food, and delivered thee to the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yes, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldst not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan to Chaldea; and yet with this thou wast not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious lewd woman;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that thou buildest thy eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy high place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But as a wife that committeth adultery, who taketh strangers instead of her husband!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They give gifts to all lewd women: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come to thee on every side for thy lewdness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy unlawful commerce, whereas none followeth thee to commit lewdness: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given to thee, therefore thou art contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness exposed through thy carnal connection with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold therefore, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them on every side against thee, and will uncover thy nakedness to them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So will I make my fury towards thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these things; behold therefore, I also will recompense thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thy abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thy abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thy abominations which thou hast done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Thou also, who hast judged thy sisters, bear thy own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yes, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>That thou mayest bear thy own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Before thy wickedness was disclosed, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise thee on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thy abominations, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish to thee an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger: and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
