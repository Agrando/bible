and lo, they were very dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? and I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he said to me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say to them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD to these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you out of your graves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sticks on which thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers have dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My tabernacle also shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
