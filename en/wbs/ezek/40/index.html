and he stood in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I might show them to thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold a wall on the outside of the house around, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and a hand-breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed: and the hight, one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he came to the gate which looketh towards the east, and ascended its stairs, and measured the threshhold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshhold of the gate, which was one reed broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshhold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits;

even to the post of the court around the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from the face of the gate of the entrance to the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate around, and likewise to the arches: and windows were around inward: and upon each post were palm-trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he brought me into the outward court, and lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court around: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court without, a hundred cubits eastward and northward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the gate of the outward court that looked towards the north, he measured its length, and its breadth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the little chambers of it were three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth five and twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And their windows, and their arches, and their palm-trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh towards the east;

and he measured the south gate according to these measures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, according to these measures; and there were windows in it and in its arches around: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the arches around were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And its arches were towards the outer court;

and palm-trees were upon its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the chambers and its entries were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay upon it the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, upon which they slew their sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt-offering, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high: upon which also they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And within were hooks, a hand broad, fastened around: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was towards the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect towards the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is towards the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the chamber whose prospect is towards the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who come near to the LORD to minister to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare;
