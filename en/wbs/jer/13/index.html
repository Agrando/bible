For the greatness of thy iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels made bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore will I uncover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neighings, the enormity of thy lewdness, and thy abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to thee O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
