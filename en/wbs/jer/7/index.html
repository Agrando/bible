Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But go ye now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore will I do to this house, which is called by my name, in which ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Since the day that your fathers came forth from the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet they hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore thou shalt speak all these words to them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call to them; but they will not answer thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But thou shalt say to them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth hath perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Cut off thy hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there shall be no place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
