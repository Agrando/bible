And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah, in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as it seemeth good and meet to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye will surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon its inhabitants: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then arose certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they brought forth Urijah from Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
