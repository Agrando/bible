The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was Thaddeus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and enter ye not into any city of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as ye go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons: freely ye have received, freely give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor bag for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor a staff: for the workman is worthy of his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And into whatever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till ye go thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when ye come into a house, salute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart from that house, or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Verily, I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But beware of men: for they will deliver you to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given to you in that same hour what ye shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children will rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye will be hated by all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say to you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man shall have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for the disciple that he should be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord: if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call them of his household?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that publish ye upon the house-tops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And fear not them who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Whoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And a man's foes will be they of his own household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth me, is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones, a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily, I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
