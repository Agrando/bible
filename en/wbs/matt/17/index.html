And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? from their own children, or from strangers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter saith to him, From strangers. Jesus saith to him, Then are the children free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take the fish that first cometh up: and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: take that, and give to them for me and thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
