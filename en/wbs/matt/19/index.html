Therefore what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He saith to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except for lewdness, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoever marrieth her who is put away, committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples say to him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are some eunuchs, who were so born from their mothers womb: and there are some eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then were brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He saith to him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept from my youth: what lack I yet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said Jesus to his disciples, Verily I say to you, that a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus beheld them, and said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then answered Peter, and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee? what shall we have therefore?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, that ye who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's sake, shall receive a hundred-fold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
