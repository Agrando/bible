Thus have ye made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then came his disciples, and said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be extirpated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leadeth the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then answered Peter and said to him, Declare to us this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do ye not yet understand, that whatever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the territories of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same territories, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously afflicted with a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then came she and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crums which fall from their master's table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh to the sea of Galilee; and ascended a mountain, and sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And great multitudes came to him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to satisfy so great a multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he commanded the multitude to sit on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all ate and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that were left seven baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he sent away the multitude, and took a boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
