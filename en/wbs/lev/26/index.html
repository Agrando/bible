and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid the land of evil beasts, neither shall the sword go through your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bond-men, and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye will not hearken to me, and will not do all these commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul shall abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also will do this to you, I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you, and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if ye will not yet for all this hearken to me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if ye shall walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, and your high-ways shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then will I also walk contrary to you, and I will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you: and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when I have broke the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if ye will not for all this hearken to me, but walk contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then I will walk contrary to you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lieth desolate, it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And upon them that are left alive of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall, when none pursueth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts shall be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And yet for all that, when they shall be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes, and judgments, and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
