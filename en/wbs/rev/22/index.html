And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then saith he to me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saith to me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and lewd men, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loveth and maketh a lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches.

And let him that is thirsty, come: And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I testify to every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
