But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace-offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer ascended to his holy dwelling-place, even to heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
