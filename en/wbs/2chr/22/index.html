So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counselors, after the death of his father, to his destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the destruction of Ahaziah was from God by coming to Joram: for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to retain the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose, and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bed chamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
