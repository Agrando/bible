and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, being warned by God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham, when he was called to remove into a place which he should afterwards receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out not knowing whither he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore there sprang even from one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea-shore innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came, they might have had opportunity to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only-begotten son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Accounting that God was able to raise him even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshiped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he had come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first-born should touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians essaying to do were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encompassed seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, as she had received the spies with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what shall I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah, of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, and, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
