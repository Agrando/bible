But Jesus answereth again, and saith to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus looking upon them, saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter began to say to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said, Verily I say to you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he shall receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they will mock him, and will scourge him, and will spit upon him, and will kill him: and the third day he will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of: and with the baptism that I am baptized with shalt ye be baptized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Jesus called them, and saith to them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But so it shall not be among you: but whoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whoever of you will be the chief, shall be servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For even the son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples, and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the highway-side begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called: and they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, What wilt thou that I should do to thee? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to him, Go, thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
