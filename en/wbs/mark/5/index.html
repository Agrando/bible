I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For he said to him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there was there nigh to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the demon, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they that saw it told them how it befell him that was possessed with the demon, and also concerning the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they began to pray him to depart out of their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had come into the boat, he that had been possessed with the demon prayed him that he might be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet Jesus suffered him not, but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him. And all men wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Jesus had passed over again in a boat to the other side, much people gathered to him: and he was nigh to the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus went with him; and many people followed him, and thronged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And a certain woman who had an issue of blood twelve years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And had suffered many things from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not relieved, but rather grew worse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the throng, and said, Who touched my clothes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he looked around, to see her that had done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be healed of thy infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While he was yet speaking, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain who said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when he had come in, he saith to them, Why make ye this tumult, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they derided him: but when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi: which is, being interpreted, Damsel (I say to thee) arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And forthwith the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he charged them strictly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
