As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up, taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles, else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn-fields on the sabbath; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he and they that were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How he went into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show-bread, which it is not lawful to eat, but for the priests, and gave also to them who were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
