What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I have received from the Lord, that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if any man hungereth, let him eat at home; that ye come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
