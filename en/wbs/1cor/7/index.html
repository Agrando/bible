But every man hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if she shall depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But to the rest I speak, not the Lord, if any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman who hath a husband that believeth not, and if he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases; but God hath called us to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not become circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let every man continue in the same calling in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Art thou called being a servant? care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's free-man: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brethren, let every man in the state in which he is called, continue in it with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if thou marry, thou hast not sinned: and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless, such will have trouble in the flesh; but I spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brethren, The time is short. It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they that use this world, as not abusing it. For the fashion of this world passeth away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I would have you without anxious care. He that is unmarried, is anxious for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he that is married, is anxious for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy, both in body and in spirit: but she that is married, is anxious for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself uncomely towards his virgin, if she hath passed the flower of her age, and need so requireth, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nevertheless, he that standeth steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband is dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier if she so remain, after my judgment; and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
