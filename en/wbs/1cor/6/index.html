Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that will be able to judge between his brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for lewdness, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know ye not, that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of a harlot? By no means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What? know ye not that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee lewdness. Every sin that a man doeth, is without the body; but he that committeth lewdness, sinneth against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What, know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God, and ye are not your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
