But let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if any man buildeth upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Every man's work will be made manifest: for the day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will try every man's work, of what sort it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man's work abideth which he hath built upon it, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man's work shall be burned, he will suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man defileth the temple of God, him will God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no man glory in men: for all things are yours:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
