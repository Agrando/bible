and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is thine; the heave-offering of their gift, with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether of men or beast, shall be thine: nevertheless, the first born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thy estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right shoulder are thine</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given to thee, and to thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to thee and to thy seed with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this your heave-offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the wine-press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering to the LORD of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them the LORD'S heave-offering to Aaron the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of the LORD, of all the best of it, even its hallowed part out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore thou shalt say to them, When ye have heaved from it the best of it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
