and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And put fire in them, and put incense in them before the LORD to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Seemeth it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For which cause both thou and all thy company are assembled against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: who said, We will not come up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also and Aaron each of you his censer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on them, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Speak to the congregation, saying, Withdraw yourselves from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses rose up, and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they withdrew from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses said, by this ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works: for I have not done them of my own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If these men shall die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if the LORD shall make a new thing, and the earth shall open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground cleaved asunder that was under them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They, and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And all Israel that were round about them, fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he may not be as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked towards the tabernacle of the congregation: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Remove from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
