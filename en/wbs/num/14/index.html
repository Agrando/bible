were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the LORD delighteth in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense has departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But all the congregation required to stone them with stones: and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shown among them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians will hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day-time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt, even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because all those men who have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(Now the Amalekites, and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
