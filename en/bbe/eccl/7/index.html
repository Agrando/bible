Such a question comes not from wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wisdom together with a heritage is good, and a profit to those who see the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wisdom keeps a man from danger even as money does; but the value of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to its owner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Give thought to the work of God. Who will make straight what he has made bent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the day of wealth have joy, but in the day of evil take thought: God has put the one against the other, so that man may not be certain what will be after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>These two have I seen in my life which is to no purpose: a good man coming to his end in his righteousness, and an evil man whose days are long in his evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not given overmuch to righteousness and be not over-wise. Why let destruction come on you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be not evil overmuch, and be not foolish. Why come to your end before your time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good to take this in your hand and not to keep your hand from that; he who has the fear of God will be free of the two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wisdom makes a wise man stronger than ten rulers in a town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There is no man on earth of such righteousness that he does good and is free from sin all his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not give ear to all the words which men say, for fear of hearing the curses of your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your heart has knowledge how frequently others have been cursed by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All this I have put to the test by wisdom; I said, I will be wise, but it was far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Far off is true existence, and very deep; who may have knowledge of it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I gave my mind to knowledge and to searching for wisdom and the reason of things, and to the discovery that sin is foolish, and that to be foolish is to be without one's senses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I saw a thing more bitter than death, even the woman whose heart is full of tricks and nets, and whose hands are as bands. He with whom God is pleased will get free from her, but the sinner will be taken by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Look! this I have seen, said the Preacher, taking one thing after another to get the true account,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which my soul is still searching, but I have it not; one man among a thousand have I seen; but a woman among all these I have not seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This only have I seen, that God made men upright, but they have been searching out all sorts of inventions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
