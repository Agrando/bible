I had great wealth of herds and flocks, more than all who were in Jerusalem before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I got together silver and gold and the wealth of kings and of countries. I got makers of song, male and female; and the delights of the sons of men--girls of all sorts to be my brides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I became great; increasing more than all who had been before me in Jerusalem, and my wisdom was still with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And nothing which was desired by my eyes did I keep from them; I did not keep any joy from my heart, because my heart took pleasure in all my work, and this was my reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw all the works which my hands had made, and everything I had been working to do; and I saw that all was to no purpose and desire for wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I went again in search of wisdom and of foolish ways. What may the man do who comes after the king? The thing which he has done before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw that wisdom is better than foolish ways--as the light is better than the dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the foolish man goes walking in the dark; but still I saw that the same event comes to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said I in my heart: As it comes to the foolish man, so will it come to me; so why have I been wise overmuch? Then I said in my heart: This again is to no purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Of the wise man, as of the foolish man, there is no memory for ever, seeing that those who now are will have gone from memory in the days to come. See how death comes to the wise as to the foolish!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So I was hating life, because everything under the sun was evil to me: all is to no purpose and desire for wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hate had I for all my work which I had done, because the man who comes after me will have its fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who is to say if that man will be wise or foolish? But he will have power over all my work which I have done and in which I have been wise under the sun. This again is to no purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So my mind was turned to grief for all the trouble I had taken and all my wisdom under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because there is a man whose work has been done with wisdom, with knowledge, and with an expert hand; but one who has done nothing for it will have it for his heritage. This again is to no purpose and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What does a man get for all his work, and for the weight of care with which he has done his work under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All his days are sorrow, and his work is full of grief. Even in the night his heart has no rest. This again is to no purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is nothing better for a man than taking meat and drink, and having delight in his work. This again I saw was from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who may take food or have pleasure without him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To the man with whom he is pleased, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner he gives the work of getting goods together and storing up wealth, to give to him in whom God has pleasure. This again is to no purpose and desire for wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
