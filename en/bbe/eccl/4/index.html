This again is to no purpose and a desire for wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The foolish man, folding his hands, takes the flesh of his body for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>One hand full of rest is better than two hands full of trouble and desire for wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I came back, and I saw an example of what is to no purpose under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It is one who is by himself, without a second, and without son or brother; but there is no end to all his work, and he has never enough of wealth. For whom, then, am I working and keeping myself from pleasure? This again is to no purpose, and a bitter work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if one has a fall, the other will give him a hand; but unhappy is the man who is by himself, because he has no helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So again, if two are sleeping together they are warm, but how may one be warm by himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And two attacked by one would be safe, and three cords twisted together are not quickly broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A young man who is poor and wise is better than a king who is old and foolish and will not be guided by the wisdom of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because out of a prison the young man comes to be king, though by birth he was only a poor man in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I saw all the living under the sun round the young man who was to be ruler in place of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There was no end of all the people, of all those whose head he was, but they who come later will have no delight in him. This again is to no purpose and desire for wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>\5:1\Put your feet down with care when you go to the house of God, for it is better to give ear than to make the burned offerings of the foolish, whose knowledge is only of doing evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
