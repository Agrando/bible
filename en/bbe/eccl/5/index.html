And say not before the angel, It was an error. So that God may not be angry with your words and put an end to the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>\5:7\Because much talk comes from dreams and things of no purpose. But let the fear of God be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>\5:8\If you see the poor under a cruel yoke, and law and right being violently overturned in a country, be not surprised, because one authority is keeping watch on another and there are higher than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>\5:9\It is good generally for a country where the land is worked to have a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>\5:10\He who has a love for silver never has enough silver, or he who has love for wealth, enough profit. This again is to no purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>\5:11\When goods are increased, the number of those who take of them is increased; and what profit has the owner but to see them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>\5:12\The sleep of a working man is sweet, if he has little food or much; but to him who is full, sleep will not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>\5:13\There is a great evil which I have seen under the sun--wealth kept by the owner to be his downfall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>\5:14\And I saw the destruction of his wealth by an evil chance; and when he became the father of a son he had nothing in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>\5:15\As he came from his mother at birth, so does he go again; he gets from his work no reward which he may take away in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>\5:16\And this again is a great evil, that in all points as he came so will he go; and what profit has he in working for the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>\5:17\All his days are in the dark, and he has much sorrow, pain, disease, and trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>\5:18\This is what I have seen: it is good and fair for a man to take meat and drink and to have joy in all his work under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; that is his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>\5:19\Every man to whom God has given money and wealth and the power to have pleasure in it and to do his part and have joy in his work: this is given by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>\5:20\He will not give much thought to the days of his life; because God lets him be taken up with the joy of his heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
