It has been in the old time which was before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is no memory of those who have gone before, and of those who come after there will be no memory for those who are still to come after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I gave my heart to searching out in wisdom all things which are done under heaven: it is a hard thing which God has put on the sons of men to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have seen all the works which are done under the sun; all is to no purpose, and desire for wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That which is bent may not be made straight, and that which is not there may not be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I said to my heart, See, I have become great and am increased in wisdom more than any who were before me in Jerusalem--yes, my heart has seen much wisdom and knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I gave my heart to getting knowledge of wisdom, and of the ways of the foolish. And I saw that this again was desire for wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because in much wisdom is much grief, and increase of knowledge is increase of sorrow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
