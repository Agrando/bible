I make an outcry to you about violent behaviour, but you do not send salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Why do you make me see evil-doing, and why are my eyes fixed on wrong? for wasting and violent acts are before me: and there is fighting and bitter argument.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For this reason the law is feeble and decisions are not effected: for the upright man is circled round by evil-doers; because of which right is twisted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>See among the nations, and take note, and be full of wonder: for in your days I am doing a work in which you will have no belief, even if news of it is given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For see, I am sending the Chaldaeans, that bitter and quick-moving nation; who go through the wide spaces of the earth to get for themselves living-places which are not theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are greatly to be feared: their right comes from themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And their horses are quicker than leopards and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves; they come from far away, like an eagle in flight rushing on its food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They are coming all of them with force; the direction of their faces is forward, the number of their prisoners is like the sands of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He makes little of kings, rulers are a sport to him; all the strong places are to be laughed at; for he makes earthworks and takes them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then his purpose will be changed, over-stepping the limit; he will make his strength his god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you not eternal, O Lord my God, my Holy One? for you there is no death. O Lord, he has been ordered by you for our punishment; and by you, O Rock, he has been marked out to put us right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Before your holy eyes sin may not be seen, and you are unable to put up with wrong; why, then, are your eyes on the false? why do you say nothing when the evil-doer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He has made men like the fishes of the sea, like the worms which have no ruler over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He takes them all up with his hook, he takes them in his net, getting them together in his fishing-net: for which cause he is glad and full of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this reason he makes an offering to his net, burning perfume to his fishing-net; because by them he gets much food and his meat is fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this cause his net is ever open, and there is no end to his destruction of the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
