Selah. The heavens were covered with his glory, and the earth was full of his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He was shining like the light; he had rays coming out from his hand: there his power was kept secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Before him went disease, and flames went out at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From his high place he sent shaking on the earth; he saw and nations were suddenly moved: and the eternal mountains were broken, the unchanging hills were bent down; his ways are eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The curtains of Cushan were troubled, and the tents of Midian were shaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Was your wrath burning against the rivers? were you angry with the sea, that you went on your horses, on your war-carriages of salvation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Your bow was quite uncovered. Selah. By you the earth was cut through with rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The mountains saw you and were moved with fear; the clouds were streaming with water: the voice of the deep was sounding; the sun did not come up, and the moon kept still in her place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>At the light of your arrows they went away, at the shining of your polished spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You went stepping through the land in wrath, crushing the nations in your passion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You went out for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of the one on whom your holy oil was put; wounding the head of the family of the evil-doer, uncovering the base even to the neck. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You have put your spears through his head, his horsemen were sent in flight like dry stems; they had joy in driving away the poor, in making a meal of them secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The feet of your horses were on the sea, on the mass of great waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hearing it, my inner parts were moved, and my lips were shaking at the sound; my bones became feeble, and my steps were uncertain under me: I gave sounds of grief in the day of trouble, when his forces came up against the people in bands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For though the fig-tree has no flowers, and there is no fruit on the vine, and work on the olive comes to nothing, and the fields give no food; and the flock is cut off from its resting-place, and there is no herd in the cattle-house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Still, I will be glad in the Lord, my joy will be in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord God is my strength, and he makes my feet like roes' feet, guiding me on my high places.
