when it becomes clear to him, he will be responsible for any of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And whoever is responsible for any such sin, let him make a statement openly of his wrongdoing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And take to the Lord the offering for the wrong which he has done, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering, and the priest will take away his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if he has not money enough for a lamb, then let him give, for his offering to the Lord, two doves or two young pigeons; one for a sin-offering and one for a burned offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And let him take them to the priest, who will first give the sin-offering, twisting off its head from its neck, but not cutting it in two;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he is to put drops of the blood of the offering on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood is to be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the second is for a burned offering, in agreement with the law; and the priest will take away his sin and he will have forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if he has not enough money for two doves or two young pigeons, then let him give, for the sin he has done, the tenth part of an ephah of the best meal, for a sin-offering; let him put no oil on it, and no perfume, for it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And let him come to the priest with it, and the priest will take some of it in his hand, to be burned on the altar as a sign, among the offerings of the Lord made by fire: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest will take away his sin and he will have forgiveness: and the rest of the offering will be the priest's, in the same way as the meal offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If anyone is untrue, sinning in error in connection with the holy things of the Lord, let him take his offering to the Lord, a male sheep from the flock, without any mark, of the value fixed by you in silver by shekels, by the scale of the holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he is to make payment to the priest for what he has done wrong in relation to the holy thing, together with a fifth part of its value in addition; and the priest will take away his sin by the sheep of his offering, and he will have forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if anyone does wrong, and does any of the things which the Lord has given orders are not to be done, though he has no knowledge of it, still he is in the wrong and he is responsible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let him come to the priest with a sheep, a male without any mark out of the flock, of the value fixed by you, as an offering for his error; and the priest will take away the sin which he did in error, and he will have forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is an offering for his error: he is certainly responsible before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>\6:1\And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>\6:2\If anyone does wrong, and is untrue to the Lord, acting falsely to his neighbour in connection with something put in his care, or something given for a debt, or has taken away anything by force, or has been cruel to his neighbour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>\6:3\Or has taken a false oath about the loss of something which he has come across by chance; if a man has done any of these evil things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>\6:4\Causing sin to come on him, then he will have to give back the thing he took by force or got by cruel acts, or the goods which were put in his care or the thing he came on by chance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>\6:5\Or anything about which he took a false oath; he will have to give it all back, with the addition of a fifth of its value, to him whose property it is, when he has been judged to be in the wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>\6:6\Then let him take to the Lord the offering for his wrongdoing; giving to the priest for his offering, a male sheep from the flock, without any mark, of the value fixed by you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>\6:7\And the priest will take away his sin from before the Lord, and he will have forgiveness for whatever crime he has done</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
