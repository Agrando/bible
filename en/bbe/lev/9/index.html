and a meal offering mixed with oil: for this day you are to see the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they took the things ordered by Moses, before the Tent of meeting, and all the people came near, waiting before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said, This is what the Lord has said you are to do; and you will see the glory of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and make your sin-offering and your burned offering to take away your sin and the sin of the people, and make the people's offering to take away their sin; as the Lord has given orders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Aaron came near to the altar and put to death the ox for the sin-offering for himself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Aaron gave him the blood and he put his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, draining out the blood at the base of the altar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the fat and the kidneys and the fat on the liver of the sin-offering were burned by him on the altar as the Lord gave orders to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the flesh and the skin were burned with fire outside the tent-circle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he put to death the burned offering;

and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burned offering, and the peace-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of meeting, and came out and gave the people a blessing, and the glory of the Lord was seen by all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And fire came out from before the Lord, burning up the offering on the altar and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they gave a loud cry, falling down on their faces.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
