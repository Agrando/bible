and if, in his opinion, the place on his skin has not become worse and is not increased in size, then the priest will keep him shut up for seven days more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest is to see him again on the seventh day; and if the mark is less bright and is not increased on his skin, then let the priest say that he is clean: it is only a skin-mark, and after his clothing has been washed he will be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the size of the mark on his skin is increased after he has been seen by the priest, let him go to the priest again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if, after looking at him, he sees that the mark is increased in his skin, let the priest say that he is unclean; he is a leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the disease of a leper is seen on a man, let him be taken to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if the priest sees that there is a white growth on the skin, and the hair is turned white, and there is diseased flesh in the growth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is an old disease in the skin of his flesh, and the priest will say that he is unclean; he will not have to be shut up, for he is clearly unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if the disease comes out all over his skin, from his head to his feet, as far as the priest is able to see,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if the priest sees that all his flesh is covered with the leper's disease, the priest will say that he is clean: it is all turned white, he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But whenever diseased flesh is seen on him, he will be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the priest sees the diseased flesh he will say that he is unclean; the diseased flesh is unclean, he is a leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or if the diseased flesh is turned again and changed to white then he is to come to the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the priest will see him: and if the place is turned white, then the priest will say that he is free from the disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if a bad place has come out on the skin and is well again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And on the same place there is a white growth of a bright mark, red and white, then let the priest see it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after looking at it, if it seems to go deeper than the skin, and the hair on it is turned white, then the priest will say that the man is unclean: it is the leper's disease, it has come out in the bad place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if, after looking at it, he sees that there are no white hairs on it, and it is not deeper than the skin, and it is not very bright, then let the priest keep him shut up for seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if it is increasing on the skin, the priest will say that he is unclean: it is a disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if the bright mark keeps in the same place and gets no greater, it is the mark of the old wound, and the priest will say that he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Or if there is a burn on the skin of the flesh, and if the diseased flesh in the burn becomes a bright place, red and white or white,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The priest is to see it: and if the hair on the bright place is turned white and it seems to go deeper than the skin, he is a leper: it has come out in the burn, and the priest will say that he is unclean: it is the leper's disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if, after looking at it, the priest sees that there is no white hair on the bright place, and it is not deeper than the skin, and is not very bright, then let the priest keep him shut up for seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the priest is to see him again on the seventh day; if it is increased in the skin, then the priest will say that he is unclean: it is the leper's disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if the bright place keeps the same size and gets no greater on the skin, but is less bright, it is the effect of the burn, and the priest will say that he is clean: it is the mark of the burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when a man or a woman has a disease on the head, or in the hair of the chin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the priest is to see the diseased place: and if it seems to go deeper than the skin, and if there is thin yellow hair in it, then the priest will say that he is unclean: he has the mark of the leper's disease on his head or in the hair of his chin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after looking at the diseased place, if it does not seem to go deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest will have him shut up for seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And on the seventh day the priest will see the place: and if it is not increased, and there is no yellow hair in it, and it does not seem to go deeper than the skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then his hair is to be cut off, but not on the diseased place, and he is to be shut up for seven days more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And on the seventh day the priest will see the place: and if it is not increased, and does not seem to go deeper than the skin, the priest will say that he is clean: and after his clothing has been washed he will be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if the disease in his skin becomes worse after he has been made clean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the priest is to see him: and if the mark is increased, the priest, without looking for the yellow hair, will say that he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if, in his opinion, the growth is stopped, and black hair has come up on it, the disease has gone; he is clean and the priest will say that he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if a man or a woman has bright marks on the skin of their flesh, that is, bright white marks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then the priest is to see them: and if the white marks on their skin are not very bright, it is a skin disease which has come out on the skin; he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if a man's hair has come out and he has no hair, still he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if the hair has gone from the front part of his head, so that he has no hair there, still he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But if, on his head or on his brow, where he has no hair, there is a red and white place, it is the disease of the leper coming out on his head or on his brow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then if the priest sees that the growth of the disease has become red and white on his head or on his brow where there is no hair, like the mark in the skin of a leper;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He is a leper and unclean; the priest is to say that he is most certainly unclean: the disease is in his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the leper who has the disease on him is to go about with signs of grief, with his hair loose and his mouth covered, crying, Unclean, unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While the disease is on him, he will be unclean. He is unclean: let him keep by himself, living outside the tent-circle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And any clothing of wool or of linen in which is the mark of the disease;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If it is in the threads of the linen or of the wool, or in leather, or in anything made of skin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>If there are red or green marks on the clothing, or on the leather, or in the threads of the cloth, or in anything made of skin, it is the leper's disease: let the priest see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And after it has been seen by the priest, the thing which is so marked is to be shut up for seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he is to see the mark on the seventh day; if the mark is increased in the clothing, or in the threads of the material, or in the leather, whatever the leather is used for, it is the disease biting into it: it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the clothing, or the wool or linen material, or anything of leather in which is the disease, is to be burned: for the disease is biting into it; let it be burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And if the priest sees that the mark is not increased in the clothing or in any part of the material or in the leather,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then the priest will give orders for the thing on which the mark is, to be washed, and to be shut up for seven days more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And if, after the mark has been washed, the priest sees that the colour of it is not changed and it is not increased, it is to be burned in the fire: the disease is working in it, though the damage may be inside or outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And if the priest sees that the mark is less bright after the washing, then let him have it cut out of the clothing or the leather or from the threads of the material:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And if the mark is still seen in the clothing or in the threads of the material or in the leather, it is the disease coming out: the thing in which the disease is will have to be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And the material of the clothing, or anything of skin, which has been washed, if the mark has gone out of it, let it be washed a second time and it will be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This is the law about the leper's disease in the thread of wool or linen material, in clothing or in anything of skin, saying how it is to be judged clean or unclean.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
