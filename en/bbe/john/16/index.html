I did not say them to you at the first, because then I was still with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I am going to him who sent me; and not one of you says to me, Where are you going?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But your hearts are full of sorrow because I have said these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But what I am saying is true: my going is for your good: for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he, when he comes, will make the world conscious of sin, and of righteousness, and of being judged:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Of sin, because they have not faith in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Of righteousness, because I go to the Father and you will see me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Of being judged, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have still much to say to you, but you are not strong enough for it now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, when he, the Spirit of true knowledge, has come, he will be your guide into all true knowledge: for his words will not come from himself, but whatever has come to his hearing, that he will say: and he will make clear to you the things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will give me glory, because he will take of what is mine, and make it clear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everything which the Father has is mine: that is why I say, He will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After a little time you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So some of the disciples said one to another, What is this he is saying, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me? and, I am going to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So they said again and again, What is this he is saying, A little time? His words are not clear to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him, so he said to them, Is this what you are questioning one with another, why I said, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly I say to you, You will be weeping and sorrowing, but the world will be glad: you will be sad, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she has given birth to the child, the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So you have sorrow now: but I will see you again, and your hearts will be glad, and no one will take away your joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And on that day you will put no questions to me. Truly I say to you, Whatever request you make to the Father, he will give it to you in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Up to now you have made no request in my name: do so, and it will be answered, so that your hearts may be full of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>All this I have said to you in veiled language: but the time is coming when I will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the Father clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you will make requests in my name: and I do not say that I will make prayer to the Father for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Father himself gives his love to you, because you have given your love to me and have had faith that I came from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came out from the Father and have come into the world: again, I go away from the world and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said, Now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you: through this we have faith that you came from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus made answer, Have you faith now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>See, a time is coming, yes, it is now here, when you will go away in all directions, every man to his house, and I will be by myself: but I am not by myself, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble: but take heart! I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
