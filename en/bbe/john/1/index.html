Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And his answer was, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they said to him, Who are you then? We have to give some answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the waste land, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Those who had been sent came from the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they put this question to him, saying, Why then are you giving baptism if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John's answer was: I give baptism with water; but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is he who is coming after me; I am not good enough to undo his shoes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things took place at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was giving baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The day after, John sees Jesus coming to him and says, See, here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, One is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I myself had no knowledge of him, but I came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John gave this witness, saying, I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I had no knowledge who he was, but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting, it is he who gives baptism with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>This I saw myself and my witness is that he is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The day after, John was there again with two of his disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And looking at Jesus while he was walking he said, See, there is the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Hearing what he said, the two disciples went after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jesus, turning round, saw them coming after him and said to them, What are you looking for? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, Master), where are you living?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>+</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He said to them, Come and see. They went with him then and saw where he was living; and they were with him all that day: it was then about the tenth hour of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two men who, hearing what John said, went after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him, We have made discovery! It is the Messiah! (which is to say, the Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he took him to Jesus. Looking at him fixedly Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; your name will be Cephas (which is to say, Peter).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The day after this, Jesus had a desire to go into Galilee. He came across Philip and said to him, Come and be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now Philip's town was Beth-saida, where Andrew and Peter came from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Philip came across Nathanael and said to him, We have made a discovery! It is he of whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets were writing, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Nazareth! said Nathanael, Is it possible for any good to come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, See, here is a true son of Israel in whom there is nothing false.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael said to him, Where did you get knowledge of me? In answer Jesus said, Before Philip was talking with you, while you were still under the fig-tree, I saw you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nathanael said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>In answer Jesus said to him, You have faith because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree. You will see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said to him, Truly I say to you all, You will see heaven opening and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
