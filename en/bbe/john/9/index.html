So he went away and, after washing, came back able to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the neighbours and others who had seen him before in the street, with his hand out for money, said, Is not this the man who got money from people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they said to him, How then were your eyes made open?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His answer was: The man who is named Jesus put earth mixed with water on my eyes, and said to me, Go and make yourself clean in Siloam: so I went away and, after washing, am now able to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said to him, Where is he? His answer was: I have no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They took him before the Pharisees--this man who had been blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the day on which the earth was mixed by Jesus and the man's eyes were made open was the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the Pharisees put more questions to him about how his eyes had been made open. And he said to them, He put earth on my eyes, and I had a wash and am able to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then some of the Pharisees said, That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How is it possible for a sinner to do such signs? So there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Again they said to the blind man, What have you to say about him for opening your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the Jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see, till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And put the question to them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was blind at birth? how is it then that he is now able to see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In answer his father and mother said, We are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But how it is he is now able to see, or who made his eyes open, we are not able to say: put the question to him; he is old enough to give an answer for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said this because of their fear of the Jews: for the Jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that Jesus was the Christ he would be put out of the Synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That was the reason why they said, He is old enough; put the question to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him, Give glory to God: it is clear to us that this man is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said in answer, I have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not, but one thing I am certain about; I was blind, and now I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they said to him, What did he do to you? how did he give you the use of your eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>His answer was: I have said it before, but your ears were shut: why would you have me say it again? is it your desire to become his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they were angry with him and said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We are certain that God gave his word to Moses: but as for this man, we have no knowledge where he comes from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man said in answer, Why, here is a strange thing! You have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We have knowledge that God does not give ear to sinners, but if any man is a worshipper of God and does his pleasure, to him God's ears are open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man did not come from God he would be unable to do anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Their answer was: You came to birth through sin; do you make yourself our teacher? And they put him out of the Synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It came to the ears of Jesus that they had put him out, and meeting him he said, Have you faith in the Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said in answer, And who is he, Lord? Say, so that I may have faith in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, You have seen him; it is he who is talking to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, Lord, I have faith. And he gave him worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, I came into this world to be a judge, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>These words came to the ears of the Pharisees who were with him and they said to him, Are we, then, blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would have no sin: but now that you say, We see; your sin is there still.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
