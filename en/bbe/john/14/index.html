He who has seen me has seen the Father. Why do you say, Let us see the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have you not faith that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words which I say to you, I say not from myself: but the Father who is in me all the time does his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Have faith that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me: at least, have faith in me because of what I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly I say to you, He who puts his faith in me will do the very works which I do, and he will do greater things than these, because I am going to my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatever request you make in my name, that I will do, so that the Father may have glory in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you make any request to me in my name, I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If you have love for me, you will keep my laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will make prayer to the Father and he will give you another Helper to be with you for ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even the Spirit of true knowledge. That Spirit the world is not able to take to its heart because it sees him not and has no knowledge of him: but you have knowledge of him, because he is ever with you and will be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not let you be without a friend: I am coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A little time longer, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me; and you will be living because I am living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that time it will be clear to you that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who has my laws and keeps them, he it is who has love for me: and he who has love for me will be loved by my Father, and I will have love for him and will let myself be seen clearly by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, How is it that you will let yourself be seen clearly by us and not by the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to him in answer, If anyone has love for me, he will keep my words: and he will be dear to my Father; and we will come to him and make our living-place with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who has no love for me does not keep my words; and the word which you are hearing is not my word but the Father's who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have said all this to you while I am still with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will be your teacher in all things and will put you in mind of everything I have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>May peace be with you; my peace I give to you: I give it not as the world gives. Let not your heart be troubled; let it be without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Keep in mind how I said to you, I go away and come to you again. If you had love for me you would be glad, because I am going to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now I have given you word of it before it comes, so that, when it comes, you may have faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>After this I will not say much to you, because the ruler of this world comes: and he has no power over me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he comes so that the world may see that I have love for the Father, and that I am doing as I am ordered by the Father. Get up, and let us go.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
