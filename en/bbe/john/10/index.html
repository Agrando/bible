I have power to give it up, and I have power to take it again. These orders I have from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a division again among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And a number of them said, He has an evil spirit and is out of his mind; why do you give ear to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not the words of one who has an evil spirit. Is it possible for an evil spirit to make blind people see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came the feast of the opening of the Temple in Jerusalem: it was winter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus was walking in the Temple, in Solomon's covered way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Jews came round him, saying, how long are you going to keep us in doubt? If you are the Christ, say so clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said in answer, I have said it and you have no belief: the works which I do in my Father's name, these give witness about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you have no belief because you are not of my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep give ear to my voice, and I have knowledge of them, and they come after me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give them eternal life; they will never come to destruction, and no one will ever take them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That which my Father has given to me has more value than all; and no one is able to take anything out of the Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and my Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews took up stones again to send at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus said to them in answer, I have let you see a number of good works from the Father; for which of those works are you stoning me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This was their answer: We are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words; because being a man you make yourself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>In answer, Jesus said, Is there not a saying in your law, I said, You are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he said they were gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Writings may not be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Do you say of him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, Your words are evil; because I said, I am God's Son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not have belief in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I am doing them, then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me; so that you may see clearly and be certain that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then again they made an attempt to take him; but he got away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he went again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John first gave baptism; and he was there for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And a great number of people came to him, saying, John did no sign: but everything John said of this man was true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And a number came to have faith in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
