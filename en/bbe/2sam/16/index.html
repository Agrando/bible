And Ziba said, The asses are for the use of the king's people, and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men; and the wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said, He is still at Jerusalem: for he said, Today Israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said to Ziba, Truly everything which was Mephibosheth's is yours. And Ziba said, I give honour to my lord, may I have grace in your eyes, my lord, O king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when King David came to Bahurim, a man of Saul's family named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there, calling curses after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he sent stones at David and at all the king's servants and at all the people and at all the men of war by his side, on the right hand and on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Shimei said, with curses, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, you good-for-nothing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord has sent punishment on you for all the blood of the family of Saul, whose kingdom you have taken; and the Lord has given the kingdom to Absalom, your son: now you yourself are taken in your evil, because you are a man of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, Is this dead dog to go on cursing my lord the king? let me go over and take off his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him go on cursing, for the Lord has said, Put a curse on David, and who then may say, Why have you done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, You see how my son, the offspring of my body, has made designs against my life: how much more then may this Benjamite do so? Let him be, and let him go on cursing; for the Lord has given him orders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that the Lord will take note of my wrongs, and give me back good in answer to his cursing of me today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So David and his men went on their way: and Shimei went by the hillside parallel with them, cursing and sending stones and dust at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king and his people came tired to Jordan, and took their rest there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Absalom and the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom and said, Long life to the king, long life to the king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Absalom said, Is this your love for your friend? why did you not go with your friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Hushai said to Absalom, Not so; I am for that man whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel have taken as king, and I will take my place with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And more than this! where is my place as a servant? is it not before his son? as I have been your father's servant, so will I be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your opinion now, what are we to do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's women who are here looking after his house; then all Israel will have the news that you are hated by your father, and the hands of your supporters will be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they put up the tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's women before the eyes of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In those days the opinions of Ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a man might get direction from God; so were they valued by David as much as by Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
