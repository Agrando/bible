And David went and took the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the town of David with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when those who were lifting the ark of the Lord had gone six steps, he made an offering of an ox and a fat young beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David, clothed in a linen ephod, was dancing before the Lord with all his strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So David and all the men of Israel took up the ark of the Lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the ark of the Lord came into the town of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looking out of the window, saw King David dancing and jumping before the Lord; and to her mind he seemed foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they took in the ark of the Lord, and put it in its place inside the tent which David had put up for it: and David made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after David had made the burned offerings and the peace-offerings, he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord of armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he gave to every man and woman among all the people, among all the masses of Israel, a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes. Then all the people went away, every man to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David came back to give a blessing to his family. And Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to him and said, How full of glory was the king of Israel today, who let himself be seen uncovered by his servant-girls like a foolish person uncovering himself without shame!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David said to Michal, I was dancing before the Lord, who put me over your father and all his sons, to make me a ruler over the people of the Lord, over his people Israel: and I will go on playing before the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will do even worse than this, and make myself even lower in your eyes: but the servant-girls of whom you were talking will give me honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child till the day of her death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
