my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the waves of death came round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he went through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he made the dark his tent round him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the deep beds of the sea were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of the Lord's wrath, because of the breath of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He made me free from my strong hater, from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came on me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of pride, to make them low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For you are my light, O Lord; and the Lord will make the dark bright for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in: by the help of my God I have gone over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for God, his way is all good: the word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is God but the Lord? and who is a Rock but our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You have given me the breastplate of your salvation, and your mercy has made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet make no slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth, stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You have made me free from the fightings of my people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority: from the time when my name comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They will be wasted away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He makes me free from my haters: I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
