So he got up and went to Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Absalom at the same time sent watchers through all the tribes of Israel to say, At the sound of the horn you are to say, Absalom is king in Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And with Absalom, at his request, went two hundred men from Jerusalem, who were completely unconscious of his designs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, one of David's helpers, from Giloh his town, while he was making the offerings. And the design against David became strong, for more and more people were joined to Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one came to David and said, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Come, let us go in flight, or not one of us will be safe from Absalom: let us go without loss of time, or he will overtake us quickly and send evil on us, and put the town to the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king's servants said to the king, See, your servants are ready to do whatever the king says is to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the king went out, taking with him all the people of his house, but for ten of his women, who were to take care of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king went out, and all his servants went after him, and made a stop at the Far House.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all the people went on by his side; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the men of Ittai of Gath, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, went on before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why are you coming with us? go back and keep with the king: for you are a man of another country, you are far from the land of your birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It was only yesterday you came to us; why then am I to make you go up and down with us? for I have to go where I may; go back then, and take your countrymen with you, and may the Lord's mercy and good faith be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ittai the Gittite in answer said, By the living Lord, and by the life of my lord the king, in whatever place my lord the king may be, for life or death, there will your servant be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said to Ittai, Go forward, then. And Ittai the Gittite went on, with all his men and all the little ones he had with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through; and the king himself was waiting in the Kidron valley and all the people went by him in the direction of the olive-tree on the edge of the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Zadok came, and Abiathar, and with them the ark of God's agreement: and they put down the ark of God, till all the people from the town had gone by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said to Zadok, Take the ark of God back into the town: if I have grace in the eyes of the Lord, he will let me come back and see it and his House again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if he says, I have no delight in you: then, here I am; let him do to me what seems good to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king said further to Zadok the priest, See, you and Abiathar are to go back to the town in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz, your son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>See, I will be waiting at the way across the river, in the waste land, till I get news from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and did not go away from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And David went up the slopes of the Mount of Olives weeping all the way, with his head covered and no shoes on his feet: and all the people who were with him, covering their heads, went up weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And word came to David, saying, Ahithophel is among those who are joined to Absalom. And David said, O Lord, let the wisdom of Ahithophel be made foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when David had come to the top of the slope, where they gave worship to God, Hushai the Archite came to him in great grief with dust on his head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>David said to him, If you go on with me, you will be a trouble to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But if you go back to the town and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as in the past I have been your father's servant, so now I will be yours: then you will be able to keep Ahithophel's designs against me from being put into effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And have you not there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? so whatever comes to your ears from the king's house, give word of it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>See, they have with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar; by them you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So Hushai, David's friend, went into the town, and Absalom came to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
