And the Lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers, I will put in your place your seed after you, the offspring of your body, and I will make his kingdom strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He will be the builder of a house for my name, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son: if he does wrong, I will give him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But my mercy will not be taken away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever: the seat of your authority will never be overturned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this was only a small thing to you, O Lord God; but your words have even been about the far-off future of your servant's family, O Lord God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>What more may David say to you? for you have knowledge of your servant, O Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because of your word and from your heart, you have done all this great work, and let your servant see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Truly you are great, O Lord God: there is no one like you and no other God but you, as is clear from everything which has come to our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his people, and to make a name for himself, and to do great and strange things for them, driving out a nation and its gods from before his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But you took and made strong for yourself your people Israel, to be your people for ever; and you, Lord, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O Lord God, may the word which you have said about your servant and about his family, be made certain for ever, and may you do as you have said!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let your name be made great for ever, and let men say, The Lord of armies is God over Israel: and let the family of David your servant be made strong before you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For you, O Lord of armies, the God of Israel, have clearly said to your servant, I will make you the head of a family of kings: and so it has come into your servant's heart to make this prayer to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Lord God, you are God and your words are true and you have said you will give your servant this good thing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So may it be your pleasure to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever before you: (for you, O Lord God, have said it,) and may your blessing be on your servant's family line for ever!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
