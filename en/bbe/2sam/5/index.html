And this is why they say, The blind and feeble-footed may not come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David took the strong tower for his living-place, naming it the town of David. And David took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David became greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of armies, was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to David, with cedar-trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers: and they made David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel, and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took more women and wives in Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and he had more sons and daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These are the names of those whose birth took place in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over Israel, they all went up in search of David; and David, hearing of it, went down to the strong place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the Philistines came, they went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David, desiring directions from the Lord, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? will you give them up into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up, for I will certainly give up the Philistines into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David went to Baal-perazim, and overcame them there; and he said, The Lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters. So that place was named Baal-perazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Philistines, when they went in flight, did not take their images with them, and David and his men took them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Philistines came up again, and went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when David went for directions to the Lord, he said, You are not to go up against them in front; but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spice-trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go forward quickly, for the Lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did as the Lord had said; and he overcame the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon to near Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
