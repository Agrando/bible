For it was the purpose of the Lord to make the wise designs of Ahithophel without effect, so that the Lord might send evil on Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, This is the suggestion made by Ahithophel to Absalom and the responsible men of Israel, and this is what I said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So now send the news quickly to David, and say, Do not take your night's rest by the way across the river to the waste land, but be certain to go over; or the king and all the people with him will come to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by En-rogel; and a servant-girl went from time to time and gave them news and they went with the news to King David, for it was not wise for them to let themselves be seen coming into the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But a boy saw them, and gave word of it to Absalom: so the two of them went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a water-hole in his garden, and they went down into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a woman put a cover over the hole, and put crushed grain on top of it, and no one had any knowledge of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house and said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone from here to the stream. And after searching for them, and seeing nothing of them, they went back to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then after the servants had gone away, they came up out of the water-hole and went to give King David the news; and they said, Get up and go quickly over the water, for such and such are Ahithophel's designs against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So David and all the people who were with him went up over Jordan: when dawn came, every one of them had gone over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when Ahithophel saw that his suggestion was not acted on, he got his ass ready, and went back to his house, to the town where he came from, and having put his house in order, he put himself to death by hanging; so he came to his end and was put in the resting-place of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom, with all the men of Israel, went over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Absalom put Amasa at the head of the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had been the lover of Abigail, the daughter of Jesse, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Israel and Absalom put up their tents in the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi, the son of Nahash of Rabbah, the Ammonite, and Machir, the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Came with beds and basins and pots, and grain and meal, and all sorts of dry foods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And honey and butter and sheep and milk-cheeses, for David and his people: for they said, This people is in the waste land, needing food and drink and rest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
