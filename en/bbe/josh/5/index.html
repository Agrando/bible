So that place was named Gilgal, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the children of Israel put up their tents in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the lowlands of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And on the day after the Passover, they had for their food the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and dry grain on the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was no more manna from the day after they had for their food the produce of the land; the children of Israel had manna no longer, but that year the produce of the land of Canaan was their food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Joshua was near Jericho, lifting up his eyes he saw a man in front of him, with his sword uncovered in his hand: and Joshua went up to him and said, Are you for us or against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, No; but I have come as captain of the armies of the Lord. Then Joshua, falling down with his face to the earth in worship, said, What has my lord to say to his servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the captain of the Lord's army said to Joshua, Take off your shoes from your feet, for the place where you are is holy. And Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
