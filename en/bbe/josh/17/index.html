As for Machir, the oldest son of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war he had Gilead and Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And as for the rest of the children of Manasseh, their heritage was given to them by families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, by their families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they came before Eleazar the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and before the chiefs, saying, The Lord gave orders to Moses to give us a heritage among our brothers: so in agreement with the orders of the Lord he gave them a heritage among their father's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ten parts were given to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Because the daughters of Manasseh had a heritage among his sons, and the land of Gilead was the property of the other sons of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the limit of Manasseh's land was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; the line goes on to the right hand, to the people of En-tappuah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The land of Tappuah was the property of Manasseh; but Tappuah on the edge of Manasseh was the property of the children of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the limit goes down to the stream Kanah, to the south of the stream: these towns were Ephraim's among the towns of Manasseh; Manasseh's limit was on the north side of the stream, ending at the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To the south it is Ephraim's, and to the north it is Manasseh's, and the sea is his limit; and they are touching Asher on the north, and Issachar on the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its daughter-towns, and Ibleam and its daughter-towns, and the people of Dor and its daughter-towns, and the people of En-dor and its daughter-towns, and the people of Taanach and its daughter-towns, and the people of Megiddo and its daughter-towns, that is, the three hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the children of Manasseh were not able to make the people of those towns go out; but the Canaanites would go on living in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the children of Israel had become strong, they put the Canaanites to forced work, in place of driving them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the children of Joseph said to Joshua, Why have you given me only one part and one stretch of land for my heritage?
