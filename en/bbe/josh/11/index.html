you are to have the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and made an attack on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Israel, and they overcame them driving them back to great Zidon and to Misrephoth-maim and into the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they put them all to death, no man got away safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua did to them as the Lord had said to him; he had the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>At that time, Joshua went on to take Hazor and put its king to the sword: for in earlier times Hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they put every person in it to death without mercy, giving every living thing up to the curse, and burning Hazor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the towns of these kings, and all the kings, Joshua took, and put them to the sword: he gave them up to the curse, as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the towns made on hills of earth, not one was burned by Israel but Hazor, which was burned by Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the goods taken from these towns, and their cattle, the children of Israel kept for themselves; but every man they put to death without mercy, till their destruction was complete, and there was no one living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the Lord had given orders to Moses his servant, so Moses gave orders to Joshua, and so Joshua did; every order which the Lord had given to Moses was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland and the Arabah, the hill-country of Israel and its lowland;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon: and all their kings he overcame and put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For a long time Joshua made war on all those kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Not one town made peace with the children of Israel, but only the Hivites of Gibeon: they took them all in war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Lord made them strong in heart to go to war against Israel, so that he might give them up to the curse without mercy, and that destruction might come on them, as the Lord had given orders to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Joshua came at that time and put an end to the Anakim in the hill-country, in Hebron, in Debir, in Anab, and in all the hill-country of Judah and Israel: Joshua gave them and their towns to the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Not one of the Anakim was to be seen in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, some were still living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Joshua took all the land, as the Lord had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it to the children of Israel as their heritage, making division of it among them by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
