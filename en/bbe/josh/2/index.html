So they went and came to the house of a loose woman of the town, named Rahab, where they took their rest for the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it was said to the king of Jericho, See, some men have come here tonight from the children of Israel with the purpose of searching out the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Send out the men who have come to you and are in your house; for they have come with the purpose of searching out all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the woman took the two men and put them in a secret place; then she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I had no idea where they came from;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when it was the time for shutting the doors at dark, they went out; I have no idea where the men went: but if you go after them quickly, you will overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But she had taken them up to the roof, covering them with the stems of flax which she had put out in order there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the men went after them on the road to Jordan as far as the river-crossing: and when they had gone out after them, the door into the town was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And before the men went to rest, she came up to them on the roof,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And said to them, It is clear to me that the Lord has given you the land, and that the fear of you has come on us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For we have had news of how the Lord made the Red Sea dry before you when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, on the other side of Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you gave up to the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And because of this news, our hearts became like water, and there was no more spirit in any of us because of you; for the Lord your God is God in heaven on high and here on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So now, will you give me your oath by the Lord, that, because I have been kind to you, you will be kind to my father's house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And that you will keep safe my father and mother and my brothers and sisters and all they have, so that death may not come on us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the men said to her, Our life for yours if you keep our business secret; and when the Lord has given us the land, we will keep faith and be kind to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then she let them down from the window by a cord, for the house where she was living was on the town wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said to them, Get away into the hill-country, or the men who have gone after you will overtake you; keep yourselves safe there for three days, till the searchers have come back, and then go on your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men said to her, We will only be responsible for this oath which you have made us take,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If, when we come into the land, you put this cord of bright red thread in the window from which you let us down; and get your father and mother and your brothers and all your family into the house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then if anyone goes out of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, we will not be responsible; but if any damage comes to anyone in the house, his blood will be on our heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if you say anything about our business here, then we will be free from the oath you have made us take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, Let it be as you say. Then she sent them away, and they went; and she put the bright red cord in the window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they went into the hill-country and were there three days, till the men who had gone after them had come back; and those who went after them were searching for them everywhere without coming across them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the two men came down from the hill-country and went over and came back to Joshua, the son of Nun; and they gave him a complete account of what had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they said to Joshua, Truly, the Lord has given all the land into our hands; and all the people of the land have become like water because of us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
