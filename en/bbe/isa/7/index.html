And the king's heart, and the hearts of his people, were moved, like the trees of the wood shaking in the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the Lord said to Isaiah, Go out now, you and Shear-jashub, your son, and you will come across Ahaz at the end of the stream flowing from the higher pool, in the highway of the washerman's field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And say to him, Take care and be quiet; have no fear, and do not let your heart be feeble, because of these two ends of smoking fire-wood, because of the bitter wrath of Rezin and Aram, and of the son of Remaliah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because Aram has made evil designs against you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let us go up against Judah, troubling her, and forcing our way into her, and let us put up a king in her, even the son of Tabeel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>This is the word of the Lord God: This design will not come about or be effected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin (and in sixty-five years from now Ephraim will be broken, and will no longer be a people):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not have faith, your kingdom will be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Isaiah said again to Ahaz,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Make a request to the Lord your God for a sign, a sign in the deep places of the underworld, or in the high heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Ahaz said, I will not put the Lord to the test by making such a request.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, Give ear now, O family of David: is it not enough that you are driving men to disgust? will you do the same to my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this cause the Lord himself will give you a sign; a young woman is now with child, and she will give birth to a son, and she will give him the name Immanuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Butter and honey will be his food, when he is old enough to make a decision between evil and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For before the child is old enough to make a decision between evil and good, the land whose two kings you are now fearing will have become waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Lord is about to send on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, such a time of trouble as there has not been from the days of the separating of Ephraim from Judah; even the coming of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it will be in that day that the Lord will make a piping sound for the fly which is in the end of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they will come, covering all the waste valleys, and the holes of the rocks, and the thorns, and all the watering-places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day will the Lord take away the hair of the head and of the feet, as well as the hair of the face, with a blade got for a price from the other side of the River; even with the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will be in that day that a man will give food to a young cow and two sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they will give so much milk that he will be able to have butter for his food: for butter and honey will be the food of all who are still living in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it will be in that day that in every place where before there were a thousand vines valued at a thousand shekels of silver, there will be nothing but blackberries and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Men will come there with bows and arrows, because all the land will be full of blackberries and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they will send out the oxen and the sheep on all the hills which before were worked with the spade, ... fear of blackberries and thorns.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
