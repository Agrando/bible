And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, The Lord says, Put your house in order; for your death is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Hezekiah, turning his face to the wall, made his prayer to the Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>O Lord, keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart, and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Go to Hezekiah, and say, The Lord, the God of David, your father, says, Your prayer has come to my ears, and I have seen your weeping: see, I will give you fifteen more years of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of Assyria: and I will keep watch over this town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Isaiah said, This is the sign the Lord will give you, that he will do what he has said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>See, I will make the shade which has gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun, go back ten steps.
