These things will I do and will not give them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They will be turned back and be greatly shamed who put their hope in pictured images, who say to metal images, You are our gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Give ear, you whose ears are shut; and let your eyes be open, you blind, so that you may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is blind, but my servant? who has his ears stopped, but he whom I send? who is blind as my true one, or who has his ears shut like the Lord's servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Seeing much, but keeping nothing in mind; his ears are open, but there is no hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It was the Lord's pleasure, because of his righteousness, to make the teaching great and give it honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But this is a people whose property has been taken away from them by force; they are all taken in holes, and shut up in prisons: they are made prisoners, and no one makes them free; they are taken by force and no one says, Give them back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who is there among you who will give ear to this? who will give attention to it for the time to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave up Jacob to those who took away his goods, and Israel to his attackers? Did not the Lord? he against whom they did wrong, and in whose ways they would not go, turning away from his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this reason he let loose on him the heat of his wrath, and his strength was like a flame; and it put fire round about him, but he did not see it; he was burned, but did not take it to heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
