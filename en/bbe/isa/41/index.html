His who sent out the generations from the start. I the Lord, the first, and with the last, I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The sea-lands saw it, and were in fear; the ends of the earth were shaking: they came near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They gave help everyone to his neighbour; and everyone said to his brother, Take heart!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the metal-worker put heart into the gold-worker, and he who was hammering the metal smooth said kind words to the iron-worker, saying of the plate, It is ready: and he put it together with nails, so that there might be no slipping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for you, Israel, my servant, and you, Jacob, whom I have taken for myself, the seed of Abraham my friend:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and sent for from its farthest parts, saying to you, You are my servant, whom I have taken for myself, and whom I have not given up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have no fear, for I am with you; do not be looking about in trouble, for I am your God; I will give you strength, yes, I will be your helper; yes, my true right hand will be your support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, all those who are angry with you will be made low and put to shame: those desiring to do you wrong will come to nothing and never again be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You will make search for your haters but they will not be there; those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I, the Lord your God, have taken your right hand in mine, saying to you, Have no fear; I will be your helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Have no fear, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will be your helper, says the Lord, even he who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See, I will make you like a new grain-crushing instrument with teeth, crushing the mountains small, and making the hills like dry stems.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will send the wind over them, and it will take them away; they will go in all directions before the storm-wind: you will have joy in the Lord, and be glad in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The poor and crushed are looking for water where no water is, and their tongue is dry for need of it: I the Lord will give ear to their prayer, I the God of Israel will not give them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will make rivers on the dry mountain-tops, and fountains in the valleys: I will make the waste land a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will put in the waste land the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive-tree; and in the lowland will be planted the fir-tree, the plane, and the cypress together:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So that they may see and be wise and give their mind to it, and that it may be clear to them all that the hand of the Lord has done this, and that the Holy One of Israel has made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Put forward your cause, says the Lord; let your strong argument come out, says the King of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let the future be made clear to us: give us news of the past things, so that we may give thought to them; or of the things to come, so that we may see if they are true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give us word of what will be after this, so that we may be certain that you are gods: yes, do good or do evil, so that we may all see it and be surprised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But you are nothing, and your work is of no value: foolish is he who takes you for his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have sent for one from the north, and from the dawn he has come; in my name he will get rulers together and go against them; they will be like dust, even as the wet earth is stamped on by the feet of the potter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Who has given knowledge of it from the first, so that we may be certain of it? and from the start, so that we may say, His word is true? There is no one who gives news, or says anything, or who gives ear to your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I was the first to give word of it to Zion, and I gave the good news to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I saw that there was no man, even no wise man among them, who might give an answer to my questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Truly they are all nothing, their works are nothing and of no value: their metal images are of no more use than wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
