I will even make a way in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The beasts of the field will give me honour, the jackals and the ostriches: because I send out waters in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country, to give drink to the people whom I have taken for myself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Even the people whom I made to be the witnesses of my praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have made no prayer to me, O Jacob: and you have given no thought to me, O Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You have not made me burned offerings of sheep, or given me honour with your offerings of beasts; I did not make you servants to give me an offering, and I did not make you tired with requests for perfumes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You have not got me sweet-smelling plants with your money, or given me pleasure with the fat of your offerings: but you have made me a servant to your sins, and you have made me tired with your evil doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I, even I, am he who takes away your sins; and I will no longer keep your evil doings in mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Put me in mind of this; let us take up the cause between us: put forward your cause, so that you may be seen to be in the right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Your first father was a sinner, and your guides have gone against my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Your chiefs have made my holy place unclean, so I have made Jacob a curse, and Israel a thing of shame.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
