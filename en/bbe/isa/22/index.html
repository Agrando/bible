Why have all your people gone up to the house-tops?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You, who are full of loud voices, a town of outcries, given up to joy; your dead men have not been put to the sword, or come to their death in war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All your rulers ... have gone in flight; all your strong ones have gone far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For this cause I have said, Let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping; I will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it is a day of trouble and of crushing down and of destruction from the Lord, the Lord of armies, in the valley of vision; ...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elam was armed with arrows, and Aram came on horseback; and the breastplate of Kir was uncovered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And your most fertile valleys were full of war-carriages, and the horsemen took up their positions in front of the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He took away the cover of Judah; and in that day you were looking with care at the store of arms in the house of the woods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you saw all the broken places in the wall of the town of David: and you got together the waters of the lower pool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you had the houses of Jerusalem numbered, pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool: but you gave no thought to him who had done this, and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in that day the Lord, the Lord of armies, was looking for weeping, and cries of sorrow, cutting off of the hair, and putting on the clothing of grief:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But in place of these there was joy and delight, oxen and sheep were being made ready for food, there was feasting and drinking: men said, Now is the time for food and wine, for tomorrow death comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord of armies said to me secretly, Truly, this sin will not be taken from you till your death, says the Lord, the Lord of armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord, the Lord of armies, says, Go to this person in authority, this Shebna, who is over the house; who has made himself a resting-place on high, cutting out a place for himself in the rock, and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who are you, and by what right have you made for yourself a resting-place here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>See, O strong man, the Lord will send you violently away, gripping you with force,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Twisting you round and round like a ball he will send you out into a wide country: there you will come to your end, and there will be the carriages of your pride, O shame of your lord's house!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will have you forced out of your place of authority, and pulled down from your position.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in that day I will send for my servant, Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will put your robe on him, and put your band about him, and I will give your authority into his hand: and he will be a father to the men of Jerusalem, and to the family of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will give the key of the family of David into his care; and what he keeps open will be shut by no one, and what he keeps shut no one will make open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will put him like a nail in a safe place; and he will be for a seat of glory to his father's family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the glory of his father's family will be hanging on him, all their offspring, every small vessel, even the cups and the basins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In that day, says the Lord of armies, will the nail fixed in a safe place give way; and it will be cut down, and in its fall the weight hanging on it will be cut off, for the Lord has said it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
