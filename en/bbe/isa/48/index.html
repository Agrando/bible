I am now making clear new things, even secret things, of which you had no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have only now been effected, and not in the past: and before this day they had not come to your ears; for fear that you might say, I had knowledge of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Truly you had no word of them, no knowledge of them; no news of them in the past had come to your ears; because I saw how false was your behaviour, and that your heart was turned against me from your earliest days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because of my name I will put away my wrath, and for my praise I will keep myself from cutting you off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>See, I have been testing you for myself like silver; I have put you through the fire of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For myself, even because of my name, I will do it; for I will not let my name be shamed; and my glory I will not give to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Give ear to me, Jacob, and Israel, my loved one; I am he, I am the first and I am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yes, by my hand was the earth placed on its base, and by my right hand the heavens were stretched out; at my word they take up their places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Come together, all of you, and give ear; who among you has given news of these things? the Lord's loved one will do his pleasure with Babylon, and with the seed of the Chaldaeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have given the word; I have sent for him: I have made him come, and have given effect to his undertakings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come near to me, and give ear to this; from the start I did not keep it secret; from the time of its coming into existence I was there: and now the Lord God has sent me, and given me his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Lord who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel, says, I am the Lord your God, who is teaching you for your profit, guiding you by the way in which you are to go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If only you had given ear to my orders, then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your seed would have been like the sand, and your offspring like the dust: your name would not be cut off or come to an end before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go out of Babylon, go in flight from the Chaldaeans; with the sound of song make it clear, give the news, let the word go out even to the end of the earth: say, The Lord has taken up the cause of his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They had no need of water when he was guiding them through the waste lands: he made water come out of the rock for them: the rock was parted and the waters came flowing out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, says the Lord, for the evil-doers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
