Every head is tired and every heart is feeble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The body, from head to foot, is all diseased; it is a mass of open wounds, marks of blows, and broken flesh: the flow of blood has not been stopped, and no oil has been put on the wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country has become waste; your towns are burned with fire; as for your land, it is overturned before your eyes, made waste and overcome by men from strange lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion has become like a tent in a vine-garden, like a watchman's house in a field of fruit, like a town shut in by armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If the Lord of armies had not kept some at least of us safe, we would have been like Sodom, and the fate of Gomorrah would have been ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Give ear to the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; let your hearts be turned to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What use to me is the number of the offerings which you give me? says the Lord; your burned offerings of sheep, and the best parts of fat cattle, are a weariness to me; I take no pleasure in the blood of oxen, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At whose request do you come before me, making my house unclean with your feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Give me no more false offerings; the smoke of burning flesh is disgusting to me, so are your new moons and Sabbaths and your holy meetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your regular feasts are a grief to my soul: they are a weight in my spirit; I am crushed under them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when your hands are stretched out to me, my eyes will be turned away from you: even though you go on making prayers, I will not give ear: your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be washed, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; let there be an end of sinning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Take pleasure in well-doing; let your ways be upright, keep down the cruel, give a right decision for the child who has no father, see to the cause of the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now, and let us have an argument together, says the Lord: how may your sins which are red like blood be white as snow? how may their dark purple seem like wool?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you will give ear to my word and do it, the good things of the land will be yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if your hearts are turned against me, I will send destruction on you by the sword; so the Lord has said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The upright town has become untrue; there was a time when her judges gave right decisions, when righteousness had a resting-place in her, but now she is full of those who take men's lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your silver is no longer true metal, your wine is mixed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your chiefs have gone against the Lord, they have become friends of thieves; every one of them is looking for profit and going after rewards; they do not give right decisions for the child who has no father, and they do not let the cause of the widow come before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this reason the Lord, the Lord of armies, the Strong One of Israel, has said, I will put an end to my haters, and send punishment on those who are against me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And my hand will again be on you, washing away what is unclean as with soap, and taking away all your false metal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will give you judges again as at the first, and wise guides as in the past; then you will be named, The Town of Righteousness, the true town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Upright acts will be the price of Zion's forgiveness, and by righteousness will men be living there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But a common destruction will overtake sinners and evil-doers together, and those who have gone away from the Lord will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire, and because of the gardens of your pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry, and like a garden without water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong will be as food for the fire, and his work as a flame; and they will be burned together, with no one to put out the fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
