For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ho! Assyrian, the rod of my wrath, the instrument of my punishment!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will send him against a nation of wrongdoers, and against the people of my wrath I will give him orders, to take their wealth in war, crushing them down like the dust in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But this is not what is in his mind, and this is not his design; but his purpose is destruction, and the cutting off of more and more nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he says, Are not all my captains kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will not the fate of Calno be like that of Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As my hand has come on the kingdoms of the images, whose pictured images were more in number than those of Jerusalem and Samaria;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So, as I have done to Samaria and her images, I will do to Jerusalem and her images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this cause it will be that, when the purpose of the Lord against Mount Zion and Jerusalem is complete, I will send punishment on the pride of the heart of the king of Assyria, and on the glory of his uplifted eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my knowledge, for I am wise: and I have taken away the limits of the peoples' lands, and the stores of their wealth have become mine; and I have made towns low in the dust, sending destruction on those living in them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I have put my hands on the wealth of the peoples, as on the place where a bird has put her eggs; and as a man may take the eggs from which a bird has gone, so I have taken all the earth for myself: and not a wing was moved, and not a mouth gave out a sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Will the axe say high-sounding words against him who is using it, or the blade be full of pride against him who is cutting with it? As if a rod had the power of shaking him who is using it, or as if a stick might take up him who is not wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this cause the Lord, the Lord of armies, will make his fat become wasted; and in his inner parts a fire will be lighted like a burning flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: wasting and burning up his thorns in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he will put an end to the glory of his woods and of his planted fields, soul and body together; and it will be as when a man is wasted by disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the trees of his wood will be small in number, so that a child may put them down in writing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it will be in that day that the rest of Israel, and those of Jacob who have come safely through these troubles, will no longer go for help to him whose rod was on their back, but their faith will be in the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The rest, even the rest of Jacob, will come back to the Strong God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though your people, O Israel, are as the sand of the sea, only a small number will come back: for the destruction is fixed, overflowing in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the Lord, the Lord of armies, is about to make destruction complete in all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this cause the Lord, the Lord of armies, says, O my people living in Zion, have no fear of the Assyrian, even if his rod comes on your back, and his stick is lifted up as in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For in a very short time my passion will be over, and my wrath will be turned to their destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the Lord of armies will be shaking a whip against him, as when he overcame Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be lifted up against them as it was against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in that day the weight which he put on your back will be taken away, and his yoke broken from off your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He has gone up from Pene-Rimmon, he has come to Aiath; he has gone past Migron, at Michmash he puts his forces in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They have gone across the mountain; Geba will be our resting-place tonight, they say: Ramah is shaking with fear; Gibeah of Saul has gone in flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give a loud cry, daughter of Gallim; let Laishah give ear; let Anathoth give answer to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Madmenah has gone; the men of Gebim are putting their goods in a safe place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This very day he is stopping at Nob; he is shaking his hand against the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>See, the Lord, the Lord of armies, is cutting off his branches with a great noise, and his strong ones are falling and his high ones are coming down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he is cutting down the thick places of the wood with an axe, and Lebanon with its tall trees is coming down.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
