Then the Lord said to me, Give him the name Maher-shalal-hash-baz,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For before the child is able to say, Father, or, Mother, the wealth of Damascus and the goods of Samaria will be taken away by the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord said again to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Because this people will have nothing to do with the softly-flowing waters of Shiloah, and have fear of Rezin and Remaliah's son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For this cause the Lord is sending on them the waters of the River, deep and strong, even the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it will come up through all its streams, overflowing all its edges:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it will come on into Judah; rushing on and overflowing, till the waters are up to the neck; *** and his outstretched wings will be covering the land from side to side: for God is with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have knowledge, O peoples, and be in fear; give ear, all you far-off parts of the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let your designs be formed, and they will come to nothing; give your orders, and they will not be effected: for God is with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Lord, controlling me with a strong hand, gave me orders not to go in the way of this people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Do not say, It is holy, about everything of which this people says, It is holy; and do not be in fear of what they go in fear of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But let the Lord of armies be holy to you, and go in fear of him, giving honour to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will be for a holy place: but for a stone of falling and a rock of trouble to the two houses of Israel, and to the men of Jerusalem, for a net in which they may be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And numbers of them, falling on the stone, will be broken, and will be taken in the net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let my teaching be kept secret: and my words be given to my disciples only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will be waiting for the Lord, whose face is veiled from the house of Jacob, and I will be looking for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>See, I and the children whom the Lord has given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of armies, whose resting-place is in Mount Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they say to you, Make request for us to those who have control of spirits, and to those wise in secret arts, who make hollow bird-like sounds; is it not right for a people to make request to their gods, to make request for the living to the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then say to them, Put your faith in the teaching and the witness. ...
