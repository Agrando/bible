And where is the wrath of the cruel one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The prisoner, bent under his chain, will quickly be made free, and will not go down into the underworld, and his bread will not come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I am the Lord your God, who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering: the Lord of armies is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have put my words in your mouth, covering you with the shade of my hand, stretching out the heavens, and placing the earth on its base, and saying to Zion, You are my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Awake! awake! up! O Jerusalem, you who have taken from the Lord's hand the cup of his wrath; tasting in full measure the wine which overcomes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She has no one among all her children to be her guide; not one of the sons she has taken care of takes her by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These two things have come on you; who will be weeping for you? wasting and destruction; death from need of food, and from the sword; how may you be comforted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Your sons are overcome, like a roe in a net; they are full of the wrath of the Lord, the punishment of your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So now give ear to this, you who are troubled and overcome, but not with wine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This is the word of the Lord your master, even your God who takes up the cause of his people: See, I have taken out of your hand the cup which overcomes, even the cup of my wrath; it will not again be given to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will put it into the hand of your cruel masters, and of those whose yoke has been hard on you; who have said to your soul, Down on your face! so that we may go over you: and you have given your backs like the earth, even like the street, for them to go over.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
