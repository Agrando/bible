It was the Lord himself who said to me, Go up against this land and make it waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh, Please make use of the Aramaean language in talking to your servants, for we are used to it, and do not make use of the Jews' language in the hearing of the people on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the Rab-shakeh said, Is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words? has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall? for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the Rab-shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the Jews' language, Give ear to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is what the king says: Do not be tricked by Hezekiah, for there is no salvation for you in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And do not let Hezekiah make you put your faith in the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly keep us safe, and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not give ear to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says, Make peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig-tree, and the water of his spring;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Till I come and take you away to a land like yours, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vine-gardens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Give no attention to Hezekiah when he says to you, The Lord will keep us safe. Has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? where are the gods of Samaria? and have they kept Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hand, to give cause for the thought that the Lord will keep Jerusalem from falling into my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they kept quiet and gave him no answer: for the king's order was, Give him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief, and gave him an account of what the Rab-shakeh had said.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
