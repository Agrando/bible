They will get food by the way wherever they go, and have grass-lands on all the dry mountain-tops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They will not be in need of food or drink, or be troubled by the heat or the sun: for he who has mercy on them will be their guide, taking them by the springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways will be lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>See, these are coming from far; and these from the north and the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let your voice be loud in song, O heavens; and be glad, O earth; make sounds of joy, O mountains, for the Lord has given comfort to his people, and will have mercy on his crushed ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Zion said, The Lord has given me up, I have gone from his memory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Will a woman give up the child at her breast, will she be without pity for the fruit of her body? yes, these may, but I will not let you go out of my memory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>See, your name is marked on my hands; your walls are ever before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your builders are coming quickly; your haters and those who made you waste will go out of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let your eyes be lifted up round about, and see: they are all coming together to you. By my life, says the Lord, truly you will put them all on you as an ornament, and be clothed with them like a bride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For though the waste places of your land have been given to destruction, now you will not be wide enough for your people, and those who made you waste will be far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The children to whom you gave birth in other lands will say in your ears, The place is not wide enough for me: make room for me to have a resting-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then you will say in your heart, Who has given me all these children? when my children had been taken from me, and I was no longer able to have others, who took care of these? when I was by myself, where then were these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This is the word of the Lord God: See, I will make a sign with my hand to the nations, and put up my flag for the peoples; and they will take up your sons on their beasts, and your daughters on their backs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And kings will take care of you, and queens will give you their milk: they will go down on their faces before you, kissing the dust of your feet; and you will be certain that I am the Lord, and that those who put their hope in me will not be shamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Will the goods of war be taken from the strong man, or the prisoners of the cruel one be let go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the Lord says, Even the prisoners of the strong will be taken from him, and the cruel made to let go his goods: for I will take up your cause against your haters, and I will keep your children safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the flesh of your attackers will be taken by themselves for food; and they will take their blood for drink, as if it was sweet wine: and all men will see that I the Lord am your saviour, even he who takes up your cause, the Strong One of Jacob.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
