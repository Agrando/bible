Then I said, Here am I, send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Go, and say to this people, You will go on hearing, but learning nothing; you will go on seeing, but without getting wiser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the hearts of this people fat, and let their ears be stopped, and their eyes shut; for fear that they may see with their eyes, and be hearing with their ears, and their heart may become wise, and they may be turned to me and made well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I said, Lord, how long? And he said in answer, Till the towns are waste and unpeopled, and the houses have no men, and the land becomes completely waste,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Lord has taken men far away, and there are wide waste places in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And even if there is still a tenth part in it, it will again be burned, like a tree of the woods whose broken end is still in the earth after the tree has been cut down (the holy seed is the broken end).</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
