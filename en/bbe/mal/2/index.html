Because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your early years, to whom you have been untrue, though she is your friend and the wife to whom you have given your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>... So give thought to your spirit, and let no one be false to the wife of his early years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I am against the putting away of a wife, says the Lord, the God of Israel, and against him who is clothed with violent acts, says the Lord of armies: so give thought to your spirit and do not be false in your acts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You have made the Lord tired with your words. And still you say, How have we made him tired? By your saying, Everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of the Lord, and he has delight in them; or, Where is God the judge?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
