Come back to me, and I will come back to you, says the Lord of armies. But you say, How are we to come back?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will a man keep back from God what is right? But you have kept back what is mine. But you say, What have we kept back from you? Tenths and offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You are cursed with a curse; for you have kept back from me what is mine, even all this nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let your tenths come into the store-house so that there may be food in my house, and put me to the test by doing so, says the Lord of armies, and see if I do not make the windows of heaven open and send down such a blessing on you that there is no room for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And on your account I will keep back the locusts from wasting the fruits of your land; and the fruit of your vine will not be dropped on the field before its time, says the Lord of armies</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you will be named happy by all nations: for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your words have been strong against me, says the Lord. And still you say, What have we said against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You have said, It is no use worshipping God: what profit have we had from keeping his orders, and going in clothing of sorrow before the Lord of armies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now to us the men of pride seem happy; yes, the evil-doers are doing well; they put God to the test and are safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then those in whom was the fear of the Lord had talk together: and the Lord gave ear, and it was recorded in a book to be kept in mind before him, for those who had the fear of the Lord and gave thought to his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they will be mine, says the Lord, in the day when I make them my special property; and I will have mercy on them as a man has mercy on his son who is his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then you will again see how the upright man is different from the sinner, and the servant of God from him who is not.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
