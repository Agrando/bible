And he said, Put it in the book; for these words are certain and true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, It is done. I am the First and the Last, the start and the end. I will freely give of the fountain of the water of life to him who is in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who overcomes will have these things for his heritage; and I will be his God, and he will be my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But those who are full of fear and without faith, the unclean and takers of life, those who do the sins of the flesh, and those who make use of evil powers or who give worship to images, and all those who are false, will have their part in the sea of ever-burning fire which is the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels in which were the seven last punishments, came and said to me, Come here, and see the bride, the Lamb's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he took me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and let me see the holy town Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Having the glory of God: and her light was like a stone of great price, a jasper stone, clear as glass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She had a wall great and high, with twelve doors, and at the doors twelve angels; and names on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And on the east were three doors; and on the north three doors; and on the south three doors; and on the west three doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the wall of the town had twelve bases, and on them the twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he who was talking with me had a gold measuring-rod to take the measure of the town, and of its doors, and its wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the town is square, as wide as it is long; and he took the measure of the town with the rod, one thousand and five hundred miles: it is equally long and wide and high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he took the measure of its wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, after the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the building of its wall was of jasper, and the town was clear gold, clear as glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The bases of the wall of the town had ornaments of all sorts of beautiful stones. The first base was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the twelve doors were twelve pearls; every door was made of one pearl; and the street of the town was clear gold, as clear as glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw no Temple there; because the Lord God, the Ruler of all, and the Lamb are its Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the town has no need of the sun, or of the moon, to give it light: for the glory of God did make it light, and the light of it is the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the nations will go in its light: and the kings of the earth will take their glory into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the doors of it will never be shut by day (for there is no night there):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the glory and honour of the nations will come into it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And nothing unclean may come into it, or anyone whose works are cursed or false; but only those whose names are in the Lamb's book of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
