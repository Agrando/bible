And every shipmaster, and all who are sailing on the sea, and sailors and all who get their living by the sea, were watching from far away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And crying out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What town is like the great town?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they put dust on their heads, and were sad, weeping and crying, and saying, Sorrow, sorrow for the great town, in which was increased the wealth of all who had their ships on the sea because of her great stores! for in one hour she is made waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Be glad over her, heaven, and you saints, and Apostles, and prophets; because she has been judged by God on your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a strong angel took up a stone like the great stone with which grain is crushed, and sent it into the sea, saying, So, with a great fall, will Babylon, the great town, come to destruction, and will not be seen any more at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the voice of players and makers of music will never again be sounding in you: and no worker, expert in art, will ever again be living in you; and there will be no sound of the crushing of grain any more at all in you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And never again will the shining of lights be seen in you; and the voice of the newly-married man and the bride will never again be sounding in you: for your traders were the lords of the earth, and by your evil powers were all the nations turned out of the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was seen the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been put to death on the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
