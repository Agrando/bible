But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to get angry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this reason, putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be doers of the word, and not only hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For after looking at himself he goes away, and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free, being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect, this man will have a blessing on his acts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false, this man's religion is of no value.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep oneself untouched by the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
