And he said, From a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And frequently it has sent him into the fire and into the water, for his destruction; but if you are able to do anything, have pity on us, and give us help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said to him, If you are able! All things are possible to him who has faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Straight away the father of the child gave a cry, saying, I have faith; make my feeble faith stronger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Jesus saw that the people came running together, he gave orders to the unclean spirit, saying to him, You, spirit, who are the cause of his loss of voice and hearing, I say to you, come out of him, and never again go into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after crying out and shaking him violently, it came out: and the child became like one dead; so that most of them said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took him by the hand, lifting him up; and he got up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had gone into the house, his disciples said to him privately, Why were we unable to send it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, Nothing will make this sort come out but prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they went out from there, through Galilee; and it was his desire that no man might have knowledge of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he was giving his disciples teaching, and saying to them, The Son of man is given up into the hands of men, and they will put him to death; and when he is dead, after three days he will come back from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the saying was not clear to them, and they were in fear of questioning him about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house, he put the question to them, What were you talking about on the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they said nothing: because they had had an argument between themselves on the way, about who was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And seating himself, he made the twelve come to him; and he said to them, If any man has the desire to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took a little child, and put him in the middle of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whoever will give honour to one such little child in my name, gives honour to me: and whoever gives honour to me, gives honour not to me, but to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John said to him, Master, we saw one driving out evil spirits in your name: and we said that he might not, because he is not one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said, Say not so: for there is no man who will do a great work in my name, and be able at the same time to say evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He who is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Whoever gives you a cup of water, because you are Christ's, truly I say to you, he will in no way be without his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if your hand is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off; it is better for you to go into life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell, into the eternal fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if your foot is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off: it is better for you to go into life with one foot than to have two feet and go into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you, take it out: it is better for you to go into the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to go into hell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Where their worm is ever living and the fire is not put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Everyone will be salted with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good; but if the taste goes from it, how will you make it salt again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
