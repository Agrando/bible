Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside is not able to make him unclean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because it goes not into the heart but into the stomach, and goes out with the waste? He said this, making all food clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, That which comes out of the man, that makes the man unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because from inside, from the heart of men, come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The taking of goods and of life, broken faith between husband and wife, the desire of wealth, wrongdoing, deceit, sins of the flesh, an evil eye, angry words, pride, foolish acts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evil things come from inside, and make the man unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he went away from there to the country of Tyre and Sidon. And he went into a house, desiring that no man might have knowledge of it: and he was not able to keep it secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having had news of him, came straight away and went down at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by birth: and she made a request to him that he would send the evil spirit out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to her, Let the children first have their food: for it is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But she said to him in answer, Yes, Lord: even the dogs under the table take the bits dropped by the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the evil spirit has gone out of your daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And she went away to her house, and saw the child on the bed, and the evil spirit gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again he went out from Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the country of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they came to him with one who had no power of hearing and had trouble in talking; and they made a request to him to put his hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took him on one side from the people privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he put water from his mouth on the man's tongue with his finger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking up to heaven, he took a deep breath, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And his ears became open, and the band of his tongue was made loose, and his words became clear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he gave them orders not to give news of it to anyone; but the more he made this request, so much the more they made it public.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they were overcome with wonder, saying, He has done all things well: he even gives back the power of hearing and the power of talking to those who have been without them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
