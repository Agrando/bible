I see well who you are, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus said to him sharply, Be quiet, and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit, shaking him violently, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all greatly surprised, so that they put questions to one another, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits, and they do what he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of Galilee round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they came out of the Synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simon's wife's mother was ill, with a burning heat; and they gave him word of her:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came and took her by the hand, lifting her up; and she became well, and took care of their needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And in the evening, at sundown, they took to him all who were diseased, and those who had evil spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the town had come together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And a number, who were ill with different diseases, he made well, and sent out evil spirits; but he did not let the evil spirits say anything, because they had knowledge of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the morning, a long time before daylight, he got up and went out to a quiet place, and there he gave himself up to prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and those who were with him came after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when they came up with him, they said to him, Everyone is looking for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, Let us go to other parts into the nearest towns, so that I may give teaching there, because for this purpose I came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went into their Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And a leper came to him and, going down on his knees before him, made a request, saying, If it is your pleasure, you have the power to make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And being moved with pity, he put out his hand, and touching him said to him, It is my pleasure; be made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And straight away the disease went from him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he sent him away, saying to him very sharply,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>See that you say nothing to any man: but go and let the priest see you, and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by Moses, for a witness to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out, and made it public, giving an account of it everywhere, so that Jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town, but was outside in the waste land; and they came to him from every part.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
