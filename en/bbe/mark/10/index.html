But Jesus said to them again, Children, how hard it is for those who put faith in wealth to come into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is simpler for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a man of wealth to come into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were greatly surprised, saying to him, Who then may have salvation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus, looking on them, said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter said to him, See, we have given up everything, and come after you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said, Truly I say to you, There is no man who has given up house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, because of me and the good news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Who will not get a hundred times as much now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and land--though with great troubles; and, in the world to come, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But a great number who are first will be last: and those who are last will be first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were full of wonder; but those who came after him were in fear. And again he took the twelve, and gave them word of the things which were to come on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Saying, See, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be given up to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will give an order for his death, and will give him up to the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they will make sport of him, and put shame on him, and give him cruel blows, and will put him to death; and after three days he will come back from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And there came to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying to him, Master, will you give us whatever may be our request?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, What would you have me do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they said to him, Let us be seated, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said to them, You have no knowledge of what you are saying. Are you able to take of my cup? or to undergo the baptism which I am to undergo?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, You will take of the cup from which I take; and the baptism which I am about to undergo you will undergo:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But to be seated at my right hand or at my left is not for me to give: but it is for those for whom it has been made ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And hearing this, the ten became very angry with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus made them come to him, and said to them, You see that those who are made rulers over the Gentiles are lords over them, and their great ones have authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But it is not so among you: but whoever has a desire to become great among you, let him be your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whoever has a desire to be first among you, let him be servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For truly the Son of man did not come to have servants, but to be a servant, and to give his life for the salvation of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they came to Jericho: and when he was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great number of people, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind man, was seated by the wayside, with his hand out for money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when it came to his ears that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he gave a cry, and said, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And some of them, turning in protest, gave him an order to be quiet: but he went on crying out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jesus came to a stop and said, Let him come. And crying out to the blind man, they said to him, Be comforted: come, he has sent for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he, putting off his coat, got up quickly, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus said to him, What would you have me do to you? And the blind man said, Master, make me able to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to him, Go on your way; your faith has made you well. And straight away he was able to see, and went after him in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
