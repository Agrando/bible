And his disciples took note of his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came to Jerusalem; and he went into the Temple, and sent out those who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he would not let any man take a vessel through the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he gave them teaching, and said to them, Is it not in the Writings, My house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations? but you have made it a hole of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes, and they took thought how they might put him to death; being in fear of him, because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And every evening he went out of the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they were going by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dead from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter, having a memory of it, said to him, Master, see, the tree which was cursed by you is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus, answering, said to them, Have God's faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly I say to you, Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and be put into the sea; and has no doubt in his heart, but has faith that what he says will come about, he will have his desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whenever you make a prayer, let there be forgiveness in your hearts, if you have anything against anyone; so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they came again to Jerusalem: and while he was walking in the Temple, there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said to him, By what authority do you do these things? or who gave you authority to do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus said to them, I will put to you one question; give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? give me an answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they gave thought to it among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not have faith in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we say, From men--they were in fear of the people, because all took John to be truly a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they said in answer to Jesus, We have no idea. And Jesus said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
