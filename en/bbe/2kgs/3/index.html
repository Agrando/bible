And he said, I will go with you: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, Which way are we to go? And he said in answer, By the waste land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom by a roundabout way for seven days: and there was no water for the army or for the beasts they had with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel said, Here is trouble: for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them into the hands of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no prophet of the Lord here, through whom we may get directions from the Lord? And one of the king of Israel's men said in answer, Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, who was servant to Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? go to the prophets of your father and your mother. And the king of Israel said, No; for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them up into the hands of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Elisha said, By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am, if it was not for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not give a look at you, or see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But now, get me a player of music, and it will come about that while the man is playing, the hand of the Lord will come on me and I will give you the word of the Lord: and they got a player of music, and while the man was playing, the hand of the Lord was on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, The Lord says, I will make this valley full of water-holes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Lord says, Though you see no wind or rain, the valley will be full of water, and you and your armies and your beasts will have drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this will be only a small thing to the Lord: in addition he will give the Moabites into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you are to put every walled town to destruction, cutting down every good tree, and stopping up every water-spring, and making all the good land rough with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now in the morning, about the time when the offering was made, they saw water flowing from the direction of Edom till the country was full of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now all Moab, hearing that the kings had come to make war against them, got together all who were able to take up arms and went forward to the edge of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And early in the morning they got up, when the sun was shining on the water, and they saw the water facing them as red as blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then they said, This is blood: it is clear that destruction has come on the kings; they have been fighting one another: now come, Moab, let us take their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when they came to the tents of Israel, the Israelites came out and made a violent attack on the Moabites, so that they went in flight before them; and they went forward still attacking them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pulling down the towns, covering every good field with stones, stopping up all the water-springs, and cutting down all the good trees; they went on driving Moab before them till only in Kir-hareseth were there any Moabites; and the fighting-men went round the town raining stones on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the king of Moab saw that the fight was going against him, he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords, with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of Aram, but they were not able to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took his oldest son, who would have been king after him, offering him as a burned offering on the wall. So there was great wrath against Israel; and they went away from him, back to their country.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
