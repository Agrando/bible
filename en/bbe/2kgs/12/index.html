now take no more money from your neighbours, but give it for the building up of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the priests made an agreement to take no more money from the people, and not to make good what was damaged in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and making a hole in the cover of it, put it by the altar, on the right side when one comes into the house of the Lord; and the priests who kept the door put in it regularly all the money which was taken into the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came and put it in bags, noting the amount of all the money there was in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the money which was measured out they gave regularly to those who were responsible for overseeing the work, and these gave it in payment to the woodworkers and the builders who were working on the house of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the wall-builders and the stone-cutters, and to get wood and cut stone for building up the broken parts of the house of the Lord, and for everything needed to put the house in good order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the money was not used for making silver cups or scissors or basins or wind-instruments or any vessels of gold or silver for the house of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But it was all given to the workmen who were building up the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they did not get any statement of accounts from the men to whom the money was given for the workmen, for they made use of it with good faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The money of the offerings for error and the sin-offerings was not taken into the house of the Lord; it was the priests'.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Hazael, king of Aram, went up against Gath and took it; and his purpose was to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the holy things which Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had given to the Lord, together with the things he himself had given, and all the gold in the Temple store and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael, king of Aram; and he went away from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And his servants made a secret design and put Joash to death at the house of Millo on the way down to Silla.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jozacar, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, his servants, came to him and put him to death; and they put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of David; and Amaziah his son became king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
