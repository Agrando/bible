So Jehoash, king of Israel, went up, and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, came face to face at Beth-shemesh, which is in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Judah was overcome before Israel, so that they went in flight, every man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehoash, king of Israel, made Amaziah, king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, prisoner at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of Ephraim to the door in the angle, four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the Lord and in the store-house of the king, together with those whose lives would be the price of broken faith, and went back to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash, and his power, and how he went to war with Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehoash went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son became king in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, went on living for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now they made a secret design against him in Jerusalem; and he went in flight to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in Jerusalem, the town of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He was the builder of Elath, which he got back for Judah after the death of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the fifteenth year of the rule of Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria, ruling for forty-one years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not turning away from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He got back the old limits of Israel from the way into Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, as the Lord had said by his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet of Gath-hepher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the Lord saw how bitter was the trouble of Israel, and that everyone was cut off, he who was shut up and he who went free, and that Israel had no helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Lord had not said that the name of Israel was to be taken away from the earth; but he gave them a saviour in Jeroboam, the son of Joash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all he did, and his power, and how he went to war with Damascus, causing the wrath of the Lord to be turned away from Israel, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jeroboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son became king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
