they did evil things, moving the Lord to wrath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they made themselves servants of disgusting things, though the Lord had said, You are not to do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gave witness to Israel and Judah, by every prophet and seer, saying, Come back from your evil ways, and do my orders and keep my rules, and be guided by the law which I gave to your fathers and sent to you by my servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they did not give ear, but became stiff-necked, like their fathers who had no faith in the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they went against his rules, and the agreement which he made with their fathers, and his laws which he gave them; they gave themselves up to things without sense or value, and became foolish like the nations round them, of whom the Lord had said, Do not as they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And turning their backs on all the orders which the Lord had given them, they made for themselves images of metal, and the image of Asherah, worshipping all the stars of heaven and becoming servants to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they made their sons and their daughters go through the fire, and they made use of secret arts and unnatural powers, and gave themselves up to doing evil in the eyes of the Lord, till he was moved to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the Lord was very angry with Israel, and his face was turned away from them: only the tribe of Judah kept its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(But even Judah did not keep the orders of the Lord their God, but were guided by the rules which Israel had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the Lord would have nothing to do with all the offspring of Israel, and sent trouble on them, and gave them up into the hands of their attackers, till he had sent them away from before his face.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Israel was broken off from the family of David, and they made Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, king, who, driving them away from the laws of the Lord, made them do a great sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the children of Israel went on with all the sins which Jeroboam did; they did not keep themselves from them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Till the Lord put Israel away from before his face, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was taken away from their land to Assyria, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the king of Assyria took men from Babylon and from Cuthah and Avva and Hamath and Sepharvaim, and put them in the towns of Samaria in place of the children of Israel; so they got Samaria for their heritage, living in its towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now when first they were living there they did not give worship to the Lord. So the Lord sent lions among them, causing the death of some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So they said to the king of Assyria, The nations whom you have taken as prisoners and put in the towns of Samaria, have no knowledge of the way of the god of the land: so he has sent lions among them, causing their death, because they have no knowledge of his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the king of Assyria gave orders, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you took away, and let him be living there and teaching the people the way of the god of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So one of the priests whom they had taken away as a prisoner from Samaria came back, and, living in Beth-el, became their teacher in the worship of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every nation made gods for themselves, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the towns where they were living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites gave their children to be burned in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they went on worshipping the Lord, and made for themselves, from among all the people, priests for the high places, to make offerings for them in the houses of the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They gave worship to the Lord, but they gave honour to their gods like the nations did from whom they had been taken as prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So to this day they go on in their old ways, not worshipping the Lord or keeping his orders or his ways or the law and the rule which the Lord gave to the children of Jacob, to whom he gave the name Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the Lord made an agreement with them and gave them orders, saying, You are to have no other gods; you are not to give worship to them or be their servants or make them offerings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt with his great power and his outstretched arm, he is your God, to whom you are to give worship and make offerings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the rules and the orders and the law which he put in writing for you, you are to keep and do for ever; you are to have no other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you are to keep in memory the agreement which I have made with you; and you are to have no other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And you are to give worship to the Lord your God; for it is he who will give you salvation from the hands of all who are against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But they gave no attention, but went on in their old way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So these nations, worshipping the Lord, still were servants to the images they had made; their children and their children's children did the same; as their fathers did, so do they, to this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
