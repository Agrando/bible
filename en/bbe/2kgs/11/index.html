Then Athaliah, violently parting her robes, gave a cry, saying, Broken faith, broken faith!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jehoiada the priest gave orders to those who were placed in authority over the army, saying, Take her outside the lines, and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword, for he said, Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they put their hands on her, and she went to the king's house by the doorway of the horses, and there she was put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and the king and the people, that they would be the Lord's people; and in the same way between the king and the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down: its altars and images were all broken to bits, and Mattan, the priest of Baal, they put to death before the altars. And the priest put overseers over the Lord's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he took the captains of hundreds, and the Carians, and the armed men, and all the people of the land; and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord, through the doorway of the armed men, to the king's house. And he took his place on the seat of the kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So all the people of the land were glad, and the town was quiet; and they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
