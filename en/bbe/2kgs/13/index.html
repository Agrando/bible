Then Elisha said, Let the arrow go; and he let it go. And he said, The Lord's arrow of salvation, of salvation over Aram; for you will overcome the Aramaeans in Aphek and put an end to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Take the arrows: and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Send them down into the earth; and he did so three times and no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the man of God was angry with him and said, If you had done it five or six times, then you would have overcome Aram completely; but now you will only overcome them three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And death came to Elisha and they put his body into the earth. Now in the spring of the year, armed bands of Moabites frequently came, overrunning the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And while they were putting a dead man into the earth, they saw a band coming; and they put the man quickly into the place where Elisha's body was; and the dead man, on touching Elisha's bones, came to life again, and got up on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Israel was crushed under the power of Hazael, king of Aram, all the days of Jehoahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the Lord was kind to them and had pity on them, caring for them, because of his agreement with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; he would not put them to destruction or send them away from before his face till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Hazael, king of Aram, came to his end; and Ben-hadad his son became king in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, took again from Ben-hadad, the son of Hazael, the towns which he had taken from Jehoahaz his father in war. Three times Jehoash overcame him and got back the towns of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
