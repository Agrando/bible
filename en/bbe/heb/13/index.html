So be it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But, brothers, take kindly the words which I have said for your profit; for I have not sent you a long letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Our brother Timothy has been let out of prison; and if he comes here in a short time, he and I will come to you together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you, and to all the saints. Those who are in Italy send you their love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>May grace be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
