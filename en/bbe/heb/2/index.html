For in making man the ruler over all things, God did not put anything outside his authority; though we do not see everything under him now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of God he might undergo death for all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because it was right for him, for whom and through whom all things have being, in guiding his sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family; and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Saying, I will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers, I will make a song of praise to you before the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again he says, I will put my faith in him. And again, See, I am here, and the children which God has given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And because the children are flesh and blood, he took a body himself and became like them; so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death, that is to say, the Evil One;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death, go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, truly, he does not take on the life of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way, so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God, making offerings for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For having been put to the test himself, he is able to give help to others when they are tested.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
