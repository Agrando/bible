And he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the saints of the Most High will take the kingdom, and it will be theirs for ever, even for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, a cause of great fear, whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass; who took his food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping on the rest with his feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up, causing the fall of three; that horn which had eyes, and a mouth saying great things, which seemed to be greater than the other horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Till he came, who was very old, and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints took the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This is what he said: The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom which will come on earth, different from all the kingdoms, and it will overcome all the earth, crushing it down and smashing it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power; and after them another will come up: he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he will say words against the Most High, attempting to put an end to the saints of the Most High; and he will have the idea of changing times and law; and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and half a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the judge will be seated, and they will put an end to his authority, to overcome it and send complete destruction on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Here is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, I was greatly troubled by my thoughts, and the colour went from my face: but I kept the thing in my heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
