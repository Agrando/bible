then you would have put my head in danger from the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Daniel said to the keeper in whose care the captain of the unsexed servants had put Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Put your servants to the test for ten days; let them give us grain for our food and water for our drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then take a look at our faces and the faces of the young men who have food from the king's table; and, having seen them, do to your servants as it seems right to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he gave ear to them in this thing and put them to the test for ten days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And at the end of ten days their faces seemed fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the young men who had their food from the king's table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the keeper regularly took away their meat and the wine which was to have been their drink, and gave them grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now as for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and made them expert in all book-learning and wisdom: and Daniel was wise in all visions and dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now at the end of the time fixed by the king for them to go in, the captain of the unsexed servants took them in to Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the king had talk with them; and among them all there was no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they were given places before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in any business needing wisdom and good sense, about which the king put questions to them, he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonder-workers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Daniel went on till the first year of King Cyrus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
