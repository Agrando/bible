The king made answer and said, Belteshazzar, do not be troubled by the dream or by the sense of it. Belteshazzar, answering, said, My lord, may the dream be about your haters, and its sense about those who are against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree which you saw, which became tall and strong, stretching up to heaven and seen from the ends of the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Which had fair leaves and much fruit, and had in it food for all; under which the beasts of the field were living, and in the branches of which the birds of heaven had their resting-places:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is you, O King, who have become great and strong: for your power is increased and stretching up to heaven, and your rule to the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as for the vision which the king saw of a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, saying, Let the tree be cut down and given to destruction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the sense of it, O King, and it is the decision of the Most High which has come on my lord the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That they will send you out from among men, to be with the beasts of the field; they will give you grass for your food like the oxen, and you will be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will go by you, till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and gives it to any man at his pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they gave orders to let the broken end and the roots of the tree be, so your kingdom will be safe for you after it is clear to you that the heavens are ruling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this cause, O King, let my suggestion be pleasing to you, and let your sins be covered by righteousness and your evil-doing by mercy to the poor, so that the time of your well-being may be longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this came to King Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of his great house in Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king made answer and said, Is this not great Babylon, which I have made for the living-place of kings, by the strength of my power and for the glory of my honour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>While the word was still in the king's mouth, a voice came down from heaven, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is said: The kingdom has gone from you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they will send you out from among men, to be with the beasts of the field; they will give you grass for your food like the oxen, and seven times will go by you, till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and gives it to any man at his pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>That very hour the order about Nebuchadnezzar was put into effect: and he was sent out from among men, and had grass for his food like the oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair became long as eagles' feathers and his nails like those of birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifting up my eyes to heaven, got back my reason, and, blessing the Most High, I gave praise and honour to him who is living for ever, whose rule is an eternal rule and whose kingdom goes on from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all the people of the earth are as nothing: he does his pleasure in the army of heaven and among the people of the earth: and no one is able to keep back his hand, or say to him, What are you doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>At the same time my reason came back to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and my great name came back to me; and my wise men and my lords were turned to me again; and I was made safe in my kingdom and had more power than before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, give worship and praise and honour to the King of heaven; for all his works are true and his ways are right: and those who go in pride he is able to make low.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
