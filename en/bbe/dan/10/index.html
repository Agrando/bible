And at his words I became strong, and said, Let my lord say on, for you have given me strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>\10:20\Then he said, It is clear to you why I have come to you. And now I will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>\10:21\But I am going back to make war with the angel of Persia, and when I am gone, the angel of Greece will come. And there is no one on my side against these, but Michael, your angel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
