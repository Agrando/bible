The king made answer and said, The thing is fixed by the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>\6:13\Then they made answer and said before the king, Daniel, one of the prisoners of Judah, has no respect for you, O King, or for the order signed by you, but three times a day he makes his prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>\6:14\When this thing came to the king's ears, it was very evil to him, and his heart was fixed on keeping Daniel safe, and till the going down of the sun he was doing everything in his power to get him free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>\6:15\Then these men said to the king, Be certain, O King, that by the law of the Medes and Persians no order or law which the king has put into force may be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>\6:16\Then the king gave the order, and they took Daniel and put him into the lions' hole. The king made answer and said to Daniel, Your God, whose servant you are at all times, will keep you safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>\6:17\Then they got a stone and put it over the mouth of the hole, and it was stamped with the king's stamp and with the stamp of the lords, so that the decision about Daniel might not be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>\6:18\Then the king went to his great house, and took no food that night, and no ... were placed before him, and his sleep went from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>\6:19\Then very early in the morning the king got up and went quickly to the lions' hole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>\6:20\And when he came near the hole where Daniel was, he gave a loud cry of grief; the king made answer and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whose servant you are at all times, able to keep you safe from the lions?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>\6:21\Then Daniel said to the king, O King, have life for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>\6:22\My God has sent his angel to keep the lions' mouths shut, and they have done me no damage: because I was seen to be without sin before him; and further, before you, O King, I have done no wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>\6:23\Then the king was very glad, and gave orders for them to take Daniel up out of the hole. So Daniel was taken up out of the hole and he was seen to be untouched, because he had faith in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>\6:24\And at the king's order, they took those men who had said evil against Daniel, and put them in the lions' hole, with their wives and their children; and they had not got to the floor of the hole before the lions overcame them and all their bones were broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>\6:25\Then King Darius sent a letter to all the peoples, nations, and languages, living in all the earth: May your peace be increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>\6:26\It is my order that in all the kingdom of which I am ruler, men are to be shaking with fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, unchanging for ever, and his kingdom is one which will never come to destruction, his rule will go on to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>\6:27\He gives salvation and makes men free from danger, and does signs and wonders in heaven and earth, who has kept Daniel safe from the power of the lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>\6:28\So this Daniel did well in the kingdom of Darius and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
