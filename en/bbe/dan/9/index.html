we have gone against you, turning away from your orders and from your laws:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have not given ear to your servants the prophets, who said words in your name to our kings and our rulers and our fathers and all the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O Lord, righteousness is yours, but shame is on us, even to this day; and on the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem, and on all Israel, those who are near and those who are far off, in all the countries where you have sent them because of the sin which they have done against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O Lord, shame is on us, on our kings and our rulers and our fathers, because of our sin against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With the Lord our God are mercies and forgiveness, for we have gone against him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And have not given ear to the voice of the Lord our God to go in the way of his laws which he put before us by the mouth of his servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all Israel have been sinners against your law, turning away so as not to give ear to your voice: and the curse has been let loose on us, and the oath recorded in the law of Moses, the servant of God, for we have done evil against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he has given effect to his words which he said against us and against those who were our judges, by sending a great evil on us: for under all heaven there has not been done what has been done to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it was recorded in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us: but we have made no prayer for grace from the Lord our God that we might be turned from our evil doings and come to true wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Lord has been watching over this evil and has made it come on us: for the Lord our God is upright in all his acts which he has done, and we have not given ear to his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now, O Lord our God, who took your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand and made a great name for yourself even to this day; we are sinners, we have done evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Lord, because of your righteousness, let your wrath and your passion be turned away from your town Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because, through our sins and the evil-doing of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a cause of shame to all who are round about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, give ear, O our God, to the prayer of your servant and to his request for grace, and let your face be shining on your holy place which is made waste, because of your servants, O Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O my God, let your ear be turned and give hearing; let your eyes be open and see how we have been made waste and the town which is named by your name: for we are not offering our prayers before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, give ear; O Lord, have forgiveness; O Lord, take note and do; let there be no more waiting; for the honour of your name, O my God, because your town and your people are named by your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And while I was still saying these words in prayer, and putting my sins and the sins of my people Israel before the Lord, and requesting grace from the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Even while I was still in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at first when my weariness was great, put his hand on me about the time of the evening offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And teaching me and talking to me he said, O Daniel, I have come now to give you wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the first word of your prayer a word went out, and I have come to give you knowledge; for you are a man dearly loved: so give thought to the word and let the vision be clear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Seventy weeks have been fixed for your people and your holy town, to let wrongdoing be complete and sin come to its full limit, and for the clearing away of evil-doing and the coming in of eternal righteousness: so that the vision and the word of the prophet may be stamped as true, and to put the holy oil on a most holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have then the certain knowledge that from the going out of the word for the building again of Jerusalem till the coming of a prince, on whom the holy oil has been put, will be seven weeks: in sixty-two weeks its building will be complete, with square and earthwork.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And at the end of the times, even after the sixty-two weeks, one on whom the holy oil has been put will be cut off and have no ...; and the town and the holy place will be made waste together with a prince; and the end will come with an overflowing of waters, and even to the end there will be war; the making waste which has been fixed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a strong order will be sent out against the great number for one week; and so for half of the week the offering and the meal offering will come to an end; and in its place will be an unclean thing causing fear; till the destruction which has been fixed is let loose on him who has made waste.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
