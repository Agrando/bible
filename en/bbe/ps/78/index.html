Of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law; let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Opening my mouth I will give out a story, even the dark sayings of old times;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge, as they were given to us by our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not keep them secret from our children; we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the Lord and his strength, and the great works of wonder which he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He put up a witness in Jacob, and made a law in Israel; which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So that the generation to come might have knowledge of them, even the children of the future, who would give word of them to their children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So that they might put their hope in God, and not let God's works go out of their minds, but keep his laws;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And not be like their fathers, a stiff-necked and uncontrolled generation; a generation whose heart was hard, whose spirit was not true to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The children of Ephraim, armed with bows, were turned back on the day of the fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They were not ruled by God's word, and they would not go in the way of his law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They let his works go out of their memory, and the wonders which he had made them see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He did great works before the eyes of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sea was cut in two so that they might go through; the waters were massed together on this side and on that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud, and all through the night with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The rocks of the waste land were broken by his power, and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He made streams come out of the rock; and waters came flowing down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they went on sinning against him even more, turning away from the Most High in the waste land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Testing God in their hearts, requesting meat for their desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said bitter words against God, saying, Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams; is he able to give us bread? is he able to get meat for his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So these things came to the Lord's ears, and he was angry; and a fire was lighted against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they had no faith in God, and no hope in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he gave orders to the clouds on high, and the doors of heaven were open;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he sent down manna like rain for their food, and gave them the grain of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man took part in the food of strong ones; he sent them meat in full measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent an east wind from heaven, driving on the south wind by his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He sent down meat on them like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he let it come down into their resting-place, round about their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they had food and were full; for he gave them their desire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But they were not turned from their desires; and while the food was still in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The wrath of God came on them, and put to death the fattest of them, and put an end to the young men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they went on sinning even more, and had no faith in his great wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So their days were wasted like a breath, and their years in trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he sent death on them, then they made search for him; turning to him and looking for him with care;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In the memory that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But their lips were false to him, and their tongues were untrue to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And their hearts were not right with him, and they did not keep their agreement with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, being full of pity, has forgiveness for sin, and does not put an end to man: frequently turning back his wrath, and not being violently angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So he kept in mind that they were only flesh; a breath which is quickly gone, and will not come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How frequently did they go against him in the waste land, and give him cause for grief in the dry places!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Again they put God to the test, and gave pain to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They did not keep in mind the work of his hand, or the day when he took them from the power of their haters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How he had done his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So that their rivers were turned to blood, and they were not able to get drink from their streams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent different sorts of flies among them, poisoning their flesh; and frogs for their destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He gave the increase of their fields to worms, the fruits of their industry to the locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He sent ice for the destruction of their vines; their trees were damaged by the bitter cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He sent on them the heat of his wrath, his bitter disgust, letting loose evil angels among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He let his wrath have its way; he did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life to disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt; the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he took his people out like sheep, guiding them in the waste land like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He took them on safely so that they had no fear; but their haters were covered by the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he was their guide to his holy land, even to the mountain, which his right hand had made his;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Driving out nations before them, marking out the line of their heritage, and giving the people of Israel their tents for a resting-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But they were bitter against the Most High God, testing him, and not keeping his laws;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When this came to God's ears he was very angry, and gave up Israel completely;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh, the tent which he had put among men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Their young men were burned in the fire; and their virgins were not praised in the bride-song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests were put to death by the sword, and their widows made no weeping for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then was the Lord like one awaking from sleep, and like a strong man crying out because of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And he put the tent of Joseph on one side, and took not the tribe of Ephraim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he took the tribe of Judah for himself, and the mountain of Zion, in which he had pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he made his holy place like the high heaven, like the earth which is fixed by him for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From looking after the sheep which were giving milk, he took him to give food to Jacob his people, and to Israel his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he gave them food with an upright heart, guiding them by the wisdom of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
