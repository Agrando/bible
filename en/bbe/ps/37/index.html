Do not be angry because of the wrongdoers, or have envy of the workers of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For they will quickly be cut down like grass, and become dry like the green plants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Have faith in the Lord, and do good; be at rest in the land, and go after righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So will your delight be in the Lord, and he will give you your heart's desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Put your life in the hands of the Lord; have faith in him and he will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he will make your righteousness be seen like the light, and your cause like the shining of the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Take your rest in the Lord, waiting quietly for him; do not be angry because of the man who does well in his evil ways, and gives effect to his bad designs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Put an end to your wrath and be no longer bitter; do not give way to angry feeling which is a cause of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the evil-doers will be cut off: but those who have faith in the Lord will have the earth for their heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For in a short time the evil-doer will be gone: you will go searching for his place, and it will not be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the gentle will have the earth for their heritage; they will take their delight in peace without measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sinner has evil designs against the upright, lifting up the voice of wrath against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He will be laughed at by the Lord, who sees that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The evil-doers have taken out their swords, their bows are bent; for crushing the poor, and to put to death those who are upright in their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But their swords will be turned into their hearts, and their bows will be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The little which the good man has is better than the wealth of evil-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the evil-doers will be broken: but the Lord is the support of the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The days of the upright are numbered by the Lord, and their heritage will be for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They will not be shamed in the evil time, and in the days when all are in need of food they will have enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wrongdoers will come to destruction, and the haters of the Lord will be like the fat of lambs, they will be burned up; they will go up in smoke, and never again be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The sinner takes money and does not give it back; but the upright man has mercy, and gives to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Those who have his blessing will have the earth for their heritage; but those who are cursed by him will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he takes delight in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Even if he has a fall he will not be without help: for the hand of the Lord is supporting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old, but I have not seen the good man without help, or his children looking for bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day he is ready to have mercy and to give; his children are a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Be turned from evil, and do good; and your place will be for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Lord is a lover of righteousness, and takes care of his saints; they will be kept safe for ever; but the seed of the evil-doers will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The upright will have the earth for their heritage, and will go on living there for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the good man says words of wisdom; the talk of his tongue is of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God is in his heart; he will never make a false step.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The sinners are watching the upright man, desiring to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Lord will not give him into their hands, or be against him when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Be waiting for the Lord, and keep his way; and you will be lifted up, and have the land for your heritage: when the evil-doers are cut off, you will see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the evil-doer in great power, covering the earth like a great tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But he came to an end, and there was no sign of him; I made a search for him and he was not there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Give attention to the good man, and take note of the upright; because the end of that man is peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But as for the sinners, they will be cut off together; the end of the wrongdoers is destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the Lord is the saviour of the upright: he is their strength in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the Lord will be their help, and keep them safe: he will take them out of the hands of the evil-doers, and be their saviour, because they had faith in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
