give honour to his name, talking of his doings among the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let your voice be sounding in songs and melody; let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Have glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who are searching after the Lord be glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let your search be for the Lord and for his strength; let your hearts ever be turned to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Keep in mind the great works which he has done; his wonders, and the decisions of his mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O you seed of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob, his loved ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is the Lord our God: he is judge of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He has kept his agreement in mind for ever, the word which he gave for a thousand generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The agreement which he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he gave it to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an eternal agreement;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying, To you will I give the land of Canaan, the measured line of your heritage:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were still small in number, and strange in the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they went about from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He would not let anyone do them wrong; he even kept back kings because of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Saying, Put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil, and do my prophets no wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he took away all food from the land, so that the people were without bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was given as a servant for a price:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His feet were fixed in chains; his neck was put in iron bands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Till the time when his word came true; he was tested by the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king sent men to take off his chains; even the ruler of the people, who let him go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He made him lord of his house, and ruler over everything he had;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To give his chiefs teaching at his pleasure, and so that his law-givers might get wisdom from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob was living in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his people were greatly increased, and became stronger than those who were against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Their hearts were turned to hate against his people, so that they made secret designs against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, the man of his selection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He let his signs be seen among the people, and his wonders in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He sent black night and made it dark; and they did not go against his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At his word their waters were turned to blood, and he sent death on all their fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Their land was full of frogs, even in the rooms of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He gave the word, and there came the dog-fly, and insects over all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He gave them ice for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He gave their vines and their fig-trees to destruction, and the trees of their land were broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>At his word the locusts came, and young locusts more than might be numbered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And put an end to all the plants of their land, taking all the fruit of the earth for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He put to death the first child of every family in the land, the first-fruits of their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He took his people out with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Egypt was glad when they went; for the fear of them had come down on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A cloud was stretched over them for a cover; and he sent fire to give light in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>At the people's request he sent birds, and gave them the bread of heaven for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>His hand made the rock open, and the waters came streaming out; they went down through the dry places like a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he kept in mind his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he took his people out with joy, the men of his selection with glad cries:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And gave them the lands of the nations; and they took the work of the peoples for a heritage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So that they might keep his orders, and be true to his laws. Give praise to the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
