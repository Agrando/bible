Of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>\69:1\Be my saviour, O God; because the waters have come in, even to my neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>\69:2\My feet are deep in the soft earth, where there is no support; I have come into deep waters, the waves are flowing over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>\69:3\I am tired with my crying; my throat is burning: my eyes are wasted with waiting for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>\69:4\Those who have hate for me without cause are greater in number than the hairs of my head; those who are against me, falsely desiring my destruction, are very strong; I gave back what I had not taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>\69:5\O God, you see how foolish I am; and my wrongdoing is clear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>\69:6\Let not those who have hope in you be put to shame because of me, O Lord God of armies: let not those who are waiting for you be made low because of me, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>\69:7\I have been wounded with sharp words because of you; my face has been covered with shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>\69:8\I have become strange to my brothers, and like a man from a far country to my mother's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>\69:9\I am on fire with passion for your house; and the hard things which are said about you have come on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>\69:10\My bitter weeping, and my going without food, were turned to my shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>\69:11\When I put on the clothing of grief, they said evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>\69:12\I am a cause of wonder to those in authority; a song to those who are given to strong drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>\69:13\But as for me, let my prayer be made to you, O Lord, at a time when you are pleased; O God, give me an answer in your great mercy, for your salvation is certain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>\69:14\Take me from the grip of the sticky earth, so that I may not go down into it; let me be lifted up from the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>\69:15\Let me not be covered by the flowing waters; let not the deep waters go over my head, and let me not be shut up in the underworld.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>\69:16\Give an answer to my words, O Lord; for your mercy is good: be turned to me, because of your great pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>\69:17\Let not your face be covered from your servant, for I am in trouble; quickly give me an answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>\69:18\Come near to my soul, for its salvation: be my saviour, because of those who are against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>\69:19\You have seen my shame, how I was laughed at and made low; my haters are all before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>\69:20\My heart is broken by bitter words, I am full of grief; I made a search for some to have pity on me, but there was no one; I had no comforter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>\69:21\They gave me poison for my food; and bitter wine for my drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>\69:22\Let their table before them be for their destruction; let their feasts become a net to take them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>\69:23\Let their eyes be blind so that they may not see; let their bodies for ever be shaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>\69:24\Let your curse come on them; let the heat of your wrath overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>\69:25\Give their houses to destruction, and let there be no one in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>\69:26\Because they are cruel to him against whom your hand is turned; they make bitter the grief of him who is wounded by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>\69:27\Let their punishment be increased; let them not come into your righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>\69:28\Let their names be taken from the book of the living, let them not be numbered with the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>\69:29\But I am poor and full of sorrow; let me be lifted up by your salvation, O Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>\69:30\I will give praise to the name of God with a song; I will give glory to him for what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>\69:31\This will be more pleasing to the Lord than an ox, or a young ox of full growth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>\69:32\The poor will see it and be glad: you who are lovers of God, let your hearts have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>\69:33\For the ears of the Lord are open to the poor, and he takes thought for his prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>\69:34\Let the heavens and the earth give praise to him, the seas, and everything moving in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>\69:35\For God will be the saviour of Zion, and the builder of the towns of Judah; so that it may be their resting-place and heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>\69:36\The seed of his servants will have their part in it, and there the lovers of his name will have rest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
