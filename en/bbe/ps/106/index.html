O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who is able to give an account of the great acts of the Lord, or to make clear all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Happy are they whose decisions are upright, and he who does righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Keep me in mind, O Lord, when you are good to your people; O let your salvation come to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So that I may see the well-being of the people of your selection, and have a part in the joy of your nation, and take pride in your heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are sinners like our fathers, we have done wrong, our acts are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers did not give thought to your wonders in Egypt; they did not keep in memory the great number of your mercies, but gave you cause for wrath at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he was their saviour because of his name, so that men might see his great power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By his word the Red Sea was made dry: and he took them through the deep waters as through the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he took them safely out of the hands of their haters, and kept them from the attacks of those who were against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters went over their haters; all of them came to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they had faith in his words; they gave him songs of praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But their memory of his works was short; not waiting to be guided by him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They gave way to their evil desires in the waste land, and put God to the test in the dry places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave them their request, but sent a wasting disease into their souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They were full of envy against Moses among the tents, and against Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opening put an end to Dathan, covering up Abiram and his band.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was lighted among their tents; the sinners were burned up by the flames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a young ox in Horeb, and gave worship to an image of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And their glory was changed into the image of an ox, whose food is grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They had no memory of God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Works of wonder in the land of Ham, and things of fear by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he was purposing to put an end to them if Moses, his special servant, had not gone up before him, between him and his people, turning back his wrath, to keep them from destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They were disgusted with the good land; they had no belief in his word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Talking against him secretly in their tents, they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he made an oath against them, to put an end to them in the waste land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That their children might be mixed among the nations, and sent away into other lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they were joined to Baal-peor, and took part in the offerings to the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they made him angry by their behaviour; and he sent disease on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Phinehas got up, and made prayer for them; and the disease went no farther.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And all the generations coming after him kept the memory of his righteousness for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They made God angry again at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled because of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For they made his spirit bitter, and he said unwise things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not put an end to the peoples, as the Lord had said;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But they were joined to the nations, learning their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they gave worship to images; which were a danger to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And gave the blood of their sons and their daughters who had done no wrong, offering them to the images of Canaan; and the land was made unclean with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So they became unclean through their works, going after their evil desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then the wrath of the Lord was burning against his people, and he was angry with his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave them into the hands of the nations; and they were ruled by their haters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>By them they were crushed, and made low under their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Again and again he made them free; but their hearts were turned against his purpose, and they were overcome by their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But when their cry came to his ears, he had pity on their trouble:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And kept in mind his agreement with them, and in his great mercy gave them forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He put pity into the hearts of those who made them prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Be our saviour, O Lord our God, and let us come back together from among the nations, so that we may give honour to your holy name, and have glory in your praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Praise be to the Lord God of Israel for ever and for ever; and let all the people say, So be it. Give praise to the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
