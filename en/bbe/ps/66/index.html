A Song. A Psalm. Send up a glad cry to God, all the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Make a song in honour of his name: give praise and glory to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Say to God, How greatly to be feared are your works! because of your great power your haters are forced to put themselves under your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let all the earth give you worship, and make songs to you; let them make songs to your name. (Selah.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Come and see the works of God: he is to be feared in all he does to the children of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The sea was turned into dry land: they went through the river on foot: there did we have joy in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is ruling in power for ever; his eyes are watching the nations: may his haters have no strength against him. (Selah.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Give blessings to our God, O you peoples, let the voice of his praise be loud;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because he gives us life, and has not let our feet be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For you, O God, have put us to the test: testing us by fire like silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You let us be put in prison; chains were put on our legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You let men go driving over our heads; we went through fire and through water; but you took us out into a wide place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will come into your house with burned offerings, I will make payment of my debt to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Keeping the word which came from my lips, and which my mouth said, when I was in trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will give you burned offerings of fat beasts, and the smoke of sheep; I will make offerings of oxen and goats. (Selah.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come, give ear to me, all you God-fearing men, so that I may make clear to you what he has done for my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My voice went up to him, and I was lifted up from the underworld.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I said in my heart, The Lord will not give ear to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But truly God's ear has been open; he has give attention to the voice of my prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Praise be to God who has not taken away his good faith and his mercy from me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
