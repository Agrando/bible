Give orders and teaching about these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any man gives different teaching, not in agreement with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the teaching which is in agreement with true religion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He has an over-high opinion of himself; being without knowledge, having only an unhealthy love of questionings and wars of words, from which come envy, fighting, cruel words, evil thoughts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Bitter talk of men who, being evil in mind and dead to what is true, take the faith to be a way of making profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But true faith, with peace of mind, is of great profit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we came into the world with nothing, and we are not able to take anything out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if we have food and a roof over us, let that be enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But those who have a desire for wealth are falling into danger, and are taken as in a net by a number of foolish and damaging desires, through which men are overtaken by death and destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is a root of all evil: and some whose hearts were fixed on it have been turned away from the faith, and been wounded with unnumbered sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you, O man of God, keep yourself from these things, and go after righteousness, religion, faith, love, a quiet mind, gentle behaviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be fighting the good fight of the faith; take for yourself the life eternal, for which you were marked out, and of which you gave witness in the eyes of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I give you orders before God, the giver of life, and Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate gave witness to the faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>To keep the word untouched by evil, clear from all shame, till the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Which at the right time he will make clear, who is the eternal and only Ruler, King of kings, and Lord of lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who only has life for ever, living in light to which no man may come near; whom no man has seen or is able to see: to whom be honour and power for ever.
