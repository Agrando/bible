So be it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This order I give to you, Timothy my son, in harmony with the words of the prophets about you, so that by them you may be strong, fighting the good fight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Keeping faith, and being conscious of well-doing; for some, by not doing these things, have gone wrong in relation to the faith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have given up to Satan, so that they may say no more evil words against God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
