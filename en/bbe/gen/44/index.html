So he did as Joseph said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And at dawn the men, with their asses, were sent away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they had gone only a little way out of the town, Joseph said to the servant who was over his house, Go after them; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you done evil in reward for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future? Truly, you have done evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he overtook them and said these words to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said to him, Why does my lord say such words as these? far be it from your servants to do such a thing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>See, the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from Canaan: how then might we take silver or gold from your lord's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If it comes to light that any of your servants has done this, let him be put to death, and we will be your lord's servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Let it be as you say: he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant; and you will not be responsible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he made a search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was in Benjamin's bag.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was still there: and they went down on their faces before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said, What is this thing which you have done? had you no thought that such a man as I would have power to see what is secret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What are we to say to my lord? how may we put ourselves right in his eyes? God has made clear the sin of your servants: now we are in your hands, we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he said, Far be it from me to do so: but the man who had my cup will be my servant; and you may go back to your father in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near him, and said, Let your servant say a word in my lord's ears, and let not your wrath be burning against your servant: for you are in the place of Pharaoh to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord said to his servants, Have you a father or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child, whom he had when he was old; his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother, and is very dear to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you said to your servants, Let him come down to me with you, so that I may see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said to my lord, His father will not let him go; for if he went away his father would come to his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But you said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come with you, you will not see my face again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when we went back to your servant, our father, we gave him an account of my lord's words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go again and get us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, Only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down; for we may not see the man's face again if our youngest brother is not with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And our father said to us, You have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The one went away from me, and I said, Truly he has come to a violent death; and from that time I have not seen him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If now you take this one from me, and some evil comes to him, you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If then I go back to your servant, my father, without the boy, because his life and the boy's life are one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When he sees that the boy is not with us, he will come to his death, and our father's grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I made myself responsible for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So now let me be my lord's servant here in place of the boy, and let him go back with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how may I go back to my father without the boy, and see the evil which will come on my father?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
