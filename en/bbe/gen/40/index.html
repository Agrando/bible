And Joseph said, Does not the sense of dreams come from God? what was your dream?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the chief wine-servant gave Joseph an account of his dream, and said, In my dream I saw a vine before me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the vine were three branches; and it seemed as if it put out buds and flowers, and from them came grapes ready for cutting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and crushing them into Pharaoh's cup, gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three branches are three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After three days Pharaoh will give you honour, and put you back into your place, and you will give him his cup as you did before, when you were his wine-servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But keep me in mind when things go well for you, and be good to me and say a good word for me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For truly I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews; and I have done nothing for which I might be put in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now when the chief bread-maker saw that the first dream had a good sense, he said to Joseph, I had a dream; and in my dream there were three baskets of white bread on my head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the top basket were all sorts of cooked meats for Pharaoh; and the birds were taking them out of the baskets on my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three baskets are three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After three days Pharaoh will take you out of prison, hanging you on a tree, so that your flesh will be food for birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his servants; and he gave honour to the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker among the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he put the chief wine-servant back in his old place; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the chief bread-maker was put to death by hanging, as Joseph had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the wine-servant did not keep Joseph in mind or give a thought to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
