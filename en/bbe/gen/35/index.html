and Jacob put them away under the holy tree at Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they went on their journey: and the fear of God was on the towns round about, so that they made no attack on the sons of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan (which is the same as Beth-el), he and all his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there he made an altar, naming the place El-beth-el: because it was there he had the vision of God when he was in flight from his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Deborah, the servant who had taken care of Rebekah from her birth, came to her end, and was put to rest near Beth-el, under the holy tree: and they gave it the name of Allon-bacuth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when Jacob was on his way from Paddan-aram, God came to him again and, blessing him, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jacob is your name, but it will be so no longer; from now your name will be Israel; so he was named Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God said to him, I am God, the Ruler of all: be fertile, and have increase; a nation, truly a group of nations, will come from you, and kings will be your offspring;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you; and to your seed after you I will give the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then God went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with God, and put a drink offering on it, and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave to the place where God had been talking with him, the name of Beth-el.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they went on from Beth-el; and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, the pains of birth came on Rachel and she had a hard time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when her pain was very great, the woman who was helping her said, Have no fear; for now you will have another son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in the hour when her life went from her (for death came to her), she gave the child the name Ben-oni: but his father gave him the name of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to Ephrath (which is Beth-lehem).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob put up a pillar on her resting-place; which is named, The Pillar of the resting-place of Rachel, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now while they were living in that country, Reuben had connection with Bilhah, his father's servant-woman: and Israel had news of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now Jacob had twelve sons: the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first son, and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher; these are the sons whom Jacob had in Paddan-aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had been living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Isaac was a hundred and eighty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Isaac came to his end and was put to rest with his father's people, an old man after a long life: and Jacob and Esau, his sons, put him in his last resting-place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
