So Tamar went back to her father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after a time, Bath-shua, Judah's wife, came to her end; and after Judah was comforted for her loss, he went to Timnah, where they were cutting the wool of his sheep, and his friend Hirah of Adullam went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Tamar had news that her father-in-law was going up to Timnah to the wool-cutting,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She took off her widow's clothing, and covering herself with her veil, she took her seat near Enaim on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was now a man, but she had not been made his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town, because her face was covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And turning to her by the roadside, he said to her, Let me come in to you; for he had no idea that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me as my price?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I will give you a young goat from the flock. And she said, What will you give me as a sign till you send it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, What would you have? And she said, Your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand. So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she became with child by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widow's clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat, to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman: but she was not there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he put questions to the men of the place, saying, Where is the loose woman who was in Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There was no such woman there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So he went back to Judah, and said, I have not seen her, and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah said, Let her keep the things, so that we may not be shamed; I sent the young goat, but you did not see the woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now about three months after this, word came to Judah that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had been acting like a loose woman and was with child. And Judah said, Take her out and let her be burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And while she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law, saying, The man whose property these things are, is the father of my child: say then, whose are this ring and this cord and this stick?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Judah said openly that they were his, and said, She is more upright than I am, for I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he had no more connection with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the time came for her to give birth, it was clear that there were two children in her body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And while she was in the act of giving birth, one of them put out his hand; and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand, saying, This one came out first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But then he took his hand back again, and his brother came first to birth: and the woman said, What an opening you have made for yourself! So he was named Perez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then his brother came out, with the red thread round his hand, and he was named Zerah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
