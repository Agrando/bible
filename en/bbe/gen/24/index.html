is there room in your father's house for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, Nahor's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she said, We have a great store of dry grass and cattle-food, and there is room for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And with bent head the man gave worship to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master, by guiding me straight to the house of my master's family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mother's house</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he came out quickly to the man at the water-spring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when he saw the nose-ring and the ornaments on his sister's hands, and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her, then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water-spring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Come in, you on whom is the blessing of the Lord; why are you waiting outside? for I have made the house ready for you, and a place for the camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the man came into the house, and Laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food, and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And meat was put before him, but he said, I will not take food till I have made my business clear to you. And they said, Do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I am Abraham's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Lord has given my master every blessing, and he has become great: he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and men-servants and women-servants and camels and asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when Sarah, my master's wife, was old, she gave birth to a son, to whom he has given all he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And my master made me take an oath, saying, Do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But go to my father's house and to my relations for a wife for my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I said to my master, What if the woman will not come with me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said, The Lord, whom I have ever kept before me, will send his angel with you, who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my father's house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from your oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I came today to the water-spring, and I said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Let it come about that, while I am waiting here by the water-spring, if a girl comes to get water and I say to her, Give me a little water from your vessel, and she says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels; let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my master's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And even while I was saying this to myself, Rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm; and she went down to the spring to get water; and I said to her, Give me a drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And straight away she took down her vessel from her arm, and said, Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And questioning her, I said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, and Milcah his wife. Then I put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, by whom I had been guided in the right way, to get the daughter of my master's brother for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And now, say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not, in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer, This is the Lord's doing: it is not for us to say Yes or No to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>See, here is Rebekah: take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the Lord has said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And at these words, Abraham's servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah: and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then he and the men who were with him had food and drink, and took their rest there that night; and in the morning he got up, and said, Let me now go back to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But her brother and her mother said, Let the girl be with us a week or ten days, and then she may go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And he said, Do not keep me; the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey; let me now go back to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they sent for Rebekah and said to her, Are you ready to go with this man? And she said, I am ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abraham's servant and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they gave Rebekah their blessing, saying, O sister, may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands; and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>So Rebekah and her servant-women went with the man, seated on the camels; and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the South.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And when the evening was near, he went wandering out into the fields, and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And when Rebekah, looking up, saw Isaac, she got down from her camel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And said to the servant, Who is that man coming to us through the field? And the servant said, It is my master: then she took her veil, covering her face with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Then the servant gave Isaac the story of all he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Isaac took Rebekah into his tent and she became his wife; and in his love for her, Isaac was comforted after his father's death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
