And we had to give him answers; how were we to have any idea that he would say, Come back with your brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>\43:8\Then Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and let us be up and going, so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>\43:9\Put him into my care and make me responsible for him: if I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>\43:10\Truly, if we had not let the time go by, we might have come back again by now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>\43:11\Then their father Israel said to them, If it has to be so, then do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man, perfumes and honey and spices and nuts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>\43:12\And take twice as much money with you; that is to say, take back the money which was put in your bags, for it may have been an error;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>\43:13\And take your brother and go back to the man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>\43:14\And may God, the Ruler of all, give you mercy before the man, so that he may give you back your other brother and Benjamin. If my children are to be taken from me; there is no help for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>\43:15\So they took what their father said for the man, and twice as much money in their hands, and Benjamin, and went on their journey to Egypt, and came before Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>\43:16\And when Joseph saw Benjamin, he said to his chief servant, Take these men into my house, and make ready a meal, for they will take food with me in the middle of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>\43:17\And the servant did as Joseph said, and took the men into Joseph's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>\43:18\Now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into Joseph's house and they said, It is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time; he is looking for something against us, so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>\43:19\So they went up to Joseph's chief servant at the door of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>\43:20\And said, O my lord, we only came down the first time to get food;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>\43:21\And when we came to our night's resting-place, on opening our bags we saw that every man's money was in the mouth of his bag, all our money in full weight: and we have it with us to give it back;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>\43:22\As well as more money, with which to get food: we have no idea who put our money in our bags.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>\43:23\Then the servant said, Peace be with you: have no fear: your God, even the God of your father, has put wealth in your bags for you: I had your money. Then he let Simeon come out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>\43:24\And the servant took them into Joseph's house, and gave them water for washing their feet; and he gave their asses food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>\43:25\And they got ready the things for Joseph before he came in the middle of the day: for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>\43:26\And when Joseph came in, they gave him the things which they had for him, and went down to the earth before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>\43:27\And he said, How are you? is your father well, the old man of whom you were talking to me? is he still living?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>\43:28\And they said, Your servant, our father, is well, he is still living. And they went down on their faces before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>\43:29\Then, lifting up his eyes, he saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and he said, Is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word? And he said, God be good to you, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>\43:30\Then Joseph's heart went out to his brother, and he went quickly into his room, for he was overcome with weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>\43:31\Then, after washing his face, he came out, and controlling his feelings said, Put food before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>\43:32\And they put a meal ready for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who were with him by themselves; because the Egyptians may not take food with the Hebrews, for that would make them unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>\43:33\And they were all given their seats before him in order of birth, from the oldest to the youngest: so that they were looking at one another in wonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>\43:34\And Joseph sent food to them from his table, but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others. And they took wine freely with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
