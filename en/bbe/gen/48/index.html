And he said, Let them come near me, and I will give them a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now because Israel was old, his eyes were no longer clear, and he was not able to see. So he made them come near to him, and he gave them a kiss, folding them in his arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Israel said to Joseph, I had no hope of seeing your face again, but God in his mercy has let me see you and your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Joseph took them from between his knees, and went down on his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then taking Ephraim with his right hand, Joseph put him at Israel's left side, and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Israel's right side, placing them near him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Israel, stretching out his right hand, put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands on purpose, for Manasseh was the older.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave Joseph a blessing, saying, May the God to whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, gave worship, the God who has taken care of me all my life till this day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The angel who has been my saviour from all evil, send his blessing on these children: and let my name and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, be given to them; and let them become a great nation in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now when Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it did not seem right to him; and lifting his father's hand he would have put it on the head of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the older; put your right hand on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But his father would not, saying, I am doing it on purpose, my son; he will certainly become a nation and a great one; but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a great family of nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So he gave them his blessing that day, saying, You will be the sign of blessing in Israel, for they will say, May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh; and he put Ephraim before Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Israel said to Joseph, Now my death is near; but God will be with you, guiding you back to the land of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I have given you more than your brothers, even Shechem as your heritage, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
