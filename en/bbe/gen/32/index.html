For he said to himself, I will take away his wrath by the offering which I have sent on, and then I will come before him: it may be that I will have grace in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the servants with the offerings went on in front, and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in the night he got up, and taking with him his two wives and the two servant-women and his eleven children, he went over the river Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He took them and sent them over the stream with all he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jacob was by himself; and a man was fighting with him till dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob, he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg, so that his leg was damaged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him, Let me go now, for the dawn is near. But Jacob said, I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel: for in your fight with God and with men you have overcome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Jacob said, What is your name? And he said, What is my name to you? Then he gave him a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob gave that place the name of Peniel, saying, I have seen God face to face, and still I am living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And while he was going past Peniel, the sun came up. And he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For this reason the children of Israel, even today, never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food, because the hollow of Jacob's leg was touched.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
