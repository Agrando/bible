You have done to me things which are not to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said to Abraham, Why did you do this thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abraham said, Because it seemed to me that there was no fear of God in this place, and that they might put me to death because of my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, in fact, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when God sent me wandering from my father's house, I said to her, Let this be the sign of your love for me; wherever we go, say of me, He is my brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Abimelech gave to Abraham sheep and oxen and men-servants and women-servants, and gave him back his wife Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Abimelech said, See, all my land is before you; take whatever place seems good to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said to Sarah, See, I have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right; now your honour is clear in the eyes of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Abraham made prayer to God, and God made Abimelech well again, and his wife and his women-servants, so that they had children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the Lord had kept all the women of the house of Abimelech from having children, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
