At that time, the Canaanites were still living in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord came to Abram, and said, I will give all this land to your seed; then Abram made an altar there to the Lord who had let himself be seen by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And moving on from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, he put up his tent, having Beth-el on the west and Ai on the east: and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he went on, journeying still to the South.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And because there was little food to be had in that land, he went down into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now when he came near to Egypt, he said to Sarai, his wife, Truly, you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I am certain that when the men of Egypt see you, they will say, This is his wife: and they will put me to death and keep you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Say, then, that you are my sister, and so it will be well with me because of you, and my life will be kept safe on your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And so it was that when Abram came into Egypt, the men of Egypt, looking on the woman, saw that she was fair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pharaoh's great men, having seen her, said words in praise of her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And because of her, he was good to Abram, and he had sheep and oxen and asses, and men-servants and women-servants, and camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Lord sent great troubles on Pharaoh's house because of Sarai, Abram's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Pharaoh sent for Abram, and said, What have you done to me? why did you not say that she was your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why did you say that she was your sister? so that I took her for my wife: now, take your wife and go on your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pharaoh gave orders to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and all he had.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
