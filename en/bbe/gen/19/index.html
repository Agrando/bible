And they said, Not so, but we will take our night's rest in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But he made his request more strongly, so they went with him into his house; and he got food ready for them, and made unleavened bread, of which they took.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But before they had gone to bed, the men of the town, all the men of Sodom, came round the house, young and old, from every part of the town;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And crying out to Lot, they said, Where are the men who came to your house this night? Send them out to us, so that we may take our pleasure with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Lot went out to them in the doorway, shutting the door after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, My brothers, do not this evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>See now, I have two unmarried daughters; I will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you: only do nothing to these men, for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said, Give way there. This one man, they said, came here from a strange country, and will he now be our judge? now we will do worse to you than to them; and pushing violently against Lot, they came near to get the door broken in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the men put out their hands and took Lot into the house to them, shutting the door again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the men who were outside the door they made blind, all of them, small and great, so that they were tired out with looking for the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the men said to Lot, Are there any others of your family here? sons-in-law or sons or daughters, take them all out of this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For we are about to send destruction on this place, because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the Lord; and the Lord has sent us to put an end to the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, Come, let us go out of this place, for the Lord is about to send destruction on the town. But his sons-in-law did not take him seriously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when morning came, the angels did all in their power to make Lot go, saying, Get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here, and go, for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But while he was waiting, the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand, for the Lord had mercy on them, and put them outside the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they had put them out, he said, Go for your life, without looking back or waiting in the lowland; go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Lot said to them, Not so, O my Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>See now, your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction, but I am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This town, now, is near, and it is a little one: O, let me go there (is it not a little one?) so that my life may be safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, See, I have given you your request in this one thing more: I will not send destruction on this town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Go there quickly, for I am not able to do anything till you have come there. For this reason, the town was named Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sun was up when Lot came to Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he sent destruction on those towns, with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Lot's wife, looking back, became a pillar of salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And looking in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the lowland, he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So it came about that when God sent destruction on the towns of the lowland, he kept his word to Abraham, and sent Lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Lot went up out of Zoar to the mountain, and was living there with his two daughters, for fear kept him from living in Zoar: and he and his daughters made their living-place in a hole in the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the older daughter said to her sister, Our father is old, and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Come, let us give our father much wine, and we will go into his bed, so that we may have offspring by our father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And that night they made their father take much wine; and the older daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And on the day after, the older daughter said to the younger, Last night I was with my father; let us make him take much wine this night again, and do you go to him, so that we may have offspring by our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And that night again they made their father take much wine; and the younger daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And so the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the older daughter had a son, and she gave him the name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the younger had a son and gave him the name Ben-ammi: from him come the children of Ammon to this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
