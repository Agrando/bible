And Rachel said to her, Let me have some of your son's love-fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Leah said to her, Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me? and now would you take my son's love-fruits? Then Rachel said, You may have him tonight in exchange for your son's love-fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the evening, when Jacob came in from the field, Leah went out to him and said, Tonight you are to come to me, for I have given my son's love-fruits as a price for you. And he went in to her that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God gave ear to her and she became with child, and gave Jacob a fifth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Leah said, God has made payment to me for giving my servant-girl to my husband: so she gave her son the name Issachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And again Leah became with child, and she gave Jacob a sixth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she said, God has given me a good bride-price; now at last will I have my husband living with me, for I have given him six sons: and she gave him the name Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After that she had a daughter, to whom she gave the name Dinah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then God gave thought to Rachel, and hearing her prayer he made her fertile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she was with child, and gave birth to a son: and she said, God has taken away my shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she gave him the name Joseph, saying, May the Lord give me another son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now after the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Let me go away to my place and my country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have been your servant, and let me go: for you have knowledge of all the work I have done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Laban said, If you will let me say so, do not go away; for I have seen by the signs that the Lord has been good to me because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say then what your payment is to be and I will give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Jacob said, You have seen what I have done for you, and how your cattle have done well under my care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For before I came you had little, and it has been greatly increased; and the Lord has given you a blessing in everything I have done; but when am I to do something for my family?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Laban said, What am I to give you? And Jacob said, Do not give me anything; but I will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let me go through all your flock today, taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black, and all the marked or coloured goats: these will be my payment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come; if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured, or any sheep which is not black, you may take me for a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Laban said, Let it be as you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So that day he took all the he-goats which were banded or coloured, and all the she-goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And sent them three days' journey away: and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Jacob took young branches of trees, cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he put the banded sticks in the drinking-places where the flock came to get water; and they became with young when they came to the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And because of this, the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>These lambs Jacob kept separate; and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with Laban's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young, Jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking-places, so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put the sticks before them; so that the feebler flocks were Laban's and the stronger were Jacob's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So Jacob's wealth was greatly increased; he had great flocks and women-servants and men-servants and camels and asses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
