And he said, Nothing; but even so, send me back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God sent another trouble-maker, Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had gone in flight from his lord, Hadadezer, king of Zobah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He got some men together and made himself captain of a band of outlaws; and went to Damascus and became king there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was a trouble to Israel all through the days of Solomon. And this is the damage Hadad did: he was cruel to Israel while he was ruler over Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there was Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was Zeruah, a widow; and his hand was lifted up against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The way in which his hand came to be lifted up against the king was this: Solomon was building the Millo and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jeroboam was an able and responsible man; and Solomon saw that he was a good worker and made him overseer of all the work given to the sons of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now at that time, when Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite came across him on the road; now Ahijah had put on a new robe; and the two of them were by themselves in the open country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahijah took his new robe in his hands, parting it violently into twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to Jeroboam, Take ten of the parts, for this is what the Lord has said: See, I will take the kingdom away from Solomon by force, and will give ten tribes to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(But one tribe will be his, because of my servant David, and because of Jerusalem, the town which, out of all the tribes of Israel, I have made mine,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because they are turned away from me to the worship of Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Chemosh, the god of Moab, and Milcom, the god of the Ammonites; they have not been walking in my ways or doing what is right in my eyes or keeping my laws and my decisions as his father David did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I will not take the kingdom from him; I will let him be king all the days of his life, because of David my servant, in whom I took delight because he kept my orders and my laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But I will take the kingdom from his son, and give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one tribe I will give to his son, so that David my servant may have a light for ever burning before me in Jerusalem, the town which I have made mine to put my name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And you I will take, and you will be king over Israel, ruling over whatever is the desire of your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if you give attention to the orders I give you, walking in my ways and doing what is right in my eyes and keeping my laws and my orders as David my servant did; then I will be with you, building up for you a safe house, as I did for David, and I will give Israel to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>(So that I may send trouble for this on the seed of David, but not for ever.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Solomon was looking for a chance to put Jeroboam to death; but he went in flight to Egypt, to Shishak, king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all he did, and his wisdom, are they not recorded in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the time Solomon was king in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David his father: and Solomon went to rest with his fathers and Rehoboam his son became king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
