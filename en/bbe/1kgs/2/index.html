And she said, Come you in peace? And he said, Yes, in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he said, I have something to say to you. And she said, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, You saw how the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had the idea that I would be their king; but now the kingdom is turned about, and has become my brother's, for it was given to him by the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now I have one request to make to you, and do not say, No, to me. And she said to him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he said, Will you go to Solomon the king (for he will not say, No, to you) and put before him my request that he will give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bath-sheba said, Good! I will make your request to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Bath-sheba went to King Solomon to have talk with him on Adonijah's account. And the king got up to come to her, and went down low to the earth before her; then he took his place on the king's seat and had a seat made ready for the king's mother and she took her place at his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then she said, I have one small request to make to you; do not say, No, to me. And the king said, Say on, my mother, for I will not say, No, to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then King Solomon made answer and said to his mother, Why are you requesting me to give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah? Take the kingdom for him in addition, for he is my older brother, and Abiathar the priest and Joab, the son of Zeruiah, are on his side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then King Solomon took an oath by the Lord, saying, May God's punishment be on me if Adonijah does not give payment for these words with his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now by the living Lord, who has given me my place on the seat of David my father, and made me one of a line of kings, as he gave me his word, truly Adonijah will be put to death this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And King Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and he made an attack on him and put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth, to your fields; for death would be your right reward; but I will not put you to death now, because you took up the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and you were with him in all his troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Solomon let Abiathar be priest no longer, so that he might make the word of the Lord come true which he said about the sons of Eli in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And news of this came to Joab; for Joab had been one of Adonijah's supporters, though he had not been on Absalom's side. Then Joab went in flight to the Tent of the Lord, and put his hands on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they said to King Solomon, Joab has gone in flight to the Tent of the Lord and is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, make an attack on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Benaiah came to the Tent of the Lord and said to him, The king says, Come out. And he said, No; but let death come to me here. And Benaiah went back to the king and gave him word of the answer which Joab had given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king said, Do as he has said and make an attack on him there, and put his body into the earth; so that you may take away from me and from my family the blood of one put to death by Joab without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the Lord will send back his blood on his head, because of the attack he made on two men more upright and better than himself, putting them to the sword without my father's knowledge; even Abner, the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So their blood will be on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed for ever; but for David and his seed and his family and the seat of his kingdom, there will be peace for ever from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up, and falling on him, put him to death; and his body was put to rest in his house in the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the king put Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, in his place over the army; and Zadok the priest he put in the place of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the king sent for Shimei, and said to him, Make a house for yourself in Jerusalem and keep there and go to no other place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For be certain that on the day when you go out and go over the stream Kidron, death will overtake you: and your blood will be on your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Shimei said to the king, Very well! as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And for a long time Shimei went on living in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But after three years, two of the servants of Shimei went in flight to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And word was given to Shimei that his servants had gone to Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then Shimei got up, and making ready his ass, he went to Gath, to Achish, in search of his servants; and he sent and got them from Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And news was given to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then the king sent for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make you take an oath by the Lord, protesting to you and saying, Be certain that on the day when you go out from here, wherever you go, death will overtake you? and you said to me, Very well!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord and the order which I gave you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the king said to Shimei, You have knowledge of all the evil which you did to David my father; and now the Lord has sent back your evil on yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But a blessing will be on King Solomon, and the kingdom of David will keep its place before the Lord for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So the king gave orders to Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and, falling on him, put him to death. And Solomon's authority over the kingdom was complete.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
