But the first said, No; the dead child is your son and the living one mine. So they kept on talking before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the king said, One says, The living child is my son, and yours is the dead: and the other says, Not so; but your son is the dead one and mine is the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said, Get me a sword. So they went and put a sword before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said, Let the living child be cut in two and one half given to one woman and one to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the mother of the living child came forward, for her heart went out to her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the child; do not on any account put it to death. But the other woman said, It will not be mine or yours; let it be cut in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the king made answer and said, Give her the child, and do not put it to death; she is the mother of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And news of this decision which the king had made went through all Israel; and they had fear of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to give decisions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
