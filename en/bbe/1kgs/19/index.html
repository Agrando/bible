So he took food and drink and went to sleep again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel of the Lord came again a second time, and touching him said, Get up and have some food, or the journey will be overmuch for your strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So he got up and took food and drink, and in the strength of that food he went on for forty days and nights, to Horeb, the mountain of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there he went into a hole in the rock for the night; then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, What are you doing here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have made destruction of your altars, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the only one living; and now they are attempting to take away my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he said, Go out and take your place on the mountain before the Lord. Then the Lord went by, and mountains were parted by the force of a great wind, and rocks were broken before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind there was an earth-shock, but the Lord was not in the earth-shock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after the earth-shock a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, the sound of a soft breath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elijah, hearing it, went out, covering his face with his robe, and took his place in the opening of the hole. And there a voice came to him saying, What are you doing here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have had your altars broken down, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the only one living; and now they are attempting to take away my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord said to him, Go back on your way through the waste land to Damascus; and when you come there, put the holy oil on Hazael to make him king over Aram;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And on Jehu, son of Nimshi, making him king over Israel; and on Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, to be prophet in your place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it will come about that the man who gets away safe from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will put to death; and whoever gets away safe from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I will keep safe seven thousand in Israel, all those whose knees have not been bent to Baal, and whose mouths have given him no kisses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he went away from there and came across Elisha, the son of Shaphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen, he himself walking with the twelfth; and Elijah went up to him and put his robe on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And letting the oxen be where they were, he came running after Elijah, and said, Only let me give a kiss to my father and mother, and then I will come after you. But he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he went back, and took the oxen and put them to death, and cooking their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, he gave the people a feast. Then he got up and went after Elijah and became his servant.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
