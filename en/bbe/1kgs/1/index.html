And he said, What is your desire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said to him, My lord, you took an oath by the Lord your God and gave your word to your servant, saying, Truly, Solomon your son will be king after me, seated on the seat of my kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now, see, Adonijah has made himself king without my lord's knowledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers, and has sent for all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the captain of the army; but he has not sent for Solomon your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, waiting for you to say who is to take the place of my lord the king after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as things are, it will come about, when my lord the king is sleeping with his fathers, that I and Solomon my son will be made outlaws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they said to the king, Here is Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he went down on his face on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Nathan said, O my lord king, have you said, Adonijah is to be king after me, seated on the seat of my kingdom?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because today he has gone down and has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers, and has sent for all the king's sons to come to him, with the captains of the army and Abiathar the priest; and they are feasting before him and crying, Long life to King Adonijah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, he has not sent for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Has this thing been done by my lord the king, without giving word to your servants who was to be placed on my lord the king's seat after him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then King David in answer said, Send for Bath-sheba to come to me. And she came in and took her place before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king took an oath, and said, By the living Lord, who has been my saviour from all my troubles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As I took an oath to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, Certainly Solomon your son will become king after me, seated on my seat in my place; so will I do this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Bath-sheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour, and said, May my lord King David go on living for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And King David said, Send for Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and put Solomon my son on my beast, yes, mine, and take him down to Gihon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And there let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him to make him king over Israel; and sounding the horn say, Long life to King Solomon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then come up after him and he will come in and take his place on the seat of my kingdom; for he is to be king in my place, and I have given orders that he is to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answering the king, said, So be it: and may the Lord, the God of my lord the king, say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As the Lord has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon and make the seat of his authority greater than that of my lord King David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down and put Solomon on King David's beast and took him to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Zadok the priest took the vessel of oil out of the Tent, and put the holy oil on Solomon. And when the horn was sounded, all the people said, Long life to King Solomon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the people came up after him, piping with pipes, and they were glad with great joy, so that the earth was shaking with the sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to the ears of Adonijah and all the guests who were with him, when their meal was ended. And Joab, hearing the sound of the horn, said, What is the reason of this noise as if the town was worked up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And while the words were on his lips, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, came; and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a man of good faith and the news which you have for us will be good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jonathan, answering, said to Adonijah, Not so, but our lord King David has made Solomon king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they put him on the king's beast:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him and made him king in Gihon; and they came back from there with joy, and the town was all worked up. This is the noise which has come to your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And now Solomon is seated on the seat of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And the king's servants came to our lord King David, blessing him and saying, May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and the seat of his authority greater than your seat; and the king was bent low in worship on his bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the king said, May the God of Israel be praised, who has given one of my seed to be king in my place this day and has let my eyes see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all the guests of Adonijah got up in fear and went away, every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Adonijah himself was full of fear because of Solomon; and he got up and went to the altar, and put his hands on its horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And they gave Solomon word of it, saying, See, Adonijah goes in such fear of King Solomon, that he has put his hands on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon first give me his oath that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Solomon said, If he is seen to be a man of good faith, not a hair of him will be touched; but if any wrongdoing is seen in him, he is to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So King Solomon sent, and they took him down from the altar. And he came and gave honour to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
