and he had a great name among all the nations round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He was the maker of three thousand wise sayings, and of songs to the number of a thousand and five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He made sayings about all plants, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop hanging on the wall; and about all beasts and birds and fishes and the small things of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>People came from every nation to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had word of his wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
