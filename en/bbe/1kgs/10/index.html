So she went back to her country, she and her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In addition to what came to him from the business of the traders, and from all the kings of the Arabians, and from the rulers of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Solomon made two hundred body-covers of hammered gold, every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he made three hundred smaller body-covers of hammered gold, with three pounds of gold in every cover: and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king made a great ivory seat, plated with the best gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There were six steps going up to it, and the top of it was round at the back, there were arms on the two sides of the seat, and two lions by the side of the arms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And twelve lions were placed on the one side and on the other side on the six steps: there was nothing like it in any kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all King Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold; not one was of silver, for no one gave a thought to silver in the days of King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the king had Tarshish-ships at sea with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the Tarshish-ships came with gold and silver and ivory and monkeys and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And from all over the earth they came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And everyone took with him an offering, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and robes, and coats of metal, and spices, and horses, and beasts of transport, regularly year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Solomon got together war-carriages and horsemen; he had one thousand, four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore-trees of the lowlands in number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Solomon's horses came from Egypt and from Kue; the king's traders got them at a price from Kue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A war-carriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
