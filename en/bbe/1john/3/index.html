For this reason the world does not see who we are, because it did not see who he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>My loved ones, now we are children of God, and at present it is not clear what we are to be. We are certain that at his revelation we will be like him; for we will see him as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy, even as he is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone who is a sinner goes against the law, for sin is going against the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you have knowledge that he came to take away sin: and in him there is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Anyone who is in him does no sin; anyone who is a sinner has not seen him and has no knowledge of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My little children, let no man take you out of the true way: he who does righteousness is upright, even as he is upright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sinner is a child of the Evil One; for the Evil One has been a sinner from the first. And the Son of God was seen on earth so that he might put an end to the works of the Evil One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Anyone who is a child of God does no sin, because he still has God's seed in him; he is not able to be a sinner, because God is his Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this way it is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the Evil One; anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother, is not a child of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because this is the word which was given to you from the first, that we are to have love for one another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not being of the Evil One like Cain, who put his brother to death. And why did he put him to death? Because his works were evil and his brother's works were good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world has no love for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We are conscious that we have come out of death into life because of our love for the brothers. He who has no love is still in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Anyone who has hate for his brother is a taker of life, and you may be certain that no taker of life has eternal life in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In this we see what love is, because he gave his life for us; and it is right for us to give our lives for the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if a man has this world's goods, and sees that his brother is in need, and keeps his heart shut against his brother, how is it possible for the love of God to be in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My little children, do not let our love be in word and in tongue, but let it be in act and in good faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In this way we may be certain that we are true, and may give our heart comfort before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When our heart says that we have done wrong; because God is greater than our heart, and has knowledge of all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My loved ones, if our heart does not say that we have done wrong, we have no fear before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he gives us all our requests, because we keep his laws and do the things which are pleasing in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his law, that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love for one another, even as he said to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who keeps his laws is in God and God is in him. And the Spirit which he gave us is our witness that he is in us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
