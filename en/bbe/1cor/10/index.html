We are free to do all things, but not all things are for the common good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let a man give attention not only to what is good for himself, but equally to his neighbour's good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whatever meat may be had at the public market, take as food without question of right or wrong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the earth is the Lord's and all things in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If a Gentile makes a feast for you, and you are pleased to go as a guest, take whatever is put before you, without question of right or wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if anyone says to you, This food has been used as an offering, do not take it, on account of him who said it, and on account of his sense of right and wrong:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Right and wrong, I say, not for you, but for the other man; for the fact that I am free is not dependent on another man's sense of right or wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if I give praise to God for the food which I take, let no man say evil of me for that reason.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, if it is a question of food or drink, or any other thing, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Give no cause of trouble to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Even as I give way to all men in all things, not looking for profit for myself, but for the good of others, that they may get salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
