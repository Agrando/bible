What am I to say to you? am I to give you praise? certainly not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For it was handed down to me from the Lord, as I gave it to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when Judas was false to him, took bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when it had been broken with an act of praise, he said, This is my body which is for you: do this in memory of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way, with the cup, after the meal, he said, This cup is the new testament in my blood: do this, whenever you take it, in memory of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the Lord's death till he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If, then, anyone takes the bread or the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit, he will be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For a man puts himself in danger, if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the Lord's body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause a number of you are feeble and ill, and a number are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we were true judges of ourselves, punishment would not come on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if punishment does come, it is sent by the Lord, so that we may be safe when the world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then, my brothers, when you come together to the holy meal of the Lord, let there be waiting for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If any man is in need of food, let him take his meal in his house; so that you may not come together to your damage. And the rest I will put in order when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
