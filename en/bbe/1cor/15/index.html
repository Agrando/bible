But when he says, All things are put under him, it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when all things have been put under him, then will the Son himself be under him who put all things under him, so that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Again, what will they do who are given baptism for the dead? if the dead do not come back at all, why are people given baptism for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why are we in danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yes, truly, by your pride in me, my brothers in Christ Jesus our Lord, my life is one long death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If, after the way of men, I was fighting with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead do not come to life again, let us take our pleasure in feasting, for tomorrow we come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be tricked by false words: evil company does damage to good behaviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I say this to put you to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will say, How do the dead come back? and with what sort of body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Foolish man, it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when you put it into the earth, you do not put in the body which it will be, but only the seed, of grain or some other sort of plant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives it a body, as it is pleasing to him, and to every seed its special body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, and another of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there are bodies of heaven and bodies of earth, but the glory of the one is different from that of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for the glory of one star is different from that of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So is it with the coming back from the dead. It is planted in death; it comes again in life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is planted in shame; it comes again in glory: feeble when it is planted, it comes again in power:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is planted a natural body; it comes again as a body of the spirit. If there is a natural body, there is equally a body of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And so it is said, The first man Adam was a living soul. The last Adam is a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But that which is natural comes before that which is of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man is from the earth, and of the earth: the second man is from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Those who are of the earth are like the man who was from the earth: and those who are of heaven are like the one from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And in the same way as we have taken on us the image of the man from the earth, so we will take on us the image of the one from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now I say this, my brothers, that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God; and death may not have a part in life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>See, I am giving you the revelation of a secret: we will not all come to the sleep of death, but we will all be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>In a second, in the shutting of an eye, at the sound of the last horn: for at that sound the dead will come again, free for ever from the power of death, and we will be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this body which comes to destruction will be made free from the power of death, and the man who is under the power of death will put on eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But when this has taken place, then that which was said in the Writings will come true, Death is overcome by life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O death, where is your power? O death, where are your pains?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The pain of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But praise be to God who gives us strength to overcome through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For this cause, my dear brothers, be strong in purpose and unmoved, ever giving yourselves to the work of the Lord, because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
