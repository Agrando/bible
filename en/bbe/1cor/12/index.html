if all was hearing, where would be the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has put every one of the parts in the body as it was pleasing to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they were all one part, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now they are all different parts, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye may not say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No, those parts which seem to be feeble are the more necessary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And to those parts of the body which seem to have less honour we give all the more honour; and to those parts of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater respect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But those parts of the body which are beautiful have no need of such care: and so the body has been joined together by God in such a way as to give more honour to those parts which had need of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So that there might be no division in the body; but all the parts might have the same care for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if there is pain in one part of the body, all the parts will be feeling it; or if one part is honoured, all the parts will be glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and every one of you the separate parts of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God has put some in the church, first, Apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then those with wonder-working powers, then those with the power of taking away disease, helpers, wise guides, users of strange tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all Apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? have all the power of working wonders?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Are all able to take away disease? have all the power of tongues? are all able to give their sense?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the Spirit. And now I am pointing out to you an even better way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
