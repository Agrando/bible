They are but servants who gave you the good news as God gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God gave the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then the planter is nothing, and the waterer is nothing; but God who gives the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end: but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are workers with God: you are God's planting, God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the measure of the grace given to me, I, as a wise master-builder, have put the base in position, and another goes on building on it. But let every man take care what he puts on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But on the base a man may put gold, silver, stones of great price, wood, dry grass, cut stems;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Every man's work will be made clear in that day, because it will be tested by fire; and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every man's work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man's work comes through the test, he will have a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If the fire puts an end to any man's work, it will be his loss: but he will get salvation himself, though as by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not see that you are God's holy house, and that the Spirit of God has his place in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone makes the house of God unclean, God will put an end to him; for the house of God is holy, and you are his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man have a false idea. If any man seems to himself to be wise among you, let him become foolish, so that he may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolish before God. As it is said in the holy Writings, He who takes the wise in their secret designs:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again, The Lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise, that they are nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So let no one take pride in men. For all things are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
