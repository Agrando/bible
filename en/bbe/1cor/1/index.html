was Paul nailed to the cross for you? or were you given baptism in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I give praise to God that not one of you had baptism from me, but Crispus and Gaius;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So that no one may be able to say that you had baptism in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I gave baptism to the house of Stephanas; but I am not certain that any others had baptism from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ sent me, not to give baptism, but to be a preacher of the good news: not with wise words, for fear that the cross of Christ might be made of no value.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the word of the cross seems foolish to those who are on the way to destruction; but to us who are on the way to salvation it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As it says in the holy Writings, I will put an end to the wisdom of the wise, and will put on one side the designs of those who have knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? where is he who has knowledge of the law? where is the man of this world who has a love of discussion? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For because, by the purpose of God, the world, with all its wisdom, had not the knowledge of God, it was God's pleasure, by so foolish a thing as preaching, to give salvation to those who had faith in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seeing that the Jews make request for signs, and the Greeks are looking for knowledge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But we give the good news of Christ on the cross, a hard thing to the Jews, and a foolish thing to the Gentiles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to those of God's selection, Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because what seems foolish in God is wiser than men; and what seems feeble in God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you see God's design for you, my brothers, that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh, not the strong, not the noble:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God made selection of the foolish things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame; and the feeble things that he might put to shame the strong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the low things of the world, and the things without honour, did God make selection of, yes, even the things which are not, so that he might make as nothing the things which are:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So that no flesh might have glory before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God has given you a place in Christ Jesus, through whom God has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation, and made us holy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that, as it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
