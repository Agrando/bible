But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me: for I am looking for him with the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But as for Apollos, the brother, I had a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not his pleasure to come now; but he will come when he has a chance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be on the watch, unmoved in the faith, and be strong like men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let all you do be done in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now I make my request to you, my brothers, for you have knowledge that the house of Stephanas is the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have made themselves the servants of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That you put yourselves under such, and under everyone who is helping the Lord's work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for they have done what was needed to make your work complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For they gave comfort to my spirit and to yours: for which cause give respect to such people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The churches of Asia send their love to you.
