but through knowledge the upright are taken out of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When things go well for the upright man, all the town is glad; at the death of sinners, there are cries of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By the blessing of the upright man the town is made great, but it is overturned by the mouth of the evil-doer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has a poor opinion of his neighbour has no sense, but a wise man keeps quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who goes about talking of others makes secrets public, but the true-hearted man keeps things covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When there is no helping suggestion the people will have a fall, but with a number of wise guides they will be safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who makes himself responsible for a strange man will undergo much loss; but the hater of such undertakings will be safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A woman who is full of grace is honoured, but a woman hating righteousness is a seat of shame: those hating work will undergo loss, but the strong keep their wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The man who has mercy will be rewarded, but the cruel man is the cause of trouble to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The sinner gets the payment of deceit; but his reward is certain who puts in the seed of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So righteousness gives life; but he who goes after evil gets death for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The uncontrolled are hated by the Lord, but those whose ways are without error are his delight</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Certainly the evil-doer will not go free from punishment, but the seed of the upright man will be safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Like a ring of gold in the nose of a pig, is a beautiful woman who has no sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The desire of the upright man is only for good, but wrath is waiting for the evil-doer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A man may give freely, and still his wealth will be increased; and another may keep back more than is right, but only comes to be in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who gives blessing will be made fat, but the curser will himself be cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who keeps back grain will be cursed by the people; but a blessing will be on the head of him who lets them have it for a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who, with all his heart, goes after what is good is searching for grace; but he who is looking for trouble will get it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He who puts his faith in wealth will come to nothing; but the upright man will be full of growth like the green leaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The troubler of his house will have the wind for his heritage, and the foolish will be servant to the wise-hearted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The fruit of righteousness is a tree of life, but violent behaviour takes away souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If the upright man is rewarded on earth, how much more the evil-doer and the sinner!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
