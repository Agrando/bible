let them be hanging round your neck, recorded on your heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So you will have grace and a good name in the eyes of God and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Put all your hope in God, not looking to your reason for support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all your ways give ear to him, and he will make straight your footsteps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Put no high value on your wisdom: let the fear of the Lord be before you, and keep yourself from evil:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This will give strength to your flesh, and new life to your bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Give honour to the Lord with your wealth, and with the first-fruits of all your increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My son, do not make your heart hard against the Lord's teaching; do not be made angry by his training:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For to those who are dear to him the Lord says sharp words, and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Happy is the man who makes discovery of wisdom, and he who gets knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For trading in it is better than trading in silver, and its profit greater than bright gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She is of more value than jewels, and nothing for which you may have a desire is fair in comparison with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Long life is in her right hand, and in her left are wealth and honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Her ways are ways of delight, and all her goings are peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She is a tree of life to all who take her in their hands, and happy is everyone who keeps her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord by wisdom put in position the bases of the earth; by reason he put the heavens in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By his knowledge the deep was parted, and dew came dropping from the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, keep good sense, and do not let wise purpose go from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they will be life for your soul, and grace for your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then you will go safely on your way, and your feet will have no cause for slipping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When you take your rest you will have no fear, and on your bed sleep will be sweet to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have no fear of sudden danger, or of the storm which will come on evil-doers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the Lord will be your hope, and will keep your foot from being taken in the net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not keep back good from those who have a right to it, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say not to your neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it by you at the time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Do not make evil designs against your neighbour, when he is living with you without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do not take up a cause at law against a man for nothing, if he has done you no wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Have no envy of the violent man, or take any of his ways as an example.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the wrong-hearted man is hated by the Lord, but he is a friend to the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The curse of the Lord is on the house of the evil-doer, but his blessing is on the tent of the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He makes sport of the men of pride, but he gives grace to the gentle-hearted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The wise will have glory for their heritage, but shame will be the reward of the foolish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
