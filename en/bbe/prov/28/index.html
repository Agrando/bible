but by a man of wisdom and knowledge they will be put out like a fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A man of wealth who is cruel to the poor is like a violent rain causing destruction of food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those who have no respect for the law give praise to the evil-doer; but such as keep the law are against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Evil men have no knowledge of what is right; but those who go after the Lord have knowledge of all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better is the poor man whose ways are upright, than the man of wealth whose ways are not straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who keeps the law is a wise son, but he who keeps company with feasters puts shame on his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who makes his wealth greater by taking interest, only gets it together for him who has pity on the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As for the man whose ear is turned away from hearing the law, even his prayer is disgusting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Anyone causing the upright to go wandering in an evil way, will himself go down into the hole he has made; but the upright will have good things for their heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The man of wealth seems to himself to be wise, but the poor man who has sense has a low opinion of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the upright do well, there is great glory; but when evil-doers are lifted up, men do not let themselves be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who keeps his sins secret will not do well; but one who is open about them, and gives them up, will get mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Happy is the man in whom is the fear of the Lord at all times; but he whose heart is hard will come into trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Like a loud-voiced lion and a wandering bear, is an evil ruler over a poor people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The prince who has no sense is a cruel ruler; but he who has no desire to get profit for himself will have long life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One who has been the cause of a man's death will go in flight to the underworld: let no man give him help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He whose ways are upright will be safe, but sudden will be the fall of him whose ways are twisted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By ploughing his land a man will have bread in full measure; but he who goes after good-for-nothing persons will be poor enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A man of good faith will have great blessing, but one attempting to get wealth quickly will not go free from punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is not good to have respect for a man's position: for a man will do wrong for a bit of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He who is ever desiring wealth goes running after money, and does not see that need will come on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who says words of protest to a man will later have more approval than one who says smooth words with his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who takes from his father or his mother what is theirs by right, and says, It is no sin; is the same as a taker of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who is ever desiring profit is a cause of fighting; but he who puts his faith in the Lord will be made fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He whose faith is in himself is foolish; but everyone walking wisely will be kept safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who gives to the poor will never be in need, but great curses will be on him who gives no attention to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When evil-doers are lifted up, men take cover; but when destruction overtakes them, the upright are increased.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
