but one who is over-quick in acting will only come to be in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who gets stores of wealth by a false tongue, is going after what is only breath, and searching for death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By their violent acts the evil-doers will be pulled away, because they have no desire to do what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Twisted is the way of him who is full of crime; but as for him whose heart is clean, his work is upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It is better to be living in an angle of the house-top, than with a bitter-tongued woman in a wide house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The desire of the evil-doer is fixed on evil: he has no kind feeling for his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the man of pride undergoes punishment, the simple man gets wisdom; and by watching the wise he gets knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Upright One, looking on the house of the evil-doer, lets sinners be overturned to their destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He whose ears are stopped at the cry of the poor, will himself get no answer to his cry for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>By a secret offering wrath is turned away, and the heat of angry feelings by money in the folds of the robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It is a joy to the good man to do right, but it is destruction to the workers of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The wanderer from the way of knowledge will have his resting-place among the shades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The lover of pleasure will be a poor man: the lover of wine and oil will not get wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The evil-doer will be given as a price for the life of the good man, and the worker of deceit in the place of the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is better to be living in a waste land, than with a bitter-tongued and angry woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There is a store of great value in the house of the wise, but it is wasted by the foolish man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who goes after righteousness and mercy will get life, righteousness, and honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A wise man goes up into the town of the strong ones, and overcomes its strength in which they put their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who keeps watch over his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The man of pride, lifted up in soul, is named high-hearted; he is acting in an outburst of pride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The desire of the hater of work is death to him, for his hands will do no work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day the sinner goes after his desire: but the upright man gives freely, keeping nothing back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The offering of evil-doers is disgusting: how much more when they give it with an evil purpose!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A false witness will be cut off, ...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The evil-doer makes his face hard, but as for the upright, he gives thought to his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Wisdom and knowledge and wise suggestions are of no use against the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The horse is made ready for the day of war, but power to overcome is from the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
