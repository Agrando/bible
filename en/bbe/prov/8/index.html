my voice comes to the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Become expert in reason, O you simple ones; you foolish ones, take training to heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Give ear, for my words are true, and my lips are open to give out what is upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For good faith goes out of my mouth, and false lips are disgusting to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the words of my mouth are righteousness; there is nothing false or twisted in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They are all true to him whose mind is awake, and straightforward to those who get knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take my teaching, and not silver; get knowledge in place of the best gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For wisdom is better than jewels, and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I, wisdom, have made wise behaviour my near relation; I am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The fear of the Lord is seen in hating evil: pride, a high opinion of oneself, the evil way, and the false tongue, are unpleasing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wise design and good sense are mine; reason and strength are mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Through me kings have their power, and rulers give right decisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Through me chiefs have authority, and the noble ones are judging in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Those who have given me their love are loved by me, and those who make search for me with care will get me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wealth and honour are in my hands, even wealth without equal and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My fruit is better than gold, even than the best gold; and my increase is more to be desired than silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I go in the road of righteousness, in the way of right judging:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that I may give my lovers wealth for their heritage, making their store-houses full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Lord made me as the start of his way, the first of his works in the past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>From eternal days I was given my place, from the birth of time, before the earth was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When there was no deep I was given birth, when there were no fountains flowing with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Before the mountains were put in their places, before the hills was my birth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he made ready the heavens I was there: when he put an arch over the face of the deep:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he made strong the skies overhead: when the fountains of the deep were fixed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he put a limit to the sea, so that the waters might not go against his word: when he put in position the bases of the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then I was by his side, as a master workman: and I was his delight from day to day, playing before him at all times;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Playing in his earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Give ear to me then, my sons: for happy are those who keep my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take my teaching and be wise; do not let it go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Happy is the man who gives ear to me, watching at my doors day by day, keeping his place by the pillars of my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever gets me gets life, and grace from the Lord will come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But he who does evil to me, does wrong to his soul: all my haters are in love with death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
