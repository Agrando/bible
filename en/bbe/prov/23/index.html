it is gone: for wealth takes to itself wings, like an eagle in flight up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not take the food of him who has an evil eye, or have any desire for his delicate meat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For as the thoughts of his heart are, so is he: Take food and drink, he says to you; but his heart is not with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The food which you have taken will come up again, and your pleasing words will be wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Say nothing in the hearing of a foolish man, for he will put no value on the wisdom of your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not let the landmark of the widow be moved, and do not go into the fields of those who have no father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For their saviour is strong, and he will take up their cause against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Give your heart to teaching, and your ears to the words of knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not keep back training from the child: for even if you give him blows with the rod, it will not be death to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Give him blows with the rod, and keep his soul safe from the underworld.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My son, if your heart becomes wise, I, even I, will be glad in heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And my thoughts in me will be full of joy when your lips say right things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have no envy of sinners in your heart, but keep in the fear of the Lord all through the day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For without doubt there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Give ear, my son, and be wise, guiding your heart in the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not be among those who give themselves to wine-drinking, or among those who make themselves full with meat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For those who take delight in drink and feasting will come to be in need; and through love of sleep a man will be poorly clothed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Give ear to your father whose child you are, and do not keep honour from your mother when she is old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Get for yourself that which is true, and do not let it go for money; get wisdom and teaching and good sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The father of the upright man will be glad, and he who has a wise child will have joy because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let your father and your mother be glad, let her who gave you birth have joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes take delight in my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For a loose woman is a deep hollow, and a strange woman is a narrow water-hole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yes, she is waiting secretly like a beast for its food, and deceit by her is increased among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who says, Oh! who says, Ah! who has violent arguments, who has grief, who has wounds without cause, whose eyes are dark?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Those who are seated late over the wine: those who go looking for mixed wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Keep your eyes from looking on the wine when it is red, when its colour is bright in the cup, when it goes smoothly down:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In the end, its bite is like that of a snake, its wound like the wound of a poison-snake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Your eyes will see strange things, and you will say twisted things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yes, you will be like him who takes his rest on the sea, or on the top of a sail-support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They have overcome me, you will say, and I have no pain; they gave me blows without my feeling them: when will I be awake from my wine?
