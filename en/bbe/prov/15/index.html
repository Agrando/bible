but from the mouth of the foolish comes a stream of foolish words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A comforting tongue is a tree of life, but a twisted tongue is a crushing of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A foolish man puts no value on his father's training; but he who has respect for teaching has good sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the house of the upright man there is a great store of wealth; but in the profits of the sinner there is trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lips of the wise keep knowledge, but the heart of the foolish man is not right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The offering of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright man is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The way of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but he who goes after righteousness is dear to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There is bitter punishment for him who is turned from the way; and death will be the fate of the hater of teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Before the Lord are the underworld and destruction: how much more, then, the hearts of the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The hater of authority has no love for teaching: he will not go to the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A glad heart makes a shining face, but by the sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The heart of the man of good sense goes in search of knowledge, but foolish things are the food of the unwise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All the days of the troubled are evil; but he whose heart is glad has an unending feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great wealth together with trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Better is a simple meal where love is, than a fat ox and hate with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>An angry man makes men come to blows, but he who is slow to get angry puts an end to fighting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thorns are round the way of the hater of work; but the road of the hard worker becomes a highway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish man has no respect for his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Foolish behaviour is joy to the unwise; but a man of good sense makes his way straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Where there are no wise suggestions, purposes come to nothing; but by a number of wise guides they are made certain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man has joy in the answer of his mouth: and a word at the right time, how good it is!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Acting wisely is the way of life, guiding a man away from the underworld.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The house of the man of pride will be uprooted by the Lord, but he will make safe the heritage of the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Evil designs are disgusting to the Lord, but the words of the clean-hearted are pleasing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He whose desires are fixed on profit is a cause of trouble to his family; but he who has no desire for offerings will have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The heart of the upright gives thought to his answer; but from the mouth of the evil-doer comes a stream of evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Lord is far from sinners, but his ear is open to the prayer of the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The light of the eyes is a joy to the heart, and good news makes the bones fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The man whose ear is open to the teaching of life will have his place among the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who will not be controlled by training has no respect for his soul, but he who gives ear to teaching will get wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The fear of the Lord is the teaching of wisdom;
