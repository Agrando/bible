For great trouble will come on the land, and wrath on this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they will be put to death with the sword, and will be taken as prisoners into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be crushed under the feet of the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles are complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and on the earth, fear among the nations and doubt because of the loud noise of the sea and the waves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men's strength will go from them in fear and in waiting for the things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of the heavens will be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when these things come about, let your heads be lifted up, because your salvation is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he made a story for them: See the fig-tree, and all the trees;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When they put out their young leaves, you take note of it, and it is clear to you that summer is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the same way, when you see these things taking place you may be certain that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Truly I say to you, This generation will not come to an end till all things are complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Heaven and earth will come to an end, but my words will not come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But give attention to yourselves, for fear that your hearts become over-full of the pleasures of food and wine, and the cares of this life, and that day may come on you suddenly, and take you as in a net:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For so it will come on all those who are living on the face of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But keep watch at all times with prayer, that you may be strong enough to come through all these things and take your place before the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And every day he was teaching in the Temple and every night he went out to the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives to take his rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And all the people came early in the morning to give ear to his words in the Temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
