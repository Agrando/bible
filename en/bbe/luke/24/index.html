And they said, The things to do with Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, great in his acts and his words, before God and all the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we were hoping that he would be the Saviour of Israel. In addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And certain women among us gave us cause for wonder, for they went early to the place where his body had been put,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it was not there; then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some of those who were with us went to the place, and saw that it was as the women had said, but him they did not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said, O foolish men! how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Was it not necessary for the Christ to go through these things, and to come into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he made clear to them all the things in the Writings, from Moses and from all the prophets, which had to do with himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came near the town to which they were going, and he seemed as if he was going on;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they kept him back, saying, Do not go, for evening is near, the day is almost gone. And he went in with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when he was seated with them at table, he took the bread, and said words of blessing and, making division of it, he gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And then their eyes were open, and they had knowledge of him, but he went from their view.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said to one another, Were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way, making clear to us the holy Writings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And that very hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem, where the eleven and the others had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said to them, The Lord has truly come back to life again, and Simon has seen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way, and how, when he gave them bread, they had knowledge of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And while they were saying these things, he himself was among them, and said to them, Peace be with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were full of fear, being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, Why are you troubled, and why are your hearts full of doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See; my hands and my feet: it is I myself; put your hands on me and make certain; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And because, for joy and wonder, they were still in doubt, he said to them, Have you any food here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave him a bit of cooked fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And before their eyes he took a meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said to them, These are the words which I said to you when I was still with you, how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms about me, to be put into effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he made the holy Writings clear to their minds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them, So it is in the Writings that the Christ would undergo death, and come back to life again on the third day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to Jerusalem first and to all nations in his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And now I will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you, but do not go from the town, till the power from heaven comes to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he took them out till they were near Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he gave them a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And while he was doing so, he went from them and was taken up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they gave him worship and went back to Jerusalem with great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they were in the Temple at all times, giving praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
