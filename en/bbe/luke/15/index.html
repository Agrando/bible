And he made division of his goods between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And not long after, the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a far-away country, and there all his money went in foolish living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when everything was gone, there was no food to be had in that country, and he was in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country, and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And so great was his need that he would have been glad to take the pigs' food, and no one gave him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when he came to his senses, he said, What numbers of my father's servants have bread enough, and more, while I am near to death here through need of food!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have done wrong, against heaven and in your eyes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am no longer good enough to be named your son: make me like one of your servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he got up and went to his father. But while he was still far away, his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his son said to him, Father, I have done wrong, against heaven and in your eyes: I am no longer good enough to be named your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, Get out the first robe quickly, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And get the fat young ox and put it to death, and let us have a feast, and be glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this, my son, who was dead, is living again; he had gone away from me, and has come back. And they were full of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now the older son was in the field: and when he came near the house, the sounds of music and dancing came to his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he sent for one of the servants, questioning him about what it might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has had the young ox put to death because he has come back safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was angry and would not go in; and his father came out and made a request to him to come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he made answer and said to his father, See, all these years I have been your servant, doing your orders in everything: and you never gave me even a young goat so that I might have a feast with my friends:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when this your son came, who has been wasting your property with bad women, you put to death the fat young ox for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Son, you are with me at all times, and all I have is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But it was right to be glad and to have a feast; for this your brother, who was dead, is living again; he had gone away and has come back.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
