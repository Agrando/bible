And, while they were going, they were made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was clean, turning back, gave praise to God in a loud voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, falling down on his face at the feet of Jesus, he gave the credit to him; and he was a man of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus said, Were there not ten men who were made clean? where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Have not any of them come back to give glory to God, but only this one from a strange land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Get up, and go on your way; your faith has made you well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the Pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of God would come, he gave them an answer and said, The kingdom of God will not come through observation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And men will not say, See, it is here! or, There! for the kingdom of God is among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples, The time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but you will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if they say to you, See, it is there! or, It is here! do not go away, or go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as in a thunderstorm the bright light is seen from one end of the sky to the other, so will the Son of man be when his time comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first, he will have to undergo much and be put on one side by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the day of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were feasting and taking wives and getting married, till the day of the overflowing of the waters, when Noah went into the ark, and they all came to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In the same way, in the days of Lot; they were feasting and trading, they were planting and building;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But on the day when Lot went out of Sodom, fire came down from heaven and destruction came on them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So will it be in the day of the revelation of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On that day, if anyone is on the roof of the house, and his goods are in the house, let him not go down to take them away; and let him who is in the field not go back to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Keep in mind Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If anyone makes an attempt to keep his life, it will be taken from him, but if anyone gives up his life, he will keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I say to you, In that night there will be two men sleeping in one bed, and one will be taken away and the other let go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two women will be crushing grain together; one will be taken away and the other let go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they, answering him, said, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body is, there will the eagles come together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
