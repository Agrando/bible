I will send my dearly loved son; they may give respect to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the workmen saw him, they said to one another, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property: let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And driving him out of the garden they put him to death. Now what will the lord do to these workmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others. And when he said this, they said, May it not be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he, looking on them, said, Is it not in the Writings, The stone which the builders put on one side, the same has become the chief stone of the building?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Everyone falling on that stone will be broken, but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour; and they were in fear of the people, for they saw that he had made up this story against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they kept watch on him, and sent out secret representatives, who were acting the part of good men, in order that they might get something from his words, on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they put a question to him, saying, Master, we are certain that your teaching and your words are right, and that you have no respect for a man's position, but you are teaching the true way of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it right for us to make payment of taxes to Caesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he saw through their trick and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let me see a penny. Whose image and name are on it? And they said, Caesar's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said, Then give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were not able to get anything from these words before the people: but they were full of wonder at his answer, and said nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And some of the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no coming back from the dead; and they said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Master, Moses said that if a man's brother comes to his end, having a wife, but no children, his brother is to take the wife, and get a family for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there were seven brothers, and the first had a wife and came to his end, having no children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the second;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the third took her; and in the same way, all the seven, without having any children, came to their end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And last of all, the woman came to her end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for all the seven had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world are married and have wives;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But those to whom is given the reward of the world to come, and to come back from the dead, have no wives, and are not married;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And death has no more power over them, for they are equal to the angels, and are sons of God, being of those who will come back from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But even Moses made it clear that the dead come back to life, saying, in the story of the burning thorn-tree, The Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all men are living to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the scribes, in answer to this, said, Master, you have said well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they had fear of putting any more questions to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said to them, Why do they say that the Christ is the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Take your seat at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Till I put under your feet all those who are against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David then gives him the name of Lord, so how is it possible for him to be his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Keep away from the scribes, whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes, and to have words of respect said to them in the market-places, and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers; they will get a greater punishment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
