You had knowledge that I am a hard man, taking up what I have not put down and getting in grain where I have not put seed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Why then did you not put my money in a bank, so that when I came I would get it back with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to the others who were near, Take the pound away from him, and give it to the man who has ten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they say to him, Lord, he has ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I say to you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as for those who were against me, who would not have me for their ruler, let them come here, and be put to death before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had said this, he went on in front of them, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came about that when he got near Beth-phage and Bethany by the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Saying, Go into the little town in front of you, and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose and take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if anyone says to you, Why are you taking him? say, The Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And those whom he sent went away, and it was as he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they were getting the young ass, the owners of it said to them, Why are you taking the young ass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they took him to Jesus, and they put their clothing on the ass, and Jesus got on to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when he came near the foot of the Mountain of Olives, all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to God with joy, because of all the great works which they had seen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Saying, A blessing on the King who comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven and glory in the highest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees among the people said to him, Master, make your disciples be quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said in answer, I say to you, if these men keep quiet, the very stones will be crying out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he got near and saw the town, he was overcome with weeping for it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, If you, even you, had knowledge today, of the things which give peace! but you are not able to see them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you, and come all round you and keep you in on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And will make you level with the earth, and your children with you; and there will not be one stone resting on another in you, because you did not see that it was your day of mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he went into the Temple and put out those who were trading there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Saying to them, It has been said, My house is to be a house of prayer, but you have made it a hole of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And every day he was teaching in the Temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But they were not able to do anything, because the people all kept near him, being greatly interested in his words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
