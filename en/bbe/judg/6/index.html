And where are all his works of power, of which our fathers have given us word, saying, Did not the Lord take us out of Egypt? But now he has given us up, handing us over to the power of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord, turning to him, said, Go in the strength you have and be Israel's saviour from Midian: have I not sent you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to him, O Lord, how may I be the saviour of Israel? See, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the Lord said to him, Truly, I will be with you, and you will overcome the Midianites as if they were one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he said to him, If now I have grace in your eyes, then give me a sign that it is you who are talking to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not go away till I come with my offering and put it before you. And he said, I will not go away before you come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Gideon went in and made ready a young goat, and with an ephah of meal he made unleavened cakes: he put the meat in a basket and the soup in which it had been cooked he put in a pot, and he took it out to him under the oak-tree and gave it to him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the angel of God said to him, Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them down on the rock over there, draining out the soup over them. And he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the angel of the Lord put out the stick which was in his hand, touching the meat and the cakes with the end of it; and a flame came up out of the rock, burning up the meat and the cakes: and the angel of the Lord was seen no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Gideon was certain that he was the angel of the Lord; and Gideon said, I am in fear, O Lord God! for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the Lord said to him, Peace be with you; have no fear: you are in no danger of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Gideon made an altar there to the Lord, and gave it the name Yahweh-shalom; to this day it is in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The same night the Lord said to him, Take ten men of your servants and an ox seven years old, and after pulling down the altar of Baal which is your father's, and cutting down the holy tree by its side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Make an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered way and take the ox and make a burned offering with the wood of the holy tree which has been cut down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had said to him; but fearing to do it by day, because of his father's people and the men of the town, he did it by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the men of the town got up early in the morning, and they saw the altar of Baal broken down, and the holy tree which was by it cut down, and the ox offered on the altar which had been put up there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And after searching with care, they said, Gideon, the son of Joash, has done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the men of the town said to Joash, Make your son come out to be put to death, for pulling down the altar of Baal and cutting down the holy tree which was by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Joash said to all those who were attacking him, Will you take up the cause of Baal? will you be his saviour? Let anyone who will take up his cause be put to death while it is still morning: if he is a god, let him take up his cause himself because of the pulling down of his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So that day he gave him the name of Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal take up his cause against him because his altar has been broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east, banding themselves together, went over and put up their tents in the valley of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the spirit of the Lord came on Gideon; and at the sound of his horn all Abiezer came together after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sent through all Manasseh, and they came after him; and he sent to Asher and Zebulun and Naphtali, and they came up and were joined to the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Gideon said to God, If you are going to give Israel salvation by my hand, as you have said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>See, I will put the wool of a sheep on the grain-floor; if there is dew on the wool only, while all the earth is dry, then I will be certain that it is your purpose to give Israel salvation by my hand as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it was so: for he got up early on the morning after, and twisting the wool in his hands, he got a basin full of water from the dew on the wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Gideon said to God, Do not be moved to wrath against me if I say only this: let me make one more test with the wool; let the wool now be dry, while the earth is covered with dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And that night God did so; for the wool was dry, and there was dew on all the earth round it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
