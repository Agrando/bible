And they said sharp and angry words to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said to them, What have I done in comparison with you? Is not that which Ephraim took up after the grape-cutting better than all the grapes which Abiezer got in from the grape-cutting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God has given into your hands the chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you? And when he said this, their feeling about him became kinder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Gideon came to Jordan and went over it with his three hundred, overcome with weariness and in need of food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to the men of Succoth, Give bread cakes to my people, for they are overcome with weariness, and I am going on after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the chiefs of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Gideon said, Because of this, when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will have you stretched on a bed of thorns of the waste land and on sharp stems, and have you crushed as grain is crushed on a grain-floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So he went up from there to Penuel and made the same request to the men of Penuel; but they gave him the same answer as the men of Succoth had given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he said to the men of Penuel, When I come back in peace, I will have this tower broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, those of all the army of the children of the east who were still living; for a hundred and twenty thousand of their swordsmen had been put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Gideon went up by the way used by the people living in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and made an attack on the army when they had no thought of danger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Zebah and Zalmunna went in flight; and he went after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and put all the army to the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Gideon, the son of Joash, went back from the fight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And taking prisoner a young man of the people of Succoth, he got from him, in answer to his questions, a list of the chiefs of Succoth and the responsible men, seventy-seven men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he came to the men of Succoth and said, Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, on account of whom you made sport of me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand, that we are to give bread to your army who are overcome with weariness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he took the responsible men of the town and had them crushed on a bed of thorns and sharp stems.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he had the tower of Penuel broken down and the men of the town put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, Where are the men whom you put to death at Tabor? And they gave answer, As you are, so were they; every one of them was like a king's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, They were my brothers, my mother's sons: by the life of the Lord, if you had kept them safe, I would not put you to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he said to Jether, his oldest son, Up! Put them to death. But the boy did not take out his sword, fearing because he was still a boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Up! Put an end to us yourself: for you have a man's strength. Then Gideon got up and put Zebah and Zalmunna to death and took the ornaments which were on their camels' necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Be our ruler, you and your son and your son's son after him; for you have been our saviour from the hands of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Gideon said to them, I will not be a ruler over you, and my son will not be a ruler over you: it is the Lord who will be ruler over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Gideon said to them, I have a request to make to you; let every man give me the ear-rings he has taken. (For they had gold ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they gave answer, We will gladly give them. So they put down a robe, every man dropping into it the ear-rings he had taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The weight of the gold ear-rings which he got from them was one thousand, seven hundred shekels of gold; in addition to the moon-ornaments and jewels and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and the chains on their camels' necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Gideon made an ephod from them and put it up in his town Ophrah; and all Israel went after it there and were false to the Lord; and it became a cause of sin to Gideon and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Midian was broken before the children of Israel and the Midianites never got back their strength. And the land had peace for forty years, in the days of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went back to his house and was living there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Gideon had seventy sons, the offspring of his body; for he had a number of wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the servant-wife he had in Shechem had a son by him, to whom he gave the name Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Gideon, the son of Joash, came to his end when he was very old, and his body was put in the resting-place of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after the death of Gideon, the children of Israel again went after the gods of Canaan and were false to the Lord, and made Baal-berith their god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the children of Israel did not keep in their minds the Lord their God, who had been their saviour from all their haters on every side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they were not kind to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in reward for all the good he had done to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
