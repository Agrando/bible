And he said, Let there be quiet. Then all those who were waiting before him went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Ehud came in to him while he was seated by himself in his summer-house. And Ehud said, I have a word from God for you. And he got up from his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right side, and sent it into his stomach;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hand-part went in after the blade, and the fat was joined up over the blade; for he did not take the sword out of his stomach. And he went out into the ...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went out into the covered way, shutting the doors of the summer-house on him and locking them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when he had gone, the king's servants came, and saw that the doors of the summer-house were locked; and they said, It may be that he is in his summer-house for a private purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they went on waiting till they were shamed, but the doors were still shut; so they took the key, and, opening them, saw their lord stretched out dead on the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Ehud had got away while they were waiting and had gone past the stone images and got away to Seirah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he came there, he had a horn sounded in the hill-country of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he at their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, Come after me; for the Lord has given the Moabites, your haters, into your hands. So they went down after him and took the crossing-places of Jordan against Moab, and let no one go across.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At that time they put about ten thousand men of Moab to the sword, every strong man and every man of war; not a man got away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was broken that day under the hand of Israel. And for eighty years the land had peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after him came Shamgar, the son of Anath, who put to death six hundred Philistines with an ox-stick; and he was another saviour of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
