And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Manoah said, Now when your words come true, what is to be the rule for the child and what will be his work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, Let the woman take note of what I have said to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She is to have nothing which comes from the vine for her food, and let her take no wine or strong drink or anything which is unclean; let her take care to do all I have given her orders to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, Now let us keep you while we make ready a young goat for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, Though you keep me I will not take of your food; but if you will make a burned offering, let it be offered to the Lord. For it had not come into Manoah's mind that he was the angel of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, What is your name, so that when your words come true we may give you honour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the angel of the Lord said to him, Why are you questioning me about my name, seeing that it is a wonder?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took the young goat with its meal offering, offering it on the rock to the Lord, who did strange things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the flame went up to heaven from the altar, the angel of the Lord went up in the flame of the altar, while Manoah and his wife were looking on; and they went down on their faces to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the angel of the Lord was seen no more by Manoah and his wife. Then it was clear to Manoah that he was the angel of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Manoah said to his wife, Death will certainly be our fate, for it is a god whom we have seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his wife said to him, If the Lord was purposing our death, he would not have taken our burned offering and our meal offering, or have given us such orders about the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the woman gave birth to a son, and gave him the name Samson; and he became a man and the blessing of the Lord was on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the spirit of the Lord first came on him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
