So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Barak sent for Zebulun and Naphtali to come to Kedesh; and ten thousand men went up after him, and Deborah went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Heber the Kenite, separating himself from the rest of the Kenites, from the children of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, had put up his tent as far away as the oak-tree in Zaanannim, by Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And word was given to Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Sisera got together all his war-carriages, nine hundred war-carriages of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles as far as the river Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Deborah said to Barak, Up! for today the Lord has given Sisera into your hands: has not the Lord gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor and ten thousand men after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord sent fear on Sisera and all his war-carriages and all his army before Barak; and Sisera got down from his war-carriage and went in flight on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Barak went after the war-carriages and the army as far as Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all Sisera's army was put to the sword; not a man got away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Sisera went in flight on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin, king of Hazor, and the family of Heber the Kenite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jael went out to Sisera, and said to him, Come in, my lord, come in to me without fear. So he went into her tent, and she put a cover over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he said to her, Give me now a little water, for I have need of a drink. And opening a skin of milk, she gave him drink, and put the cover over him again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to her, Take your place at the door of the tent, and if anyone comes and says to you, Is there any man here, say, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent-pin and a hammer and went up to him quietly, driving the pin into his head, and it went through his head into the earth, for he was in a deep sleep from weariness; and so he came to his end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Jael went out, and meeting Barak going after Sisera, said to him, Come, and I will let you see the man you are searching for. So he came into her tent and saw, and there was Sisera stretched out dead with the tent-pin in his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So that day God overcame Jabin, king of Canaan, before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the power of the children of Israel went on increasing against Jabin, king of Canaan, till he was cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
