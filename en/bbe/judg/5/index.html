Deborah: awake! awake! give a song: Up! Barak, and take prisoner those who took you prisoner, O son of Abinoam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the chiefs went down to the doors; the Lord's people went down among the strong ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Out of Ephraim they came down into the valley; after you, Benjamin, among your tribesmen; from Machir came down the captains, and from Zebulun those in whose hand is the ruler's rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Your chiefs, Issachar, were with Deborah; and Naphtali was true to Barak; into the valley they went rushing out at his feet. In Reuben there were divisions, and great searchings of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Why did you keep quiet among the sheep, hearing nothing but the watchers piping to the flocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gilead was living over Jordan; and Dan was waiting in his ships; Asher kept in his place by the sea's edge, living by his inlets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It was the people of Zebulun who put their lives in danger, even to death, with Naphtali on the high places of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The kings came on to the fight, the kings of Canaan were warring; in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: they took no profit in money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The stars from heaven were fighting; from their highways they were fighting against Sisera.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The river Kishon took them violently away, stopping their flight, the river Kishon. Give praise, O my soul, to the strength of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then loudly the feet of the horses were sounding with the stamping, the stamping of their war-horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A curse, a curse on Meroz! said the angel of the Lord. A bitter curse on her townspeople! Because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord among the strong ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blessings be on Jael, more than on all women! Blessings greater than on any in the tents!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>His request was for water, she gave him milk; she put butter before him on a fair plate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She put out her hand to the tent-pin, and her right hand to the workman's hammer; and she gave Sisera a blow, crushing his head, wounding and driving through his brow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Bent at her feet he went down, he was stretched out; bent at her feet he went down; where he was bent down, there he went down in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Looking out from the window she gave a cry, the mother of Sisera was crying out through the window, Why is his carriage so long in coming? When will the noise of his wheels be sounding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Her wise women gave answer to her, yes, she made answer again to herself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Are they not getting, are they not parting the goods among them: a young girl or two to every man; and to Sisera robes of coloured needlework, worked in fair colours on this side and on that, for the neck of the queen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So may destruction come on all your haters, O Lord; but let your lovers be like the sun going out in his strength. And for forty years the land had peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
