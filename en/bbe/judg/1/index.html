So Simeon went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Judah went up; and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands; and they overcame ten thousand of them in Bezek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they came across Adoni-zedek, and made war on him; and they overcame the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Adoni-zedek went in flight; and they went after him and overtook him, and had his thumbs and his great toes cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Adoni-zedek said, Seventy kings, whose thumbs and great toes had been cut off, got broken meat under my table: as I have done, so has God done to me in full. And they took him to Jerusalem, and he came to his end there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the children of Judah made an attack on Jerusalem, and took it, burning down the town after they had put its people to the sword without mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After that the children of Judah went down to make war on the Canaanites living in the hill-country and in the south and in the lowlands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Caleb went against the Canaanites of Hebron: (now in earlier times Hebron was named Kiriath-arba:) and he put Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai to the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And from there he went up against the people of Debir. (Now the name of Debir in earlier times was Kiriath-sepher.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Caleb said, I will give Achsah, my daughter, as wife to the man who overcomes Kiriath-sepher and takes it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah for his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when she came to him, he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father: and she got down from her ass; and Caleb said to her, What is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to him, Give me a blessing; because you have put me in a dry south-land, now give me springs of water. So Caleb gave her the higher spring and the lower spring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now Hobab the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, had come up out of the town of palm-trees, with the children of Judah, into the waste land of Arad; and he went and was living among the Amalekites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Judah went with Simeon, his brother, and overcame the Canaanites living in Zephath, and put it under the curse; and he gave the town the name of Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah took Gaza and its limit, and Ashkelon and its limit, and Ekron and its limit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Lord was with Judah; and he took the hill-country for his heritage; but he was unable to make the people of the valley go out, for they had war-carriages of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said; and he took the land of the three sons of Anak, driving them out from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the children of Judah did not make the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem go out; the Jebusites are still living with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the family of Joseph went up against Beth-el, and the Lord was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they sent men to make a search round Beth-el. (Now the name of the town in earlier times was Luz.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the watchers saw a man coming out of the town, and said to him, If you will make clear to us the way into the town, we will be kind to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he made clear to them the way into the town, and they put it to the sword; but they let the man and all his family get away safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he went into the land of the Hittites, building a town there and naming it Luz: which is its name to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Manasseh did not take away the land of the people of Beth-shean and its daughter-towns, or of Taanach and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Dor and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Ibleam and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Megiddo and its daughter-towns, driving them out; but the Canaanites would go on living in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And whenever Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced work, without driving them out completely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Ephraim did not make the Canaanites who were living in Gezer go out; but the Canaanites went on living in Gezer among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Zebulun did not make the people of Kitron or the people of Nahalol go out; but the Canaanites went on living among them and were put to forced work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Asher did not take the land of the people of Acco, or Zidon, or Ahlab, or Achzib, or Helbah, or Aphik, or Rehob, driving them out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the Asherites went on living among the Canaanites, the people of the land, without driving them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Naphtali did not take the land of the people of Beth-shemesh or of Beth-anath, driving them out; but he was living among the Canaanites in the land; however, the people of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were put to forced work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the children of Dan were forced into the hill-country by the Amorites, who would not let them come down into the valley;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For the Amorites would go on living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but the children of Joseph became stronger than they, and put them to forced work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the limit of the Edomites went from the slope of Akrabbim from Sela and up.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
