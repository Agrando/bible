So twenty-two thousand of the people went back, but there were still ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the Lord said to Gideon, There are still more people than is necessary; take them down to the water so that I may put them to the test for you there; then whoever I say is to go with you will go, and whoever I say is not to go will not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he took the people down to the water; and the Lord said to Gideon, Put on one side by themselves all those drinking up the water with their tongues like a dog; and in the same way, all those who go down on their knees to the water while drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now the number of those who took up the water with their tongues was three hundred; all the rest of the people went down on their knees to the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord said to Gideon, By those three hundred who were drinking with their tongues I will give you salvation and give the Midianites into your hands; let the rest of the people go away, every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they took the vessels of the people, and their horns from their hands, and he sent them away, every man to his tent, keeping only the three hundred; and the tents of Midian were lower down in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The same night the Lord said to him, Up! go down now against their army, for I have given them into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if you have fear of going down, take your servant Purah with you and go down to the tents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after hearing what they are saying, you will get strength to go down against the army. So he went down with his servant Purah to the outer line of the tents of the armed men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the east were covering the valley like locusts; and their camels were like the sand by the seaside, without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Gideon came there, a man was giving his friend an account of his dream, saying, See, I had a dream about a cake of barley bread which, falling into the tents of Midian, came on to the tent, overturning it so that it was stretched out flat on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his friend in answer said, This is certainly the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, the men of Israel: into their hands God has given up all the army of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Gideon, hearing the story of the dream and the sense in which they took it, gave worship; then he went back to the tents of Israel, and said, Up! for the Lord has given the army of Midian into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then separating the three hundred men into three bands, he gave every man a horn, and a vessel in which was a flaming branch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, Keep your eyes on me, and do what I do; when I come to the outer line of tents, whatever I do, you are to do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the sound of my horn, and the horns of those who are with me, let your horns be sounded all round the tents, and say, For the Lord and for Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Gideon and the three hundred men who were with him came to the outer line of tents, at the start of the middle watch, when the watchmen had only then taken their stations; and the horns were sounded and the vessels broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the three bands all gave a loud note on their horns, and when the vessels had been broken, they took the flaming branches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands ready for blowing, crying out, For the Lord and for Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they made a line round the tents, every man in his place; and all the army, awaking from sleep, came running out, and with loud cries went in flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the three hundred gave a loud note on their horns, and every man's sword was turned by the Lord against his brother all through the army; and the army went in flight as far as Beth-shittah in the direction of Zeredah, to the edge of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel came together from Naphtali and from Asher and all Manasseh, and went after Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Gideon sent through all the hill-country of Ephraim saying, Come down against Midian, and keep the ways across Jordan before they come. So all the men of Ephraim, massing themselves together, kept the ways across Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took the two chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they put Oreb to death at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they put to death at the place of the grape-crushing in Zeeb, and they went after Midian; but the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they took across Jordan to Gideon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
