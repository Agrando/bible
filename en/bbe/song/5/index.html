Take meat, O friends; take wine, yes, be overcome with love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I am sleeping, but my heart is awake; it is the sound of my loved one at the door, saying, Be open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my very beautiful one; my head is wet with dew, and my hair with the drops of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have put off my coat; how may I put it on? My feet are washed; how may I make them unclean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My loved one put his hand on the door, and my heart was moved for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I got up to let my loved one in; and my hands were dropping with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the lock of the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I made the door open to my loved one; but my loved one had taken himself away, and was gone, my soul was feeble when his back was turned on me; I went after him, but I did not come near him; I said his name, but he gave me no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The keepers who go about the town overtook me; they gave me blows and wounds; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you see my loved one, what will you say to him? That I am overcome with love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What is your loved one more than another, O fairest among women?
