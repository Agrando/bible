but if you are given punishment for doing right, and take it quietly, this is pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is God's purpose for you: because Jesus himself underwent punishment for you, giving you an example, so that you might go in his footsteps:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who did no evil, and there was no deceit in his mouth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>To sharp words he gave no sharp answer; when he was undergoing pain, no angry word came from his lips; but he put himself into the hands of the judge of righteousness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He took our sins on himself, giving his body to be nailed on the tree, so that we, being dead to sin, might have a new life in righteousness, and by his wounds we have been made well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because, like sheep, you had gone out of the way; but now you have come back to him who keeps watch over your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
