it is dark and not light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As if a man, running away from a lion, came face to face with a bear; or went into the house and put his hand on the wall and got a bite from a snake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Will not the day of the Lord be dark and not light? even very dark, with no light shining in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Your feasts are disgusting to me, I will have nothing to do with them; I will take no delight in your holy meetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even if you give me your burned offerings and your meal offerings, I will not take pleasure in them: I will have nothing to do with the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take away from me the noise of your songs; my ears are shut to the melody of your instruments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But let the right go rolling on like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Did you come to me with offerings of beasts and meal offerings in the waste land for forty years, O Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Truly, you will take up Saccuth your king and Kaiwan your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will send you away as prisoners farther than Damascus, says the Lord, whose name is the God of armies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
