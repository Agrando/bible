eight tables, on which they put to death the beasts for the offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And there were four tables for the burned offering, made of cut stone, one and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide and a cubit high, where the instruments were placed which were used for putting to death the burned offering and the beasts for the offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they had edges all round as wide as a man's hand: and on the tables was the flesh of the offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he took me into the inner square, and there were two rooms in the inner square, one at the side of the north doorway, facing south; and one at the side of the south doorway, facing north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he said to me, This room, facing south, is for the priests who have the care of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the room facing north is for the priests who have the care of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who, from among the sons of Levi, come near to the Lord to do the work of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he took the measure of the open square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide, being square;
