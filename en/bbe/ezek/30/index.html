it will be the time of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And a sword will come on Egypt, and cruel pain will be in Ethiopia, when they are falling by the sword in Egypt; and they will take away her wealth and her bases will be broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ethiopia and Put and Lud and all the mixed people and Libya and the children of the land of the Cherethites will all be put to death with them by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is what the Lord has said: The supporters of Egypt will have a fall, and the pride of her power will come down: from Migdol to Syene they will be put to the sword in it, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she will be made waste among the countries which have been made waste, and her towns will be among the towns which are unpeopled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they will be certain that I am the Lord, when I have put a fire in Egypt and all her helpers are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In that day men will go out quickly to take the news, causing fear in untroubled Ethiopia; and bitter pain will come on them as in the day of Egypt; for see, it is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is what the Lord has said: I will put an end to great numbers of the people of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He and the people with him, causing fear among the nations, will be sent for the destruction of the land;
