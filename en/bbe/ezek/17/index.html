Say to them, See, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and its rulers away with him to Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he took one of the sons of the king and made an agreement with him; and he put him under an oath, and took away the great men of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So that the kingdom might be made low with no power of lifting itself up, but might keep his agreement to be his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he went against his authority in sending representatives to Egypt to get from them horses and a great army. Will he do well? will he be safe who does such things? if the agreement is broken will he be safe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By my life, says the Lord, truly in the place of the king who made him king, whose oath he put on one side and let his agreement with him be broken, even in Babylon he will come to his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh with his strong army and great forces will be no help to him in the war, when they put up earthworks and make strong walls for the cutting off of lives:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he put his oath on one side in letting the agreement be broken; and though he had given his hand to it, he did all these things; he will not get away safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And so the Lord has said, By my life, truly, for my oath which he put on one side, and my agreement which has been broken, I will send punishment on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My net will be stretched out over him, and he will be taken in my cords, and I will send him to Babylon, and there I will be his judge for the wrong which he has done against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All his best fighting-men will be put to the sword, and the rest will be sent away to every wind: and you will be certain that I the Lord have said it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This is what the Lord has said: Further, I will take the highest top of the cedar and put it in the earth; cutting off from the highest of his young branches a soft one, I will have it planted on a high and great mountain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It will be planted on the high mountain of Israel: it will put out branches and have fruit and be a fair cedar: under it all birds of every sort will make their living-place, resting in the shade of its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it will be clear to all the trees of the field that I the Lord have made low the high tree and made high the low tree, drying up the green tree and making the dry tree full of growth; I the Lord have said it and have done it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
