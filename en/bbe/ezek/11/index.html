Then falling down on my face and crying out with a loud voice, I said, Ah, Lord! will you put an end to all the rest of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Son of man, your countrymen, your relations, and all the children of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the people of Jerusalem have said, Go far from the Lord; this land is given to us for a heritage:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this reason say, This is what the Lord has said: Though I have had them moved far off among the nations, and though I have sent them wandering among the countries, still I have been a safe place for them for a little time in the countries where they have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then say, This is what the Lord has said: I will get you together from the peoples, and make you come out of the countries where you have been sent in flight, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they will come there, and take away all the hated and disgusting things from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give them a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in them; and I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So that they may be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them: and they will be to me a people, and I will be to them a God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as for those whose heart goes after their hated and disgusting things, I will send on their heads the punishment of their ways, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the wings of the winged ones were lifted up, and the wheels were by their side; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the glory of the Lord went up from inside the town, and came to rest on the mountain on the east side of the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the wind, lifting me up, took me in the visions of God into Chaldaea, to those who had been taken away as prisoners. So the vision which I had seen went away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then I gave an account to those who had been taken prisoners of all the things which the Lord had made me see.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
