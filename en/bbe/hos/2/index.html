and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Take up the cause against your mother, take it up, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; let her put away her loose ways from her face, and her false ways from between her breasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For fear that I may take away her robe from her, making her uncovered as in the day of her birth; making her like a waste place and a dry land, causing her death through need of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will have no mercy on her children, for they are the children of her loose ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For their mother has been untrue; she who gave them birth has done things of shame, for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this cause I will put thorns in her road, building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them; if she makes search for them she will not see them; then will she say, I will go back to my first husband, for then it was better for me than now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For she had no knowledge that it was I who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil, increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I will take away again my grain in its time and my wine, and I will take away my wool and my linen with which her body might have been covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now I will make her shame clear before the eyes of her lovers, and no one will take her out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will put an end to all her joy, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her regular meetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are the payments which my lovers have made to me; and I will make them a waste of trees, and the beasts of the field will take them for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will give her punishment for the days of the Baals, to whom she has been burning perfumes, when she made herself fair with her nose-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, giving no thought to me, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this cause I will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will give her vine-gardens from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young, and as in the time when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in that day, says the Lord, you will say to me, Ishi; and you will never again give me the name of Baali;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and never again will she say their names.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day I will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth; I will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land, and will make them take their rest in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will take you as my bride for ever; truly, I will take you as my bride in righteousness and in right judging, in love and in mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will take you as my bride in good faith, and you will have knowledge of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will be, in that day, says the Lord, that I will give an answer to the heavens, and the heavens to the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the earth will give its answer to the grain and the wine and the oil, and they will give an answer to Jezreel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will put her as seed in the earth, and I will have mercy on her to whom no mercy was given; and I will say to those who were not my people, You are my people, and they will say, My God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
