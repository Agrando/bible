only that in every way, falsely or truly, the preaching of Christ goes on; and in this I am glad, and will be glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I am conscious that this will be for my salvation, through your prayer and the giving out of the stored wealth of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In the measure of my strong hope and belief that in nothing will I be put to shame, but that without fear, as at all times, so now will Christ have glory in my body, by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me life is Christ and death is profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I go on living in the flesh--if this is the fruit of my work--then I do not see what decision to make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am in a hard position between the two, having a desire to go away and be with Christ, which is very much better:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Still, to go on in the flesh is more necessary because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And being certain of this, I am conscious that I will go on, yes, and go on with you all, for your growth and joy in the faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So that your pride in me may be increased in Christ Jesus through my being present with you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your behaviour do credit to the good news of Christ, so that if I come and see you or if I am away from you, I may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit, working together with one soul for the faith of the good news;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Having no fear of those who are against you; which is a clear sign of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because to you it has been given in the cause of Christ not only to have faith in him, but to undergo pain on his account:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Fighting the same fight which you saw in me, and now have word of in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
