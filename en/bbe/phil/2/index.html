so that I may have glory in you in the day of Christ, because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And even if I am offered like a drink offering, giving myself for the cause and work of your faith, I am glad and have joy with you all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may be comforted when I have news of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For they all go after what is theirs, not after the things of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his quality is clear to you; how, as a child is to its father, so he was a help to me in the work of the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him then I am hoping to send as quickly as possible, when I am able to see how things will go for me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I have faith in the Lord that I myself will come before long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But it seemed to me necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight, and your servant, sent by you for help in my need;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Because his heart was with you all, and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For in fact he was ill almost to death: but God had mercy on him; and not only on him but on me, so that I might not have grief on grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have sent him, then, the more gladly, so that when you see him again, you may be happy and I may have the less sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So take him to your hearts in the Lord with all joy, and give honour to such as he is:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
