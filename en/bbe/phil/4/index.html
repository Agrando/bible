The Lord is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Have no cares; but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the peace of God, which is deeper than all knowledge, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the rest, my brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things have honour, whatever things are upright, whatever things are holy, whatever things are beautiful, whatever things are of value, if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, give thought to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The things which came to you by my teaching and preaching, and which you saw in me, these things do, and the God of peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I am very glad in the Lord that your care for me has come to life again; though you did in fact take thought for me, but you were not able to give effect to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I will not say anything about my needs, for I am able, wherever I am, to be dependent on myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is the same to me if I am looked down on or honoured; everywhere and in all things I have the secret of how to be full and how to go without food; how to have wealth and how to be in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am able to do all things through him who gives me strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But you did well to have care for me in my need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you have knowledge, Philippians, that when the good news first came to you, when I went away from Macedonia, no church took part with me in the business of giving to the saints, but you only;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to me in my need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not that I am looking for an offering, but for fruit which may be put to your credit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have all things and more than enough: I am made full, having had from Epaphroditus the things which came from you, a perfume of a sweet smell, an offering well pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And my God will give you all you have need of from the wealth of his glory in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now to God our Father be glory for ever and ever.
