and some, preachers of the good news; and some to give care and teaching;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the training of the saints as servants in the church, for the building up of the body of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Till we all come to the harmony of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to full growth, to the full measure of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So that we may be no longer children, sent this way and that, turned about by every wind of teaching, by the twisting and tricks of men, by the deceits of error;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But saying true words in love, may come to full growth in him, who is the head, even Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Through whom all the body, being rightly formed and united together, by the full working of every part, is increased to the building up of itself in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This I say, then, and give witness in the Lord, that you are to go no longer in the way of the Gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whose thoughts are dark, to whom the life of God is strange because they are without knowledge, and their hearts have been made hard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who having no more power of feeling, have given themselves up to evil passions, to do all unclean things with overmuch desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For this was not the teaching of Christ which was given to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If in fact you gave ear to him, and were given teaching in him, even as what is true is made clear in Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That you are to put away, in relation to your earlier way of life, the old man, which has become evil by love of deceit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And be made new in the spirit of your mind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And put on the new man, to which God has given life, in righteousness and a true and holy way of living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And so, putting away false words, let everyone say what is true to his neighbour: for we are parts one of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Be angry without doing wrong;
