He who has love for his wife has love for himself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever had hate for his flesh; but he gives it food and takes care of it, even as Christ does for the church;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because we are parts of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is a great secret: but my words are about Christ and the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But do you, everyone, have love for his wife, even as for himself; and let the wife see that she has respect for her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
