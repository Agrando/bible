or did you come into being before the hills?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keep what he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
