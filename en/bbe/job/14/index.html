But it is not possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If his days are ordered, and you have knowledge of the number of his months, having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let your eyes be turned away from him, and take your hand from him, so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day, like a servant working for payment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there is hope of a tree; if it is cut down, it will come to life again, and its branches will not come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though its root may be old in the earth, and its cut-off end may be dead in the dust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Still, at the smell of water, it will make buds, and put out branches like a young plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But man comes to his death and is gone: he gives up his spirit, and where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The waters go from a pool, and a river becomes waste and dry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So man goes down to his last resting-place and comes not again: till the heavens come to an end, they will not be awake or come out of their sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If only you would keep me safe in the underworld, putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past, giving me a fixed time when I might come to your memory again!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If death takes a man, will he come to life again? All the days of my trouble I would be waiting, till the time came for me to be free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At the sound of your voice I would give an answer, and you would have a desire for the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For now my steps are numbered by you, and my sin is not overlooked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My wrongdoing is corded up in a bag, and my sin is shut up safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But truly a mountain falling comes to dust, and a rock is moved from its place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The stones are crushed small by the force of the waters; the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing: and so you put an end to the hope of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You overcome him for ever, and he is gone; his face is changed in death, and you send him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His sons come to honour, and he has no knowledge of it; they are made low, but he is not conscious of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Only his flesh still has pain, and his soul is sad.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
