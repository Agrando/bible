Let it be far from God to do evil, and from the Ruler of all to do wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he gives to every man the reward of his work, and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly, God does not do evil, and the Ruler of all is not a false judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who put the earth into his care, or made him responsible for the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he made his spirit come back to him, taking his breath into himself again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All flesh would come to an end together, and man would go back to the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If you are wise, take note of this; give ear to the voice of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How may a hater of right be a ruler? and will you say that the upright Ruler of all is evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who says to a king, You are an evil-doer; and to rulers, You are sinners;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who has no respect for rulers, and who gives no more attention to those who have wealth than to the poor, for they are all the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Suddenly they come to an end, even in the middle of the night: the blow comes on the men of wealth, and they are gone, and the strong are taken away without the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no dark place, and no thick cloud, in which the workers of evil may take cover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause, and puts others in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he has knowledge of their works, overturning them in the night, so that they are crushed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The evil-doers are broken by his wrath, he puts his hand on them with force before the eyes of all onlookers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because they did not go after him, and took no note of his ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So that the cry of the poor might come up to him, and the prayer of those in need come to his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men of knowledge, and all wise men, hearing me, will say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job's words do not come from knowledge; they are not the fruit of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>May Job be tested to the end, because his answers have been like those of evil men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For in addition to his sin, he is uncontrolled in heart; before our eyes he makes sport of God, increasing his words against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
