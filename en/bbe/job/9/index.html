who may say to him, What are you doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>God's wrath may not be turned back; the helpers of Rahab were bent down under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How much less may I give an answer to him, using the right words in argument with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Even if my cause was good, I would not be able to give an answer; I would make request for grace from him who was against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If I had sent for him to be present, and he had come, I would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I would be crushed by his storm, my wounds would be increased without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He would not let me take my breath, but I would be full of bitter grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If it is a question of strength, he says, Here I am! and if it is a question of a cause at law, he says, Who will give me a fixed day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Though I was in the right, he would say that I was in the wrong; I have done no evil; but he says that I am a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have done no wrong; I give no thought to what becomes of me; I have no desire for life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is all the same to me; so I say, He puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If death comes suddenly through disease, he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The land is given into the power of the evil-doer; the faces of its judges are covered; if not by him, then who has done it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>My days go quicker than a post-runner: they go in flight, they see no good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They go rushing on like reed-boats, like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If I say, I will put my grief out of mind, I will let my face be sad no longer and I will be bright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I go in fear of all my pains; I am certain that I will not be free from sin in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You will not let me be clear of sin! why then do I take trouble for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I am washed with snow water, and make my hands clean with soap;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then you will have me pushed into the dust, so that I will seem disgusting to my very clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he is not a man as I am, that I might give him an answer, that we might come together before a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>There is no one to give a decision between us, who might have control over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then I would say what is in my mind without fear of him; for there is no cause of fear in myself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
