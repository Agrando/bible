No, for a man's wisdom is only of profit to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it of any interest to the Ruler of all that you are upright? or is it of use to him that your ways are without sin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Is it because you give him honour that he is sending punishment on you and is judging you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not your evil-doing great? and there is no end to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For you have taken your brother's goods when he was not in your debt, and have taken away the clothing of those who have need of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You do not give water to the tired traveller, and from him who has no food you keep back bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For it was the man with power who had the land, and the man with an honoured name who was living in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have sent widows away without hearing their cause, and you have taken away the support of the child who has no father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this cause nets are round your feet, and you are overcome with sudden fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Your light is made dark so that you are unable to see, and you are covered by a mass of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not God as high as heaven? and see the stars, how high they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you say, What knowledge has God? is he able to give decisions through the deep dark?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thick clouds are covering him, so that he is unable to see; and he is walking on the arch of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Will you keep the old way by which evil men went?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were violently taken away before their time, who were overcome by the rush of waters:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who said to God, Go away from us; and, What is the Ruler of all able to do to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Though he made their houses full of good things: but the purpose of the evil-doers is far from me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The upright saw it and were glad: and those who had done no wrong made sport of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Saying, Truly, their substance is cut off, and their wealth is food for the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Put yourself now in a right relation with him and be at peace: so will you do well in your undertakings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Be pleased to take teaching from his mouth, and let his words be stored up in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you come back to the Ruler of all, making yourself low before him; if you put evil far away from your tents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And put your gold in the dust, even your gold of Ophir among the rocks of the valleys;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the Ruler of all will be your gold, and his teaching will be your silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For then you will have delight in the Ruler of all, and your face will be lifted up to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You will make your prayer to him, and be answered; and you will give effect to your oaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Your purposes will come about, and light will be shining on your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For God makes low those whose hearts are lifted up, but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He makes safe the man who is free from sin, and if your hands are clean, salvation will be yours.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
