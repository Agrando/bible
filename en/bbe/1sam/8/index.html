And Samuel made prayer to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to the voice of the people and what they say to you: they have not been turned away from you, but they have been turned away from me, not desiring me to be king over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As they have done from the first, from the day when I took them out of Egypt till this day, turning away from me and worshipping other gods, so now they are acting in the same way to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Give ear now to their voice: but make a serious protest to them, and give them a picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Samuel said all these words of the Lord to the people who were desiring a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, This is the sort of king who will be your ruler: he will take your sons and make them his servants, his horsemen, and drivers of his war-carriages, and they will go running before his war-carriages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties; some he will put to work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his war-carriages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread-makers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will take your fields and your vine-gardens and your olive-gardens, all the best of them, and give them to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will take your men-servants and your servant-girls, and the best of your oxen and your asses and put them to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He will take a tenth of your sheep: and you will be his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves; but the Lord will not give you an answer in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the people gave no attention to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No, but we will have a king over us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So that we may be like the other nations, and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Samuel, after hearing all the people had to say, went and gave an account of it to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to their voice and make a king for them. Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let every man go back to his town.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
