And Samuel was judge of the children of Israel in Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when the Philistines had news that the children of Israel had come together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And the children of Israel, hearing of it, were full of fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Go on crying to the Lord our God for us to make us safe from the hands of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Samuel took a young lamb, offering all of it as a burned offering to the Lord; and Samuel made prayers to the Lord for Israel and the Lord gave him an answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while Samuel was offering the burned offering, the Philistines came near for the attack on Israel; but at the thunder of the Lord's voice that day the Philistines were overcome with fear, and they gave way before Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and went after the Philistines, attacking them till they came under Beth-car.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Samuel took a stone and put it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah, naming it Eben-ezer, and saying, Up to now the Lord has been our help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Philistines were overcome, and did not come into the country of Israel again: and all the days of Samuel the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the towns which the Philistines had taken were given back to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and all the country round them Israel made free from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel was judge of Israel all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From year to year he went in turn to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And his base was at Ramah, where his house was; there he was judge of Israel and there he made an altar to the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
