And David said, there is no other sword like that; give it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then David got up and went in flight that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish, the king of Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David, the king of the land? did they not make songs about him in their dances, saying, Saul has put to death thousands, and David tens of thousands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David took these words to heart, fearing Achish, the king of Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So changing his behaviour before them, he made it seem as if he was off his head, hammering on the doors of the town, and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Achish said to his servants, Look! the man is clearly off his head; why have you let him come before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Are there not enough unbalanced men about me, that you have let this person come and do such tricks before me? is such a man to come into my house?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
