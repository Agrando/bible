and he made his son Solomon king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he got together all the chiefs of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the Levites, all those of thirty years old and over, were numbered; and the number of them, by heads, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Of these, twenty-four thousand were to be overseers of the work of the house of the Lord, and six thousand were judges and men of authority;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Four thousand were door-keepers; and four thousand gave praise to the Lord with the instruments which I made, said David, for giving praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David put them into divisions under the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham and Joel, three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran, three; these were the heads of the families of Ladan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zizah and Jeush and Beriah; these four were the sons of Shimei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jahath was the chief and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah had only a small number of sons, so they were grouped together as one family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was made separate and holy, he and his sons for ever, for the care of the most holy things and the burning of offerings before the Lord, to do his work and give blessings in his name for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the sons of Moses, the man of God, were put into the list of the tribe of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the first;
