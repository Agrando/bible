and he got ready a place for the ark of God, and put up a tent for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then David said, The ark of God may not be moved by any but the Levites, for they have been marked out by God to take the ark of God, and to do his work for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David made all Israel come together at Jerusalem, to take the ark of the Lord to its place, which he had got ready for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David got together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief, and his brothers, a hundred and twenty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Of the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief, and his brothers, two hundred and twenty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, and his brothers, a hundred and thirty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers, two hundred;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief, and his brothers, eighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, and his brothers, a hundred and twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David sent for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, Uriel, Asaiah and Joel, Shemaiah and Eliel and Amminadab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And said to them, You are the heads of the families of the Levites: make yourselves holy, you and your brothers, so that you may take the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place which I have made ready for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For because you did not take it at the first, the Lord our God sent punishment on us, because we did not get directions from him in the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the priests and the Levites made themselves holy to take up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the sons of the Levites took up the ark of God, lifting it by its rods, as the Lord had said to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David gave orders to the chief of the Levites to put their brothers the music-makers in position, with instruments of music, corded instruments and brass, with glad voices making sounds of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Heman, the son of Joel, and, of his brothers, Asaph, the son of Berechiah;
