But his servant, full of fear, would not do so. Then Saul took out his sword, falling on it himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when his servant saw that Saul was dead, he did the same, and came to his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So death overtook Saul and his three sons; all his family came to an end together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the men of Israel had gone in flight and that Saul and his sons were dead, they went in flight away from their towns; and the Philistines came and took them for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now the day after, when the Philistines came to take their goods from the dead, they saw Saul and his sons dead in Mount Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they took everything off him, and took his head and his war-dress, and sent word into the land of the Philistines round about to give the news to their gods and to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they put his war-dress in the house of their gods, and put up his head in the house of Dagon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the news came to Jabesh-gilead of what the Philistines had done to Saul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the fighting-men came up and took away Saul's body and the bodies of his sons, and took them to Jabesh, and put their bones to rest under the oak-tree in Jabesh, and took no food for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So death came to Saul because of the sin which he did against the Lord, that is, because of the word of the Lord which he kept not; and because he went for directions to one who had an evil spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And not to the Lord: for this reason, he put him to death and gave the kingdom to David, the son of Jesse.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
