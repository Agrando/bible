But still, David took the strong place of Zion, which is the town of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said, The first to overcome the Jebusites will be chief and captain. And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up first, and became chief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David took the strong tower for his living-place, so it was named the town of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo; and Joab put the rest of the town in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David became greater and greater in power, because the Lord of armies was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now these are the chief of David's men of war who were his strong supporters in the kingdom, and, with all Israel, made him king, as the Lord had said about Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the list of David's men of war: Ishbaal, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the three: he put to death three hundred at one time with his spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo the Ahohite, who was one of the three great fighters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was with David at Pas-dammim, where the Philistines had come together for the fight, near a bit of land full of barley; and the people went in flight before the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took up his position in the middle of the bit of land, and kept back their attack, and overcame the Philistines; and the Lord gave a great salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And three of the thirty went down to David, to the rock, into the strong place of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines had taken up their position in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time David had taken cover in the strong place, and an armed force of the Philistines was in Beth-lehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David, moved by a strong desire, said, If only someone would give me a drink of the water from the water-hole of Beth-lehem by the doorway into the town!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the three, forcing a way through the Philistine army, got water from the water-hole of Beth-lehem, by the doorway into the town, and took it back to David; but David would not take it, but made an offering of it, draining it out to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Saying, By my God, far be it from me to do this!
