And Ahab made a feast for him and the people who were with him, putting to death great numbers of sheep and oxen; and he got Jehoshaphat to go with him to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Ahab, king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he said, I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will be with you in the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us now get directions from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the king of Israel got together all the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Am I to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And they said, Go up: for God will give it into the hands of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord, but I have no love for him, because he has never been a prophet of good to me, but only of evil: he is Micaiah, the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said, Go quickly and come back with Micaiah, the son of Imla.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were seated on their seats of authority, dressed in their robes, by the doorway into Samaria; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself iron horns and said, The Lord says, Pushing back the Aramaeans with these, you will put an end to them completely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the prophets said the same thing, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and it will go well for you, for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, See now, all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king; so let your words be like theirs, and say good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Micaiah said, By the living Lord, whatever the Lord says to me I will say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, are we to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And he said, Go up, and it will go well for you; and they will be given up into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king said to him, Have I not, again and again, put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he said, I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper; and the Lord said, These have no master: let them go back, every man to his house in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good to me, but of evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he said, Give ear now to the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power, and all the army of heaven in their places, at his right hand and at his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Lord said, How may Ahab, king of Israel, be tricked into going up to Ramoth-gilead to his death? And one said one thing and one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said, I will get him to do it by a trick. And the Lord said to him, How?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Your trick will have its effect on him: go out and do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours; and the Lord has said evil against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of his face, saying, Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Micaiah said, Truly, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the ruler of the town, and to Joash, the king's son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And say, By the king's order this man is to be put in prison, and given prison food till I come back in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Micaiah said, If you come back at all in peace, the Lord has not sent his word by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will make a change in my clothing, so that I do not seem to be the king, and will go into the fight; but do you put on your robes. So the king of Israel made a change in his dress, and they went to the fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the king of Aram had given orders to the captains of his war-carriages, saying, Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So when the captains of the war-carriages saw Jehoshaphat, they said, It is the king of Israel. And turning about, they came round him, but Jehoshaphat gave a cry, and the Lord came to his help, and God sent them away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when the captains of the war-carriages saw that he was not the king of Israel, they went back from going after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction, and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing; so he said to the driver of his war-carriage, Go to one side and take me away out of the army, for I am badly wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the fight became more violent while the day went on; and the king of Israel was supported in his war-carriage facing the Aramaeans till the evening; and by sundown he was dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
