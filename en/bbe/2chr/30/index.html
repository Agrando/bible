For Hezekiah had made prayer for them, saying, May the good Lord have mercy on everyone</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who, with all his heart, is turned to God the Lord, the God of his fathers, even if he has not been made clean after the rules of the holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord gave ear to Hezekiah, and made the people well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great joy: and the Levites and the priests gave praise to the Lord day by day, making melody to the Lord with loud instruments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah said kind words to the Levites who were expert in the ordering of the worship of the Lord: so they kept the feast for seven days, offering peace-offerings and praising the Lord, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And by the desire of all the people, the feast went on for another seven days, and they kept the seven days with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah, king of Judah, gave to the people for offerings, a thousand oxen and seven thousand sheep; and the rulers gave a thousand oxen and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests made themselves holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the people of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and those who had come from Israel, and men from other lands who had come from Israel or who were living in Judah, were glad with great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for nothing like this had been seen in Jerusalem from the time of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the priests and the Levites gave the people a blessing: and the voice of their prayer went up to the holy place of God in heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
