And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Shaphan took the book to the king; and he gave him an account of what had been done, saying, Your servants are doing all they have been given to do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They have taken out all the money which was in the Lord's house and have given it to the overseers and to the workmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book; and he made a start at reading some of it to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the king, hearing the words of the law, took his robe in his hands, violently parting it as a sign of his grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he gave orders to Hilkiah and to Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah, the king's servant, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go and get directions from the Lord for me and for those who are still in Israel and for Judah, about the words of this book which has come to light; for great is the wrath of the Lord which has been let loose on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord or done what is recorded in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Hilkiah, and those whom the king sent, went to Huldah the woman prophet, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the robes (now she was living in Jerusalem, in the second part of the town); and they had talk with her about this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she said to them, The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, Say to the man who sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These are the words of the Lord: See, I will send evil on this place and on its people, even all the curses in the book which they have been reading before the king of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because they have given me up, burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the works of their hands; so my wrath is let loose on this place and will not be put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from the Lord, say, This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said: Because you have given ear to my words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And your heart was soft, and you made yourself low before God, on hearing his words about this place and its people, and with weeping and signs of grief have made yourself low before me, I have given ear to you, says the Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>See, I will let you go to your fathers, and be put in your last resting-place in peace, and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will send on this place and on its people. So they took this news back to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of Judah and of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king went up to the house of the Lord, with all the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem, and the priests and the Levites and all the people, small and great; and they were present at his reading of the book of the law which had come to light in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the king, taking his place by the pillar, made an agreement before the Lord, to go in the way of the Lord, and to keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and with all his soul, and to keep the words of the agreement recorded in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he made all the people in Jerusalem and Benjamin give their word to keep it. And the people of Jerusalem kept the agreement of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Josiah took away all the disgusting things out of all the lands of the children of Israel, and made all who were in Israel servants of the Lord their God. And as long as he was living they were true to the Lord, the God of their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
