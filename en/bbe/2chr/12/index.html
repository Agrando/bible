Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he was ruling for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there; and his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he did evil because his heart was not true to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not recorded in the words of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David; and Abijah his son became king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
