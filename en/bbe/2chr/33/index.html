Then Manasseh was certain that the Lord was God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After this he made an outer wall for the town of David, on the west side of Gihon in the valley, as far as the way into the town by the fish doorway; and he put a very high wall round the Ophel; and he put captains of the army in all the walled towns of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He took away the strange gods and the image out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars he had put up on the hill of the Lord's house and in Jerusalem, and put them out of the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he put the altar of the Lord in order, offering peace-offerings and praise-offerings on it, and said that all Judah were to be servants of the Lord, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>However, the people still made offerings in the high places, but only to the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words which the seers said to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, are recorded among the acts of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the prayer which he made to God, and how God gave him an answer, and all his sin and his wrongdoing, and the places where he made high places and put up pillars of wood and images, before he put away his pride, are recorded in the history of the seers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Manasseh went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body to rest in his house, and Amon his son became king in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling for two years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Manasseh his father had done; and Amon made offerings to all the images which his father Manasseh had made, and was their servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He did not make himself low before the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done, but went on sinning more and more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his servants made a secret design against him, and put him to death in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against King Amon, and made his son Josiah king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
