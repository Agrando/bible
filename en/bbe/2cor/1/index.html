or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh, saying, Yes, today, and, No, tomorrow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As God is true, our word to you is not Yes and No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we were preaching among you, even I and Silvanus and Timothy, was not Yes and No, but in him is Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For he is the Yes to all the undertakings of God: and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect, to the glory of God through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now he who makes our faith strong together with you, in Christ, and has given us of his grace, is God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it is he who has put his stamp on us, even the Spirit, as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But God is my witness that it was in pity for you that I did not come to Corinth at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not that we have authority over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy: for it is faith which is your support.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
