But if anyone puts himself forward (I am talking like a foolish person), I will do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they of Israel? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they servants of Christ? (I am talking foolishly) I am more so; I have had more experience of hard work, of prisons, of blows more than measure, of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Five times the Jews gave me forty blows but one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times I was whipped with rods, once I was stoned, three times the ship I was in came to destruction at sea, a night and a day I have been in the water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In frequent travels, in dangers on rivers, in dangers from outlaws, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the town, in dangers in the waste land, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In hard work and weariness, in frequent watchings, going without food and drink, cold and in need of clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In addition to all the other things, there is that which comes on me every day, the care of all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is feeble and I am not feeble? who is in danger of falling, and I am not angry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I have to take credit to myself, I will do so in the things in which I am feeble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be praise for ever, is witness that the things which I say are true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus, the ruler under Aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of Damascus, in order to take me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And being let down in a basket from the wall through a window, I got free from his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
