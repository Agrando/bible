In everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So though I sent you a letter, it was not only because of the man who did the wrong, or because of him to whom the wrong was done, but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So we have been comforted: and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of Titus, for his spirit had been made glad by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For I was not put to shame in anything in which I may have made clear to him my pride in you; but as we said nothing to you but what was true, so the good things which I said to Titus about you were seen by him to be true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all, how you gave way to his authority, and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
