Most gladly, then, will I take pride in my feeble body, so that the power of Christ may be on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I take pleasure in being feeble, in unkind words, in needs, in cruel attacks, in troubles, on account of Christ: for when I am feeble, then am I strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have been forced by you to become foolish, though it was right for my praise to have come from you: for in no way was I less than the chief of the Apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an Apostle were done among you in quiet strength, with wonders and acts of power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is there in which you were made less than the other churches, but in the one thing that I was not a trouble to you? Let me have forgiveness for this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is now the third time that I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a trouble to you: my desire is for you, not for your property: for it is not the children's business to make store for their fathers, but the fathers for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will gladly give all I have for your souls. If I have the more love for you, am I to be loved the less?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But let it be so, that I was not a trouble to you myself; but (someone may say) being false, I took you with deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I make a profit out of you by any of those whom I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I gave orders to Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus make any profit out of you? were we not guided by the same Spirit, in the same ways?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It may seem to you that all this time we have been attempting to put ourselves in the right; but we are saying these things before God in Christ. For all things, dear brothers, are for your profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have a fear that, when I come, you may not be answering to my desire, and that I may not be answering to yours; that there may be fighting, hate, angry feeling, divisions, evil talk about others, secrets, thoughts of pride, outbursts against authority;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And that when I come again, my God may put me to shame among you, and I may have grief for those who have done wrong before and have had no regret for their unclean ways, and for the evil desires of the flesh to which they have given way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
