If any man seems to himself to be Christ's, let him keep in mind that we are as much Christ's as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For though I might take pride in our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for your destruction), it will not be a cause of shame to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That I may not seem to have the desire of causing you fear by my letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For his letters, they say, have weight and are strong; but in body he is feeble, and his way of talking has little force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let those who say this keep in mind that, what we are in word by letters when we are away, so will we be in act when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we will not make comparison of ourselves with some of those who say good things about themselves: but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and making comparison of themselves with themselves, are not wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We will not give glory to ourselves in over-great measure, but after the measure of the rule which God has given us, a measure which comes even to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have no need to make ourselves seem more than we are, as if our authority did not come as far as to you: for we came even as far as you with the good news of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Not taking credit to ourselves for what is not our business, that is, for the work of others; but having hope that, with the growth of your faith, we may get the credit for an increase which is the effect of our work,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So that we may be able to go on and take the good news to countries still farther away than you are, and not take credit for another man's work in making things ready to our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the Lord's approval of a man is not dependent on his opinion of himself, but on the Lord's opinion of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
