so that as you had a ready mind, you may give effect to it as you are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For if there is a ready mind, a man will have God's approval in the measure of what he has, and not of what he has not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I am not saying this so that others may get off free, while the weight comes on you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But so that things may be equal; that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped, and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way, making things equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As it says in the Writings, He who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But praise be to God, who puts the same care for you into the heart of Titus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For while he gladly gave ear to our request, he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not only so, but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the Lord and to make clear that our mind was ready:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval, not only of the Lord, but of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we have sent with them our brother, whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number, but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any question comes up about Titus, he is my brother-worker, working with me for you; or about the others, they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Make clear then to them, as representatives of the churches, the quality of your love, and that the things which we have said about you are true.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
