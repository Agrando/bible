So be it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you, let there be a curse on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you, let there be a curse on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Am I now using arguments to men, or God? or is it my desire to give men pleasure? if I was still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because I say to you, my brothers, that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews' religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I went farther in the Jews' religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen, having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body, through his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and again I came back to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and was there with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But of the other Apostles I saw only James, the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they gave glory to God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
