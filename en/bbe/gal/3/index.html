He says not, And to seeds, as of a great number; but as of one, he says, And to your seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now this I say: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not put an end to the agreement made before by God, so as to make the undertaking without effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because if the heritage is by the law, it is no longer dependent on the word of God; but God gave it to Abraham by his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What then is the law? It was an addition made because of sin, till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given; and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go-between.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now a go-between is not a go-between of one; but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the law then against the words of God? in no way; because if there had been a law which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>However, the holy Writings have put all things under sin, so that that for which God gave the undertaking, based on faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who have such faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were kept in prison under the law, waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ, so that we might have righteousness by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For all those of you who were given baptism into Christ did put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is no Jew or Greek, servant or free, male or female: because you are all one in Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and yours is the heritage by the right of God's undertaking given to Abraham.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
