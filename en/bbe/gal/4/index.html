You have done me no wrong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you have knowledge that with a feeble body I was preaching the good news to you the first time;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh, or put shame on it; but you took me to your hearts as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where then is that happy condition of yours? because I give you witness, that, if possible, you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then am I no longer your friend, because I give you true words?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Their interest in you is not good; but their desire is that you may be shut out, so that you may go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My children, of whom I am again in birth-pains till Christ is formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly my desire is to be present with you now, using a changed voice; for I am troubled about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Say, you whose desire it is to be under the law, do you not give ear to the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because it is in the Writings, that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant-woman, and one by the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the son by the servant-woman has his birth after the flesh; but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things have a secret sense; because these women are the two agreements; one from the mountain of Sinai, giving birth to servants, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia, and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is: which is a servant with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem on high is free, which is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is in the Writings, You who have never given birth, be glad; give cries of joy, you who have had no birth-pains; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of the undertaking of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the Spirit, even so it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What then do the Writings say? Send away the servant-woman and her son; for the son of the servant-woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So, brothers, we are not children of the servant-woman, but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
