from every man who has the impulse in his heart take an offering for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this is the offering you are to take from them: gold and silver and brass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And blue and purple and red, and the best linen, and goats' hair;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And sheepskins coloured red, and leather, and hard wood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Oil for the light, spices for the sweet-smelling oil, sweet perfumes for burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beryls and stones of value to be put on the ephod and on the priest's bag.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And let them make me a holy place, so that I may be ever present among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Make the House and everything in it from the designs which I will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they are to make an ark of hard wood; two and a half cubits long, and a cubit and a half wide and high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is to be plated inside and out with the best gold, with an edge of gold all round it</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And make four rings of gold for it, to be fixed on its four feet, two rings on one side of it and two on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And make rods of the same wood, plating them with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And put the rods through the rings at the sides of the ark, for lifting it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The rods are to be kept in the rings, and never taken out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Inside the ark you are to put the record which I will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you are to make a cover of the best gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And at the two ends of the cover you are to make two winged ones of hammered gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>One at one end and one at the other; the winged ones are to be part of the cover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And their wings are to be outstretched over the cover, and the winged ones are to be opposite one another, facing the cover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And put the cover over the ark, and in the ark the record which I will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And there, between the two winged ones on the cover of the ark, I will come to you, face to face, and make clear to you all the orders I have to give you for the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you are to make a table of the same wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Plated with the best gold, with a gold edge all round it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And make a frame all round it, as wide as a man's hand, with a gold edge to the frame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And make four gold rings and put them at the four angles, on the four feet of the table;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The rings are to be fixed under the frame to take the rods with which the table is to be lifted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Make rods of the same wood, plated with gold, for lifting the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And make the table-vessels, the spoons and the cups and the basins for liquids, all of the best gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And on the table at all times you are to keep my holy bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you are to make a support for lights, of the best gold; its base and its pillar are to be of hammered gold; its cups, its buds, and its flowers are to be made of the same metal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It is to have six branches coming out from its sides; three branches from one side and three from the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Every branch having three cups made like almond flowers, every cup with a bud and a flower, on all the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And on the pillar, four cups like almond flowers, every one with its bud and its flower:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And under every two branches a bud, made with the branch, for all the six branches of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The buds and the branches are to be made of the same metal; all together one complete work of hammered gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then you are to make its seven vessels for the lights, putting them in their place so that they give light in front of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the instruments and trays for use with it are all to be of the best gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A talent of gold will be needed for it, with all these vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And see that you make them from the design which you saw on the mountain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
