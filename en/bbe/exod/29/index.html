put the band of needlework round him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And let the head-dress be placed on his head and the holy crown on the head-dress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then take the oil and put it on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And take his sons and put their robes on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And put the linen bands round Aaron and his sons, and the head-dresses on them, to make them priests by my order for ever: so you are to make Aaron and his sons holy to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then let the ox be taken in front of the Tent of meeting: and let Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you are to put the ox to death before the Lord at the door of the Tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then take some of the blood of the ox, and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, draining out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And take all the fat covering the inside of the ox, and the fat joining the liver and the two kidneys with the fat round them, and let them be burned on the altar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the flesh of the ox and its skin and its waste parts are to be burned outside the circle of the tents, for it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then take one of the sheep, and let Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then let it be put to death, so that the sides of the altar are marked with its blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the sheep is to be cut up into its parts, and after washing its legs and its inside parts, you are to put them with the parts and the head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And let them all be burned on the altar as a burned offering to the Lord: a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then take the other sheep;

for by the offering of this sheep they are to be marked out as priests:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And take one bit of bread and one cake of oiled bread and one thin cake out of the basket of unleavened bread which is before the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And put them all on the hands of Aaron and of his sons, to be waved for a wave offering before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then take them from their hands, and let them be burned on the burned offering on the altar, a sweet smell before the Lord, an offering made by fire to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then take the breast of Aaron's sheep, waving it before the Lord;

it is not to be used for food, for it is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>All these things you are to do to Aaron and his sons as I have given you orders: for seven days the work of making them priests is to go on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Every day an ox is to be offered as a sin-offering, to take away sins: and by this offering on it, you will make the altar clean from sin; and you are to put oil on it and make it holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For seven days you are to make offerings for the altar and make it holy, so that it may become completely holy, and anything touching it will become holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now this is the offering which you are to make on the altar: two lambs in their first year, every day regularly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>One lamb is to be offered in the morning and the other in the evening:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with the one lamb, a tenth part of an ephah of the best meal, mixed with a fourth part of a hin of clear oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the other lamb is to be offered in the evening, and with it the same meal offering and drink offering, for a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>This is to be a regular burned offering made from generation to generation, at the door of the Tent of meeting before the Lord, where I will come face to face with you and have talk with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>There I will come face to face with the children of Israel, and the Tent will be made holy by my glory</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>I will make holy the Tent of meeting and the altar: and Aaron and his sons I will make holy, to be my priests</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Among the children of Israel I will make my living-place, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they will see that I am the Lord their God, who took them out of the land of Egypt, so that I might be ever with them: I am the Lord their God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
