And Moses said to them, It is the bread which the Lord has given you for your food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is what the Lord has said, Let every man take up as much as he has need of; at the rate of one omer for every person, let every man take as much as is needed for his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel did so, and some took more and some less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when it was measured, he who had taken up much had nothing over, and he who had little had enough; every man had taken what he was able to make use of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said to them, Let nothing be kept till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they gave no attention to Moses, and some of them kept it till the morning and there were worms in it and it had an evil smell: and Moses was angry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they took it up morning by morning, every man as he had need: and when the sun was high it was gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And on the sixth day they took up twice as much of the bread, two omers for every person: and all the rulers of the people gave Moses word of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, This is what the Lord has said, Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord: what has to be cooked may be cooked; and what is over, put on one side to be kept till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they kept it till the morning as Moses had said: and no smell came from it, and it had no worms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, Make your meal today of what you have, for this day is a Sabbath to the Lord: today you will not get any in the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For six days you will get it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But still on the seventh day some of the people went out to get it, and there was not any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the Lord said to Moses, How long will you go against my orders and my laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See, because the Lord has given you the Sabbath, he gives you on the sixth day bread enough for two days; let every man keep where he is; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the people took their rest on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And this bread was named manna by Israel: it was white, like a grain seed, and its taste was like cakes made with honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses said, This is the order which the Lord has given: Let one omer of it be kept for future generations, so that they may see the bread which I gave you for your food in the waste land, when I took you out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put one omer of manna in it, and put it away before the Lord, to be kept for future generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Aaron put it away in front of the holy chest to be kept, as the Lord gave orders to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel had manna for their food for forty years, till they came to a land with people in it, till they came to the edge of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
