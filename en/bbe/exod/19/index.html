These are the words which you are to say to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses came and sent for the chiefs of the people and put before them all these words which the Lord had given him orders to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people, answering together, said, Whatever the Lord has said we will do. And Moses took back to the Lord the words of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said to Moses, See, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that what I say to you may come to the ears of the people and they may have belief in you for ever. And Moses gave the Lord word of what the people had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Lord said to Moses, Go to the people and make them holy today and tomorrow, and let their clothing be washed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And by the third day let them be ready: for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai, before the eyes of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And let limits be marked out for the people round the mountain, and say to them, Take care not to go up the mountain or near the sides of it: whoever puts his foot on the mountain will certainly come to his death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He is not to be touched by a hand, but is to be stoned or have an arrow put through him; man or beast, he is to be put to death: at the long sounding of a horn they may come up to the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and made the people holy; and their clothing was washed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to the people, Be ready by the third day: do not come near a woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when morning came on the third day, there were thunders and flames and a thick cloud on the mountain, and a horn sounding very loud; and all the people in the tents were shaking with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses made the people come out of their tents and take their places before God; and they came to the foot of the mountain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all the mountain of Sinai was smoking, for the Lord had come down on it in fire: and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a great burning; and all the mountain was shaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the sound of the horn became louder and louder, Moses' words were answered by the voice of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the Lord came down on to Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and the Lord sent for Moses to come up to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lord said to Moses, Go down and give the people orders to keep back, for fear that a great number of them, forcing their way through to see the Lord, may come to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let the priests who come near to the Lord make themselves holy, for fear that the Lord may come on them suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said to the Lord, The people will not be able to come up the mountain, for you gave us orders to put limits round the mountain, marking it out and making it holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Lord said to him, Go down, and you and Aaron may come up; but let not the priests and the people make their way through to the Lord, or he will come on them suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down to the people and said this to them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
