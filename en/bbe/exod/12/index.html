its head with its legs and its inside parts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not keep any of it till the morning; anything which is not used is to be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And take your meal dressed as if for a journey, with your shoes on your feet and your sticks in your hands: take it quickly: it is the Lord's Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For on that night I will go through the land of Egypt, sending death on every first male child, of man and of beast, and judging all the gods of Egypt: I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are: when I see the blood I will go over you, and no evil will come on you for your destruction, when my hand is on the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this day is to be kept in your memories: you are to keep it as a feast to the Lord through all your generations, as an order for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For seven days let your food be unleavened bread; from the first day no leaven is to be seen in your houses: whoever takes bread with leaven in it, from the first till the seventh day, will be cut off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And on the first day there is to be a holy meeting and on the seventh day a holy meeting; no sort of work may be done on those days but only to make ready what is necessary for everyone's food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So keep the feast of unleavened bread; for on this very day I have taken your armies out of the land of Egypt: this day, then, is to be kept through all your generations by an order for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day, let your food be unleavened bread till the evening of the twenty-first day of the month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For seven days no leaven is to be seen in your houses: for whoever takes bread which is leavened will be cut off from the people of Israel, if he is from another country or if he is an Israelite by birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Take nothing which has leaven in it; wherever you are living let your food be unleavened cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses sent for the chiefs of Israel, and said to them, See that lambs are marked out for yourselves and your families, and let the Passover lamb be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And take some hyssop and put it in the blood in the basin, touching the two sides and the top of the doorway with the blood from the basin; and let not one of you go out of his house till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the Lord will go through the land, sending death on the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the two sides and the top of the door, the Lord will go over your door and will not let death come in for your destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you are to keep this as an order to you and to your sons for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when you come into the land which the Lord will make yours, as he gave his word, you are to keep this act of worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when your children say to you, What is the reason of this act of worship?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then you will say, This is the offering of the Lord's Passover; for he went over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he sent death on the Egyptians, and kept our families safe. And the people gave worship with bent heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the children of Israel went and did so; as the Lord had given orders to Moses and Aaron, so they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And in the middle of the night the Lord sent death on every first male child in the land of Egypt, from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the prisoner in the prison; and the first births of all the cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and a great cry went up from Egypt; for there was not a house where someone was not dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he sent for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Get up and go out from among my people, you and the children of Israel; go and give worship to the Lord as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And take your flocks and your herds as you have said, and be gone; and give me your blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Egyptians were forcing the people on, to get them out of the land quickly; for they said, We are all dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people took their bread-paste before it was leavened, putting their basins in their clothing on their backs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel had done as Moses had said; and they got from the Egyptians ornaments of silver and of gold, and clothing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Lord had given the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians so that they gave them whatever was requested. So they took away all their goods from the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the children of Israel made the journey from Rameses to Succoth; there were about six hundred thousand men on foot, as well as children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a mixed band of people went with them; and flocks and herds in great numbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they made unleavened cakes from the paste which they had taken out of Egypt; it was not leavened, for they had been sent out of Egypt so quickly, that they had no time to make any food ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now the children of Israel had been living in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the armies of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It is a watch-night before the Lord who took them out of the land of Egypt: this same night is a watch-night to the Lord for all the children of Israel, through all their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, This is the law of the Passover: no man who is not an Israelite is to take of it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But every man's servant, whom he has got for money, may take of it, when he has had circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A man from a strange country living among you, and a servant working for payment, may not take part in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>It is to be taken in one house; not a bit of the flesh is to be taken out of the house, and no bone of it may be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All Israel is to keep the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And if a man from another country is living with you, and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let all the males of his family undergo circumcision, and then let him come near and keep it; for he will then be as one of your people; but no one without circumcision may keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The law is the same for him who is an Israelite by birth and for the man from a strange country who is living with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So the children of Israel did as the Lord gave orders to Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And on that very day the Lord took the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
