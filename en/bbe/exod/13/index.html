say to him, By the strength of his hand the Lord took us out of Egypt, out of the prison-house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Pharaoh made his heart hard and would not let us go, the Lord sent death on all the first sons in Egypt, of man and of beast: and so every first male who comes to birth is offered to the Lord; but for all the first of my sons I give a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this will be for a sign on your hand and for a mark on your brow: for by the strength of his hand the Lord took us out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now after Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not take them through the land of the Philistines, though that was near: for God said, If the people see war, they may have a change of heart and go back to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But God took the people round by the waste land near the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up in fighting order out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly keep you in mind; and you are to take my bones away with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then they went on their journey from Succoth, and put up their tents in Etham at the edge of the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, guiding them on their way; and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light: so that they were able to go on day and night:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The pillar of cloud went ever before them by day, and the pillar of fire by night.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
