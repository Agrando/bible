For all the first of your sons you are to make payment. No one is to come before me without an offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Six days let work be done, but on the seventh day take your rest: at ploughing time and at the grain-cutting you are to have a day for rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you are to keep the feast of weeks when you get in the first-fruits of the grain, and the feast at the turn of the year when you take in the produce of your fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Three times in the year let all your males come before the Lord, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will send out the nations before you and make wide the limits of your land; and no man will make an attempt to take your land while you go up to give worship to the Lord, three times in the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>No leaven is to be offered with the blood of my offering, and the offering of the Passover feast may not be kept till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Take the first-fruits of your land as an offering to the house of the Lord your God. Let not the young goat be cooked in its mother's milk</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Lord said to Moses, Put all these words in writing; for on them is based the agreement which I will make with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And for forty days and forty nights Moses was there with the Lord, and in that time he had no food or drink. And he put in writing on the stones the words of the agreement, the ten rules of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two stones in his hand, he was not conscious that his face was shining because of his talk with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and the shining of his face, they would not come near him for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Moses sent for them; and Aaron, with the chiefs of the people, came to him; and Moses had talk with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And later, all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all the orders which the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And at the end of his talk with them, Moses put a veil over his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But whenever Moses went in before the Lord to have talk with him, he took off the veil till he came out. And whenever he came out he said to the children of Israel what he had been ordered to say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel saw that the face of Moses was shining: so Moses put the veil over his face again till he went to the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
