And so he went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long is this man to be the cause of evil to us? let the men go so that they may give worship to the Lord their God: are you not awake to Egypt's danger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Moses and Aaron came in again before Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go and give worship to the Lord your God: but which of you are going?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said, We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds; for we are to keep a feast to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, May the Lord be with you, if I will let you and your little ones go! take care, for your purpose clearly is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not so; but let your males go and give worship to the Lord, as your desire is. This he said, driving them out from before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out over the land of Egypt so that the locusts may come up on the land for the destruction of every green plant in the land, even everything untouched by the ice-storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses' rod was stretched out over the land of Egypt, and the Lord sent an east wind over the land all that day and all the night; and in the morning the locusts came up with the east wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, resting on every part of the land, in very great numbers; such an army of locusts had never been seen before, and never will be again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For all the face of the earth was covered with them, so that the land was black; and every green plant and all the fruit of the trees which was untouched by the ice-storm they took for food: not one green thing, no plant or tree, was to be seen in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron, and said, I have done evil against the Lord your God and against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let me now have forgiveness for my sin this time only, and make prayer to the Lord your God that he will take away from me this death only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Lord sent a very strong west wind, which took up the locusts, driving them into the Red Sea; not one locust was to be seen in any part of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he did not let the children of Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out to heaven, and all the land of Egypt will be dark, so that men will be feeling their way about in the dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Moses' hand was stretched out, dark night came over all the land of Egypt for three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They were not able to see one another, and no one got up from his place for three days: but where the children of Israel were living it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Pharaoh sent for Moses, and said, Go and give worship to the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be kept here: your little ones may go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Moses said, You will have to let us take burned offerings to put before the Lord our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So our cattle will have to go with us, not one may be kept back; for they are needed for the worship of the Lord our God; we have no knowledge what offering we have to give till we come to the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he would not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said to him, Go away from me, take care that you come not again before me; for the day when you see my face again will be your last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, You say truly; I will not see your face again.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
