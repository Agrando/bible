What is the wrongdoing of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So I will make Samaria into a field and the plantings of a vine-garden: I will send its stones falling down into the valley, uncovering its bases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all her pictured images will be hammered into bits, and all the payments for her loose ways will be burned with fire, and all the images of her gods I will make waste: for with the price of a loose woman she got them together, and as the price of a loose woman will they be given back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this I will be full of sorrow and give cries of grief; I will go uncovered and unclothed: I will give cries of grief like the jackals and will be in sorrow like the ostriches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For her wounds may not be made well: for it has come even to Judah, stretching up to the doorway of my people, even to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Give no word of it in Gath, let there be no weeping at all: at Beth-le-aphrah be rolling in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Be uncovered and go away, you who are living in Shaphir: the one living in Zaanan has not come out of her town; Beth-ezel is taken away from its base, even from its resting-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the one living in Maroth is waiting for good: for evil has come down from the Lord to the doorways of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let the war-carriage be yoked to the quick-running horse, you who are living in Lachish: she was the first cause of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the wrongdoings of Israel were seen in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this cause give a parting offering to Moresheth-gath: the daughter of Achzib will be a deceit to the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Even now will the taker of your heritage come to you, you who are living in Mareshah: the glory of Israel will come to destruction for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your head be uncovered and your hair cut off in sorrow for the children of your delight: let the hair be pulled from your head like an eagle's; for they have been taken away from you as prisoners.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
