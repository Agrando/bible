give hearing equally to small and great; have no fear of any man, for it is God who is judge: and any cause in which you are not able to give a decision, you are to put before me and I will give it a hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And at that time I gave you all the orders which you were to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then we went on from Horeb, through all that great and cruel waste which you saw, on our way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as the Lord gave us orders; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I said to you, You have come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>See now, the Lord your God has put the land into your hands: go up and take it, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has said to you; have no fear and do not be troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you came near to me, every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us to go through the land with care and give us an account of the way we are to go and the towns to which we will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And what you said seemed good to me, and I took twelve men from among you, one from every tribe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they went up into the hill-country and came to the valley of Eshcol, and saw what was there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And taking in their hands some of the fruit of the land, they came down again to us, and gave us their account, saying, It is a good land which the Lord our God is giving us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But going against the order of the Lord your God, you would not go up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you made an angry outcry in your tents, and said, In his hate for us the Lord has taken us out of the land of Egypt, to give us up into the hands of the Amorites for our destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts feeble with fear by saying, The people are greater and taller than we are, and the towns are great and walled up to heaven; and more than this, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then I said to you, Have no fear of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The Lord your God who goes before you will be fighting for you, and will do such wonders as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And in the waste land, where you have seen how the Lord was supporting you, as a man does his son, in all your journeying till you came to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But for all this, you had no faith in the Lord your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who goes before you on your way, looking for a place where you may put up your tents, in fire by night, lighting up the way you are to go, and in a cloud by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the Lord, hearing your words, was angry, and said with an oath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Truly, not one of this evil generation will see that good land which I said I would give to your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But only Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he will see it; and to him and to his children I will give the land over which his feet have gone, because he has been true to the Lord with all his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, in addition, the Lord was angry with me because of you, saying, You yourself will not go into it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joshua, the son of Nun, your servant, he will go into the land: say to him that he is to be strong, for he will be Israel's guide into their heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And your little ones, who, you said, would come into strange hands, your children, who now have no knowledge of good or evil, they will go into that land, and to them I will give it and it will be theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But as for you, go back, journeying into the waste land by the way of the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then you said to me, We have done evil against the Lord, we will go up to the attack, as the Lord our God has given us orders. And arming yourselves every one, you made ready to go up without care into the hill-country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said to me, Say to them, Do not go up to the attack; for I am not among you, and you will be overcome by those who are against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>This I said to you, but you gave no attention and went against the orders of the Lord, and in your pride went up into the hill-country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Amorites who were in the hill-country came out against you and put you to flight, rushing after you like bees, and overcame you in Seir, driving you even as far as Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And you came back, weeping before the Lord; but the Lord gave no attention to your cries and did not give ear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So you were kept waiting in Kadesh for a long time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
