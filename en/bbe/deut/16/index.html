for seven days let your food be unleavened bread, that is, the bread of sorrow; for you came out of the land of Egypt quickly: so the memory of that day, when you came out of the land of Egypt, will be with you all your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For seven days let no leaven be used through all your land; and nothing of the flesh which is put to death in the evening of the first day is to be kept through the night till morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Passover offering is not to be put to death in any of the towns which the Lord your God gives you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But in the place marked out by the Lord your God as the resting-place of his name, there you are to put the Passover to death in the evening, at sundown, at that time of the year when you came out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It is to be cooked and taken as food in the place marked out by the Lord: and in the morning you are to go back to your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For six days let your food be unleavened bread; and on the seventh day there is to be a holy meeting to the Lord your God; no work is to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let seven weeks be numbered from the first day when the grain is cut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then keep the feast of weeks to the Lord your God, with an offering freely given to him from the wealth he has given you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then you are to be glad before the Lord your God, you and your son and your daughter, your man-servant and your woman-servant, and the Levite who is with you, and the man from a strange country, and the child without a father, and the widow, who are living among you, in the place marked out by the Lord your God as a resting-place for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you will keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt: and you will take care to keep all these laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You are to keep the feast of tents for seven days after you have got in all your grain and made your wine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are to keep the feast with joy, you and your son and your daughter, your man-servant and your woman-servant, and the Levite, and the man from a strange country, and the child without a father, and the widow, who are living among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Keep the feast to the Lord your God for seven days, in the place marked out by the Lord: because the blessing of the Lord your God will be on all the produce of your land and all the work of your hands, and you will have nothing but joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Three times in the year let all your males come before the Lord your God in the place named by him;
