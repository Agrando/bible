Then they will no longer be responsible for the man's death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So you will take away the crime of a death without cause from among you, when you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you go out to war against other nations, and the Lord your God gives them up into your hands and you take them as prisoners;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If among the prisoners you see a beautiful woman and it is your desire to make her your wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then take her back to your house; and let her hair and her nails be cut;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And let her take off the dress in which she was made prisoner and go on living in your house and weeping for her father and mother for a full month: and after that you may go in to her and be her husband and she will be your wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have no delight in her, you are to let her go wherever she will; you may not take a price for her as if she was your property, for you have made use of her for your pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a man has two wives, one greatly loved and the other hated, and the two of them have had children by him; and if the first son is the child of the hated wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then when he gives his property to his sons for their heritage, he is not to put the son of his loved one in the place of the first son, the son of the hated wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he is to give his first son his birthright, and twice as great a part of his property: for he is the first-fruits of his strength and the right of the first son is his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If a man has a son who is hard-hearted and uncontrolled, who gives no attention to the voice of his father and mother, and will not be ruled by them, though they give him punishment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then let his father and mother take him to the responsible men of the town, to the public place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And say to them, This son of ours is hard-hearted and uncontrolled, he will not give attention to us; he gives himself up to pleasure and strong drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he is to be stoned to death by all the men of the town: so you are to put away the evil from among you; and all Israel, hearing of it, will be full of fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If a man does a crime for which the punishment is death, and he is put to death by hanging him on a tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do not let his body be on the tree all night, but put it to rest in the earth the same day; for the man who undergoes hanging is cursed by God; so do not make unclean the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
