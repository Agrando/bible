It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide, measured by the common cubit.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this land which we took at that time, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead with its towns, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, all the land of Argob, together with Bashan, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This land is named the land of the Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the land of Argob, as far as the country of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, naming it, Bashan, Havvoth-Jair after himself, as it is to this day.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Gilead I gave to Machir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the land from Gilead to the valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a limit, as far as the river Jabbok which is the limit of the country of the children of Ammon, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As well as the Arabah, with the river Jordan as their limit, from Chinnereth to the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah to the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At that time I gave you orders, saying, The Lord has given you this land for your heritage: all the men of war are to go over armed before your brothers the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But your wives and your little ones and your cattle (for it is clear that you have much cattle) may go on living in the towns I have given you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Till the Lord has given rest to your brothers as to you, and till they have taken for themselves the land which the Lord your God is giving them on the other side of Jordan: then you may go back, every man of you, to the heritage which I have given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave orders to Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen what the Lord your God has done to these two kings: so will the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Have no fear of them, for the Lord your God will be fighting for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And at that time I made request to the Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O Lord God, you have now for the first time let your servant see your great power and the strength of your hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth able to do such great works and such acts of power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let me go over, O Lord, and see the good land on the other side of Jordan, and that fair mountain country, even Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not give ear to my prayer; and the Lord said to me, Let it be enough, say no more about this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and turning your eyes to the west and the north, to the south and the east, see the land with your eyes: for you are not to go over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But give my orders to Joshua, comforting him and making him strong; for he is to go over Jordan at the head of this people, and he will give them this land which you will see for their heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So we were waiting in the valley facing Beth-peor.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
