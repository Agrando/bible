So Moses and Joshua went to the Tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord was seen in the Tent in a pillar of cloud resting by the door of the Tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Lord said to Moses, Now you are going to rest with your fathers; and this people will be false to me, uniting themselves to the strange gods of the land where they are going; they will be turned away from me and will not keep the agreement I have made with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In that day my wrath will be moved against them, and I will be turned away from them, veiling my face from them, and destruction will overtake them, and unnumbered evils and troubles will come on them; so that in that day they will say, Have not these evils come on us because our God is not with us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly, my face will be turned away from them in that day, because of all the evil they have done in going after other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Make then this song for yourselves, teaching it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when I have taken them into the land named in my oath to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey, and they have made themselves full of food and are fat, then they will be turned to other gods and will give them worship, no longer honouring me or keeping my agreement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then when evils and troubles without number have overtaken them, this song will be a witness to them, for the words of it will be clear in the memories of their children: for I see the thoughts which are moving in their hearts even now, before I have taken them into the land of my oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that same day Moses made this song, teaching it to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he gave orders to Joshua, the son of Nun, saying to him, Be strong and take heart: for you are to go at the head of the children of Israel into the land which I made an oath to give them; and I will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now after writing all the words of this law in a book till the record of them was complete,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Moses said to the Levites who were responsible for taking up the ark of the Lord's agreement,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Take this book of the law and put it by the ark of the Lord's agreement, so that it may be a witness against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I have knowledge of your hard and uncontrolled hearts: even now, while I am still living, you will not be ruled by the Lord; how much less after my death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Get together before me all those who are in authority in your tribes, and your overseers, so that I may say these things in their hearing, and make heaven and earth my witnesses against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I am certain that after my death you will give yourselves up to sin, wandering from the way which I have given you; and evil will overtake you in the end, because you will do evil in the eyes of the Lord, moving him to wrath by the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then in the hearing of all the meeting of Israel, Moses said the words of this song, to the end.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
