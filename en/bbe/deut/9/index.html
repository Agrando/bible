But again the Lord's ear was open to my prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord, in his wrath, would have put Aaron to death: and I made prayer for Aaron at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I took your sin, the image which you had made, and put it in the fire and had it hammered and crushed very small till it was only dust: and the dust I put in the stream flowing down from the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you made the Lord angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and take the land which I have given you; you went against the orders of the Lord your God, and had no faith in him, and would not give ear to his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From the day when I first had knowledge of you, you have gone against the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So I went down on my face in prayer before the Lord for forty days and forty nights as I did at first; because the Lord had said that he would put an end to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I made prayer to the Lord and said, O Lord God, do not send destruction on your people and your heritage, to whom, by your great power, you have given salvation, whom you have taken out of Egypt by the strength of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Keep in mind your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not looking at the hard heart of this people, or their evil-doing and their sin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Or it may be said in the land from which you have taken them, Because the Lord was not able to take them into the land which he said he would give them, and because of his hate for them, he has taken them out to put them to death in the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But still they are your people and your heritage, whom you took out by your great power and by your stretched-out arm.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
