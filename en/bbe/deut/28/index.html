and you will ever have the highest place, if you give ear to the orders of the Lord your God which I give you today, to keep and to do them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Not turning away from any of the orders which I give you today, to the right hand or to the left, or going after any other gods to give them worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you do not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, and take care to do all his orders and his laws which I give you today, then all these curses will come on you and overtake you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will be cursed in the town and cursed in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A curse will be on your basket and on your bread-basin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A curse will be on the fruit of your body, and on the fruit of your land, on the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Lord will send on you cursing and trouble and punishment in everything to which you put your hand, till sudden destruction overtakes you; because of your evil ways in which you have been false to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Lord will send disease after disease on you, till you have been cut off by death from the land to which you are going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Lord will send wasting disease, and burning pain, and flaming heat against you, keeping back the rain till your land is waste and dead; so will it be till your destruction is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the heaven over your heads will be brass, and the earth under you hard as iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Lord will make the rain of your land powder and dust, sending it down on you from heaven till your destruction is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Lord will let you be overcome by your haters: you will go out against them one way, and you will go in flight before them seven ways: you will be the cause of fear among all the kingdoms of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Your bodies will be meat for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth; there will be no one to send them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The Lord will send on you the disease of Egypt, and other sorts of skin diseases which nothing will make well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He will make your minds diseased, and your eyes blind, and your hearts wasted with fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You will go feeling your way when the sun is high, like a blind man for whom all is dark, and nothing will go well for you: you will be crushed and made poor for ever, and you will have no saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>You will take a wife, but another man will have the use of her: the house which your hands have made will never be your resting-place: you will make a vine-garden, and never take the fruit of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Your ox will be put to death before your eyes, but its flesh will not be your food: your ass will be violently taken away before your face, and will not be given back to you: your sheep will be given to your haters, and there will be no saviour for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people, and your eyes will be wasted away with looking and weeping for them all the day: and you will have no power to do anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The fruit of your land and all the work of your hands will be food for a nation which is strange to you and to your fathers; you will only be crushed down and kept under for ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So that the things which your eyes have to see will send you out of your minds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Lord will send a skin disease, attacking your knees and your legs, bursting out from your feet to the top of your head, so that nothing will make you well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And you, and the king whom you have put over you, will the Lord take away to a nation strange to you and to your fathers; there you will be servants to other gods of wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And you will become a wonder and a name of shame among all the nations where the Lord will take you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>You will take much seed out into the field, and get little in; for the locust will get it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You will put in vines and take care of them, but you will get no wine or grapes from them; for they will be food for worms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Your land will be full of olive-trees, but there will be no oil for the comfort of your body; for your olive-tree will give no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You will have sons and daughters, but they will not be yours; for they will go away prisoners into a strange land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All your trees and the fruit of your land will be the locust's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The man from a strange land who is living among you will be lifted up higher and higher over you, while you go down lower and lower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He will let you have his wealth at interest, and will have no need of yours: he will be the head and you the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And all these curses will come after you and overtake you, till your destruction is complete; because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, or keep his laws and his orders which he gave you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These things will come on you and on your seed, to be a sign and a wonder for ever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Because you did not give honour to the Lord your God, worshipping him gladly, with joy in your hearts on account of all your wealth of good things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For this cause you will become servants to those whom the Lord your God will send against you, without food and drink and clothing, and in need of all things: and he will put a yoke of iron on your neck till he has put an end to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The Lord will send a nation against you from the farthest ends of the earth, coming with the flight of an eagle; a nation whose language is strange to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>A hard-faced nation, who will have no respect for the old or mercy for the young:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He will take the fruit of your cattle and of your land till death puts an end to you: he will let you have nothing of your grain or wine or oil or any of the increase of your cattle or the young of your flock, till he has made your destruction complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Your towns will be shut in by his armies, till your high walls, in which you put your faith, have come down: his armies will be round your towns, through all your land which the Lord your God has given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And your food will be the fruit of your body, the flesh of the sons and daughters which the Lord your God has given you; because of your bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>That man among you who is soft and used to comfort will be hard and cruel to his brother, and to his dear wife, and to of those his children who are still living;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And will not give to any of them the flesh of his children which will be his food because he has no other; in the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The most soft and delicate of your women, who would not so much as put her foot on the earth, so delicate is she, will be hard-hearted to her husband and to her son and to her daughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And to her baby newly come to birth, and to the children of her body; for having no other food, she will make a meal of them secretly, because of her bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If you will not take care to do all the words of this law, recorded in this book, honouring that name of glory and of fear, THE LORD YOUR GOD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then the Lord your God will make your punishment, and the punishment of your seed, a thing to be wondered at; great punishments and cruel diseases stretching on through long years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>He will send on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which were a cause of fear to you, and they will take you in their grip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And all the diseases and the pains not recorded in the book of this law will the Lord send on you till your destruction is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And you will become a very small band, though your numbers were like the stars of heaven; because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And as the Lord took delight in doing you good and increasing you, so the Lord will take pleasure in cutting you off and causing your destruction, and you will be uprooted from the land which you are about to take as your heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And the Lord will send you wandering among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other: there you will be servants to other gods, of wood and stone, gods of which you and your fathers had no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And even among these nations there will be no peace for you, and no rest for your feet: but the Lord will give you there a shaking heart and wasting eyes and weariness of soul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Your very life will be hanging in doubt before you, and day and night will be dark with fears, and nothing in life will be certain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning you will say, If only it was evening! And at evening you will say, If only morning would come! Because of the fear in your hearts and the things which your eyes will see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And the Lord will take you back to Egypt again in ships, by the way of which I said to you, You will never see it again: there you will be offering yourselves as men-servants and women-servants to your haters for a price, and no man will take you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
