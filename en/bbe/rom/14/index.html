Yes, his place will be safe, because the Lord is able to keep him from falling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>This man puts one day before another: to that man they are the same. Let every man be certain in his mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who keeps the day, keeps it to the Lord; and he who takes food, takes it as to the Lord, for he gives praise to God; and he who does not take food, to the Lord he takes it not, and gives praise to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every man's life and every man's death has a relation to others as well as to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As long as we have life we are living to the Lord; or if we give up our life it is to the Lord; so if we are living, or if our life comes to an end, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And for this purpose Christ went into death and came back again, that he might be the Lord of the dead and of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But you, why do you make yourself your brother's judge? or again, why have you no respect for your brother? because we will all have to take our place before God as our judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is said in the holy Writings, By my life, says the Lord, to me every knee will be bent, and every tongue will give worship to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So every one of us will have to give an account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then let us not be judges of one another any longer: but keep this in mind, that no man is to make it hard for his brother, or give him cause for doubting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am conscious of this, and am certain in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself; but for the man in whose opinion it is unclean, for him it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if because of food your brother is troubled, then you are no longer going on in the way of love. Do not let your food be destruction to him for whom Christ went into death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let it not be possible for men to say evil about your good:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he who in these things is Christ's servant, is pleasing to God and has the approval of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then, let us go after the things which make peace, and the things by which we may be a help to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not let the work of God come to nothing on account of food. All things are certainly clean; but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is better not to take meat or wine or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The faith which you have, have it to yourself before God. Happy is the man who is not judged by that to which he gives approval.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who is in doubt is judged if he takes food, because he does it not in faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
