(that is, to make Christ come down:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Or, Who will go down into the deep? (that is, to make Christ come again from the dead:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart: that is, the word of faith of which we are the preachers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because, if you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and have faith in your heart that God has made him come back from the dead, you will have salvation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with the heart man has faith to get righteousness, and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Jew is not different from the Greek: for there is the same Lord of all, who is good to all who have hope in his name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because, Whoever will give worship to the name of the Lord will get salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith? and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news? and how will they have news without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how will there be preachers if they are not sent? As it is said, How beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they have not all given ear to the good news. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has had faith in our word?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, Did not the word come to their ears? Yes, certainly: Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Had Israel no knowledge? First Moses says, You will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation, and by a foolish people I will make you angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaiah says without fear, Those who were not searching for me made discovery of me; and I was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But about Israel he says; All the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away, and who put themselves against my word.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
