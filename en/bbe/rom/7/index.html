But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law: for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said, You may not have a desire for what is another's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there was a time when I was living without the law: but when the law gave its orders, sin came to life and put me to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I was tricked and put to death by sin, which took its chance through the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the law is holy, and its orders are holy, upright, and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Was then that which is good, death to me? In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, if I do that which I have no mind to do, I am in agreement with the law that the law is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I am conscious that in me, that is, in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to do what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good which I have a mind to do, I do not: but the evil which I have no mind to do, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I do what I have no mind to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So I see a law that, though I have a mind to do good, evil is present in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I see another law in my body, working against the law of my mind, and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>How unhappy am I! who will make me free from the body of this death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God, but with my flesh to the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
