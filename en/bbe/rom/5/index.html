For if, by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men, much more did the grace of God, and the free giving by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, come to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one: for the effect of one man's sin was punishment by the decision of God, but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, if by the wrongdoing of one, death was ruling through the one, much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness, be ruling in life through the one, even Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then, as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men, even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because, as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man, even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the law came in addition, to make wrongdoing worse; but where there was much sin, there was much more grace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That, as sin had power in death, so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
