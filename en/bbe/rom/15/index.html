as it is said, For this reason I will give praise to you among the Gentiles, and I will make a song to your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And again he says, Take part, you Gentiles, in the joy of his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again, Give praise to the Lord, all you Gentiles; and let all the nations give praise to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again Isaiah says, There will be the root of Jesse, and he who comes to be the ruler over the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles put their hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now may the God of hope make you full of joy and peace through faith, so that all hope may be yours in the power of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I myself am certain of you, brothers, that you are full of what is good, complete in all knowledge, able to give direction to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have, in some measure, less fear in writing to you to put these things before you again, because of the grace which was given to me by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, doing the work of a priest in the good news of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be pleasing to God, being made holy by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So I have pride in Christ Jesus in the things which are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will keep myself from talking of anything but those things which Christ has done by me to put the Gentiles under his rule in word and in act,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have given all the good news of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Making it my purpose not to take the good news where Christ was named, so that my work might not be resting on that of others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as it is said in the holy Writings, They will see, to whom the news of him had not been given, and those to whose ears it had not come will have knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For which reason I was frequently kept from coming to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now, having no longer any place in these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whenever I go to Spain (for it is my hope to see you on my way, and to be sent on there by you, if first I may in some measure have been comforted by your company)--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I go to Jerusalem, taking help for the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it has been the good pleasure of those of Macedonia and Achaia to send a certain amount of money for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yes, it has been their good pleasure; and they are in their debt. For if the Gentiles have had a part in the things of the Spirit which were theirs, it is right for them, in the same way, to give them help in the things of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So when I have done this, and have given them this fruit of love, I will go on by you into Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I am certain that when I come, I will be full of the blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I make request to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you will be working together with me in your prayers to God for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that I may be kept safe from those in Judaea who have not put themselves under the rule of God, and that the help which I am taking for Jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So that I may come to you in joy by the good pleasure of God, and have rest with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now may the God of peace be with you all. So be it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
