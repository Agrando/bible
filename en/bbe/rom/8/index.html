But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you, he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way, through his Spirit which is in you, give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, my brothers, we are in debt, not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if you go in the way of the flesh, death will come on you; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body, you will have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear, but the spirit of sons was given to you, by which we say, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if we are children, we have a right to a part in the heritage; a part in the things of God, together with Christ; so that if we have a part in his pain, we will in the same way have a part in his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For every living thing was put under the power of change, not by its desire, but by him who made it so, in hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of God in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only so, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we have sorrow in our minds, waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons, that is, the salvation of our bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For our salvation is by hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: for who is hoping for what he sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we have hope for that which we see not, then we will be able to go on waiting for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit, because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been marked out by his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence, were marked out by him to be made like his Son, so that he might be the first among a band of brothers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And those who were marked out by him were named; and those who were named were given righteousness; and to those to whom he gave righteousness, in the same way he gave glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What may we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who did not keep back his only Son, but gave him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who will say anything against the saints of God? It is God who makes us clear from evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who will give a decision against us? It is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death, but came again from the dead, who is now at the right hand of God, taking our part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who will come between us and the love of Christ? Will trouble, or pain, or cruel acts, or the need of food or of clothing, or danger, or the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As it is said in the holy Writings, Because of you we are put to death every day; we are like sheep ready for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am certain that not death, or life, or angels, or rulers, or things present, or things to come, or powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Or things on high, or things under the earth, or anything which is made, will be able to come between us and the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
