In no way: because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks are all under the power of sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it is said in the holy Writings, There is not one who does righteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not one who has the knowledge of what is right, not one who is a searcher after God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have all gone out of the way, there is no profit in any of them; there is not one who does good, not so much as one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is like an open place of death; with their tongues they have said what is not true: the poison of snakes is under their lips:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are quick in running after blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and trouble are in their ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And of the way of peace they have no knowledge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all men may be judged by God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of God, to which witness is given by the law and the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, to all those who have faith; and one man is not different from another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all have done wrong and are far from the glory of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they may have righteousness put to their credit, freely, by his grace, through the salvation which is in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy, through faith, by his blood, to make clear his righteousness when, in his pity, God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to make clear his righteousness now, so that he might himself be upright, and give righteousness to him who has faith in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What reason, then, is there for pride? It is shut out. By what sort of law? of works? No, but by a law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this reason, then, a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not in the same way the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If God is one; and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision, and through faith to those who have not circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we, then, through faith make the law of no effect? in no way: but we make it clear that the law is important.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
