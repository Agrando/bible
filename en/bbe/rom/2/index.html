you who say that a man may not take what is not his, do you take what is not yours?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife, are you true to yours? you who are a hater of images, do you do wrong to the house of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You who take pride in the law, are you doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the name of God is shamed among the Gentiles because of you, as it is said in the holy Writings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law, but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law, will it not be credited to them as circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they, by their keeping of the law without circumcision, will be judges of you, by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The true Jew is not one who is only so publicly, and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he is a Jew who is a secret one, whose circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
