Be haters of what is evil; keep your minds fixed on what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be kind to one another with a brother's love, putting others before yourselves in honour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Be not slow in your work, but be quick in spirit, as the Lord's servants;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Being glad in hope, quiet in trouble, at all times given to prayer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Giving to the needs of the saints, ready to take people into your houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Take part in the joy of those who are glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be in harmony with one another.
