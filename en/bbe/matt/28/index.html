Come, see the Lord's resting-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as I have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went away quickly, with fear and great joy, to give his disciples the news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And on the way, Jesus came to them, saying, Be glad. And they came and put their hands on his feet, and gave him worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said Jesus to them, Have no fear: go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee, and there they will see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, while they were going, some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they had come together with those in authority, and had made their decision, they gave much money to the watchmen, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Say, His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this comes to the ruler's ears, we will see that he does not make you responsible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money, and did as they had been ordered: and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him they gave him worship: but some were in doubt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came to them and said, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go then, and make disciples of all the nations, giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you: and see, I am ever with you, even to the end of the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
