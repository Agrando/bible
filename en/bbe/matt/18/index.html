if a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone wandering away, will he not let the ninety-nine be, and go to the mountains in search of the wandering one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he comes across it, truly I say to you, he has more joy over it than over the ninety-nine which have not gone out of the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so it is not the pleasure of your Father in heaven for one of these little ones to come to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if your brother does wrong to you, go, make clear to him his error between you and him in private: if he gives ear to you, you have got your brother back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he will not give ear to you, take with you one or two more, that by the lips of two or three witnesses every word may be made certain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he will not give ear to them, let it come to the hearing of the church: and if he will not give ear to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax-farmer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly I say to you, Whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven: and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, I say to you, that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are come together in my name, there am I among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter came and said to him, Lord, what number of times may my brother do wrong against me, and I give him forgiveness? till seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus says to him, I say not to you, Till seven times; but, Till seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For this reason the kingdom of heaven is like a king, who went over his accounts with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And at the start, one came to him who was in his debt for ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And because he was not able to make payment, his lord gave orders for him, and his wife, and his sons and daughters, and all he had, to be given for money, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the servant went down on his face and gave him worship, saying, Lord, give me time to make payment and I will give you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the lord of that servant, being moved with pity, let him go, and made him free of the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But that servant went out, and meeting one of the other servants, who was in debt to him for one hundred pence, he took him by the throat, saying, Make payment of your debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So that servant went down on his face, requesting him and saying, Give me time and I will make payment to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he would not: but went and put him into prison till he had made payment of the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So when the other servants saw what was done they were very sad, and came and gave word to their lord of what had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord sent for him and said, You evil servant; I made you free of all that debt, because of your request to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Was it not right for you to have mercy on the other servant, even as I had mercy on you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his lord was very angry, and put him in the hands of those who would give him punishment till he made payment of all the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So will my Father in heaven do to you, if you do not everyone, from your hearts, give forgiveness to his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
