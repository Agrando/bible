And they were very sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had come to Capernaum, those who took the Temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your master make payment of the Temple tax?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus said to him, What is your opinion, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax? from their sons or from other people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he said, From other people, Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them, go to the sea, and let down a hook, and take the first fish which comes up; and in his mouth you will see a bit of money: take that, and give it to them for me and you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
