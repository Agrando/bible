Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so, every good tree gives good fruit; but the bad tree gives evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is not possible for a good tree to give bad fruit, and a bad tree will not give good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So by their fruits you will get knowledge of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will go into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the pleasure of my Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A great number will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, were we not prophets in your name, and did we not by your name send out evil spirits, and by your name do works of power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then will I say to them, I never had knowledge of you: go from me, you workers of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Everyone, then, to whom my words come and who does them, will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house, but it was not moved; because it was based on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And everyone to whom my words come and who does them not, will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house; and it came down and great was its fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came about, when Jesus had come to the end of these words, that the people were surprised at his teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he was teaching as one having authority, and not as their scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
