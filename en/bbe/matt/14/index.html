he has come back from the dead, and so these powers are working in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Herod had taken John and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because John had said to him, It is not right for you to have her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he would have put him to death, but for his fear of the people, because in their eyes John was a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias was dancing before them, and Herod was pleased with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And she, at her mother's suggestion, said, Give me here on a plate the head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king was sad; but because of his oaths and because of his guests, he gave the order for it to be given to her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he sent and had John's head cut off in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his head was put on a plate and given to the girl; and she took it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his disciples came, and took up his body and put it in the earth; and they went and gave Jesus news of what had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when it came to the ears of Jesus, he went away from there in a boat, to a waste place by himself: and the people hearing of it, went after him on foot from the towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he came out and saw a great number of people and he had pity on them, and made well those of them who were ill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when evening had come, the disciples came to him, saying, This place is waste land, and the time is now past; send the people away so that they may go into the towns and get themselves food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them, There is no need for them to go away; give them food yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they say to him, We have here but five cakes of bread and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Give them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he gave orders for the people to be seated on the grass; and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing, and made division of the food, and gave it to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all took of the food and had enough: and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And those who had food were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, till he had sent the people away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had sent the people away, he went up into the mountain by himself for prayer: and when evening was come, he was there by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, and was troubled by the waves: for the wind was against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when they saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they gave cries of fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But straight away Jesus said to them, Take heart; it is I, have no fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter, answering, said to him, Lord, if it is you, give me the order to come to you on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Come. And Peter got out of the boat, and walking on the water, went to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he saw the wind he was in fear and, starting to go down, he gave a cry, saying, Help, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And straight away Jesus put out his hand and took a grip of him, and said to him, O man of little faith, why were you in doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they had got into the boat, the wind went down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those who were in the boat gave him worship, saying, Truly you are the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when they had gone across, they came to land at Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place had news of him, they sent into all the country round about, and took to him all who were ill,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>With the request that they might only put their hands on the edge of his robe: and all those who did so were made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
