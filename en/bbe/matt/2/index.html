We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when it came to the ears of Herod the king, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, questioning them as to where the birth-place of the Christ would be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they said to him, In Beth-lehem of Judaea; for so it is said in the writings of the prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You Beth-lehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the chiefs of Judah: out of you will come a ruler, who will be the keeper of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod sent for the wise men privately, and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he sent them to Beth-lehem and said, Go and make certain where the young child is; and when you have seen him, let me have news of it, so that I may come and give him worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And after hearing the king, they went on their way; and the star which they saw in the east went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the young child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they saw the star they were full of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they came into the house, and saw the young child with Mary, his mother; and falling down on their faces they gave him worship; and from their store they gave him offerings of gold, perfume, and spices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it was made clear to them by God in a dream that they were not to go back to Herod; so they went into their country by another way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had gone, an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream, saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into Egypt, and do not go from there till I give you word; for Herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he took the young child and his mother by night, and went into Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And was there till the death of Herod; so that the word of the Lord through the prophet might come true, Out of Egypt have I sent for my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was very angry; and he sent out, and put to death all the male children in Beth-lehem and in all the parts round about it, from two years old and under, acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In Ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted for their loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord came in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: because they who were attempting to take the young child's life are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he got up, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when it came to his ears that Archelaus was ruling over Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was in fear of going there; and God having given him news of the danger in a dream, he went out of the way into the country parts of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth: so that the word of the prophets might come true, He will be named a Nazarene.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
