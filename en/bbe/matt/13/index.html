He is the seed dropped by the wayside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And that which went on the stones, this is he who, hearing the word, straight away takes it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But having no root in himself, he goes on for a time; and when trouble comes or pain, because of the word, he quickly becomes full of doubts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And that which was dropped among the thorns, this is he who has the word; and the cares of this life, and the deceits of wealth, put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the seed which was put in good earth, this is he who gives ear to the word, and gets the sense of it; who gives fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times as much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gave them another story, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who put good seed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But while men were sleeping, one who had hate for him came and put evil seeds among the grain, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the green stem came up and gave fruit, the evil plants were seen at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not put good seed in your field? how then has it evil plants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Someone has done this in hate. And the servants say to him, Is it your pleasure that we go and take them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he says, No, for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants, you may be rooting up the grain with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let them come up together till the getting in of the grain; and then I will say to the workers, Take up first the evil plants, and put them together for burning: but put the grain into my store-house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He put another story before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Which is smaller than all seeds; but when it has come up it is greater than the plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and make their resting-places in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another story he gave to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and put in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things Jesus said to the people in the form of stories; and without a story he said nothing to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That it might come true which was said by the prophet, Opening my mouth, I will give out stories; I will give knowledge of things kept secret from before all time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he went away from the people, and went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Make clear to us the story of the evil plants in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he made answer and said, He who puts the good seed in the earth is the Son of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the field is the world; and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom; and the evil seeds are the sons of the Evil One;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he who put them in the earth is Satan; and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world; and those who get it in are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As then the evil plants are got together and burned with fire, so will it be in the end of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man will send out his angels, and they will take out of his kingdom everything which is a cause of error, and all those who do wrong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And will put them into the fire; there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then will the upright be shining as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him give ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The kingdom of heaven is like a secret store of wealth in a field, which a man came across and put back again; and in his joy he goes and gives all he has, to get that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a trader searching for beautiful jewels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And having come across one jewel of great price, he went and gave all he had in exchange for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, which was put into the sea and took in every sort of fish:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When it was full, they took it up on the sands; and seated there they put the good into vessels, but the bad they put away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So will it be in the end of the world: the angels will come and take out the bad from the good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And will put them into the fire: there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Are all these things now clear to you? They say to him, Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said to them, For this reason every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house, who gives out from his store things new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when Jesus had come to the end of these stories he went away from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And coming into his country, he gave them teaching in their Synagogue, so that they were greatly surprised and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the woodworker's son? is not his mother named Mary? and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And his sisters, are they not all with us? from where, then, has he all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were bitter against him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And the works of power which he did there were small in number because they had no faith.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
