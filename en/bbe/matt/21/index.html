And Jesus said to them, Yes: have you not seen in the Writings, From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he went away from them, and went out of the town to Bethany, and was there for the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning when he was coming back to the town, he had a desire for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And seeing a fig-tree by the wayside, he came to it, and saw nothing on it but leaves only; and he said to it, Let there be no fruit from you from this time forward for ever. And straight away the fig-tree became dry and dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the disciples saw it they were surprised, saying, How did the fig-tree become dry in so short a time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus in answer said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, without doubting, not only may you do what has been done to the fig-tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and put into the sea, it will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all things, whatever you make request for in prayer, having faith, you will get.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he had come into the Temple, the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these things? and who gave you this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus said to them in answer, I will put one question to you, and if you give me the answer, I will say by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of John, where did it come from? from heaven or from men? And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you not have faith in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we say, From men; we are in fear of the people, because all take John to be a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they made answer and said, We have no idea. Then he said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But how does it seem to you? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go and do work today in the vine-garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said in answer, I will not: but later, changing his decision, he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he came to the second and said the same. And he made answer and said, I go, sir: and went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did his father's pleasure? They say, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, that tax-farmers and loose women are going into the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you had no faith in him, but the tax-farmers and the loose women had faith in him: and you, when you saw it, did not even have regret for your sins, so as to have faith in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Give ear to another story. A master of a house made a vine garden, and put a wall round it, and made a place for crushing out the wine, and made a tower, and let it out to field-workers, and went into another country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the time for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the workmen, to get the fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the workmen made an attack on his servants, giving blows to one, putting another to death, and stoning another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, he sent other servants more in number than the first: and they did the same to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But after that he sent his son to them, saying, They will have respect for my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the workmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property; come, let us put him to death and take his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they took him and, driving him out of the vine-garden, put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When, then, the lord of the vine-garden comes, what will he do to those workmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say to him, He will put those cruel men to a cruel death, and will let out the vine-garden to other workmen, who will give him the fruit when it is ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus says to them, Did you never see in the Writings, The stone which the builders put on one side, the same has been made the chief stone of the building: this was the Lord's doing, and it is a wonder in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For this reason I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Any man falling on this stone will be broken, but he on whom it comes down will be crushed to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when his stories came to the ears of the chief priests and the Pharisees, they saw that he was talking of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And though they had a desire to take him, they were in fear of the people, because in their eyes he was a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
