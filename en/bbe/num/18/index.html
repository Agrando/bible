This is an agreement made with salt before the Lord, to you and to your seed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord said to Aaron, You will have no heritage in their land, or any part among them; I am your part and your heritage among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And to the children of Levi I have given as their heritage all the tenths offered in Israel, as payment for the work they do, the work of the Tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In future the children of Israel are not to come near the Tent of meeting, so that death may not come to them because of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the Levites are to do the work of the Tent of meeting, and be responsible for errors in connection with it: this is a law for ever through all your generations; and among the children of Israel they will have no heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the tenths which the children of Israel give as a lifted offering to the Lord I have given to the Levites as their heritage. and so I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they will have no heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Say to the Levites, When you take from the children of Israel the tenth which I have given to you from them as your heritage, a tenth part of that tenth is to be offered as an offering lifted up before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this lifted offering is to be put to your credit as if it was grain from the grain-floor and wine from the vines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So you are to make an offering lifted up to the Lord from all the tenths which you get from the children of Israel, giving out of it the Lord's lifted offering to Aaron the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From everything given to you, let the best of it, the holy part of it, be offered as a lifted offering to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Say to them, then, When the best of it is lifted up on high, it is to be put to the account of the Levites as the increase of the grain-floor and of the place where the grapes are crushed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is to be your food, for you and your families in every place: it is your reward for your work in the Tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And no sin will be yours on account of it, when the best of it has been lifted up on high; you are not to make a wrong use of the holy things of the children of Israel, so that death may not overtake you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
