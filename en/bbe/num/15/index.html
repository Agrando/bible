as you are, so is he to be before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the rule are to be the same for you and for those from other lands living with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Say to the children of Israel, When you come into the land where I am guiding you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, when you take for your food the produce of the land, you are to give an offering lifted up before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Of the first of your rough meal you are to give a cake for a lifted offering, lifting it up before the Lord as the offering of the grain-floor is lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From generation to generation you are to give to the Lord a lifted offering from the first of your rough meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if in error you go against any of these laws which the Lord has given to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All the laws which the Lord has given you by the hand of Moses, from the day when the Lord gave them, and ever after from generation to generation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then, if the wrong is done in error, without the knowledge of the meeting of the people, let all the meeting give a young ox as a burned offering, a sweet smell to the Lord, with its meal offering and its drink offering, as is ordered in the law, together with a he-goat for a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the priest will make the people free from sin, and they will have forgiveness; for it was an error, and they have given their offering made by fire to the Lord, and their sin-offering before the Lord, on account of their error:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And all the meeting of the children of Israel, as well as those from other lands living among them, will have forgiveness; for it was an error on the part of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if one person does wrong, without being conscious of it, then let him give a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the priest will take away the sin of the person who has done wrong, if the wrong was done unconsciously, and he will have forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The law in connection with wrong done unconsciously is to be the same for him who is an Israelite by birth and for the man from another country who is living among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the person who does wrong in the pride of his heart, if he is one of you or of another nation by birth, is acting without respect for the Lord, and will be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he had no respect for the word of the Lord, and did not keep his law, that man will be cut off without mercy and his sin will be on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now while the children of Israel were in the waste land, they saw a man who was getting sticks on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those who saw him getting sticks took him before Moses and Aaron and all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they had him shut up, because they had no directions about what was to be done with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then the Lord said to Moses, Certainly the man is to be put to death: let him be stoned by all the people outside the tent-circle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So all the people took him outside the tent-circle and he was stoned to death there, as the Lord gave orders to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Say to the children of Israel that through all their generations they are to put on the edges of their robes an ornament of twisted threads, and in every ornament a blue cord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So that, looking on these ornaments, you may keep in mind the orders of the Lord and do them; and not be guided by the desires of your hearts and eyes, through which you have been untrue to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And that you may keep in mind all my orders and do them and be holy to your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt, so that I might be your God: I am the Lord your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
