And the Lord took note of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the man Moses was more gentle than any other man on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the Tent of meeting. And the three of them went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, taking his place at the door of the Tent, and made Aaron and Miriam come before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, Now give ear to my words: if there is a prophet among you I will give him knowledge of myself in a vision and will let my words come to him in a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My servant Moses is not so; he is true to me in all my house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>With him I will have talk mouth to mouth, openly and not in dark sayings; and with his eyes he will see the form of the Lord: why then had you no fear of saying evil against my servant Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And burning with wrath against them, the Lord went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the cloud was moved from over the Tent; and straight away Miriam became a leper, as white as snow: and Aaron, looking at Miriam, saw that she was a leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Aaron said to Moses, O my lord, let not our sin be on our heads, for we have done foolishly and are sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half wasted when he comes out from the body of his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses, crying to the Lord, said, Let my prayer come before you, O God, and make her well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord said to Moses, If her father had put a mark of shame on her, would she not be shamed for seven days? Let her be shut up outside the tent-circle for seven days, and after that she may come in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Miriam was shut up outside the tent-circle for seven days: and the people did not go forward on their journey till Miriam had come in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After that, the people went on from Hazeroth and put up their tents in the waste land of Paran.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
