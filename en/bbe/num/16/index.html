We will not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Moses was very angry, and said to the Lord, Give no attention to their offering: not one of their asses have I taken, or done wrong to any of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses said to Korah, You and all your band are to come before the Lord tomorrow, you and they and Aaron:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And let every man take a vessel for burning perfumes, and put sweet spices in them; let every man take his vessel before the Lord, two hundred and fifty vessels; you and Aaron and everyone with his vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So every man took his vessel and they put fire in them, with spices, and came to the door of the Tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Korah made all the people come together against them to the door of the Tent of meeting: and the glory of the Lord was seen by all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Come out from among this people, so that I may send sudden destruction on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then falling down on their faces they said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, because of one man's sin will your wrath be moved against all the people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Say to the people, Come away from the tent of Korah Dathan, and Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the responsible men of Israel went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to the people, Come away now from the tents of these evil men, without touching anything of theirs, or you may be taken in the punishment of their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So on every side they went away from the tent of Korah Dathan, and Abiram: and Dathan and Abiram came out to the door of their tents, with their wives and their sons and their little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses said, Now you will see that the Lord has sent me to do all these works, and I have not done them of myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If these men have the common death of men, or if the natural fate of all men overtakes them, then the Lord has not sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if the Lord does something new, opening the earth to take them in, with everything which is theirs, and they go down living into the underworld, then it will be clear to you that the Lord has not been honoured by these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And while these words were on his lips, the earth under them was parted in two;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the earth, opening her mouth, took them in, with their families, and all the men who were joined to Korah, and their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they and all theirs went down living into the underworld, and the earth was shut over them, and they were cut off from among the meeting of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And all Israel round about them went in flight at their cry, For fear, said they, that we go down into the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then fire came out from the Lord, burning up the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Say to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he is to take out of the flames the vessels with the perfumes in them, turning the fire out of them, for they are holy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And let the vessels of those men, who with their lives have made payment for their sin, be hammered out into plates as a cover for the altar; for they have been offered before the Lord and are holy; so that they may be a sign to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So Eleazar the priest took the brass vessels which had been offered by those who were burned up, and they were hammered out to make a cover for the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>To be a sign, kept in memory for ever by the children of Israel, that no man who is not of the seed of Aaron has the right of burning spices before the Lord, so that he may not be like Korah and his band: as the Lord said to him by the mouth of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But on the day after, all the children of Israel made an outcry against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have put to death the Lord's people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now when the people had come together against Moses and Aaron, looking in the direction of the Tent of meeting, they saw the cloud covering it, and the glory of the Lord came before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Come out from among this people, so that I may send sudden destruction on them. And they went down on their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take your vessel and put in it fire from the altar, and sweet spices, and take it quickly into the meeting of the people, and make them free from sin: for wrath has gone out from the Lord, and the disease is starting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And at the words of Moses, Aaron took his vessel, and went running among the people; and even then the disease had made a start among them; and he put spices in his vessel to take away the sin of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he took his place between the dead and the living: and the disease was stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now fourteen thousand, seven hundred deaths were caused by that disease, in addition to those who came to their end because of what Korah had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Aaron went back to Moses to the door of the Tent of meeting: and the disease came to a stop.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
