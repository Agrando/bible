this is to be a law for you for ever, from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if you go to war in your land against any who do you wrong, then let the loud note of the horn be sounded; and the Lord your God will keep you in mind and give you salvation from those who are against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on days of joy and on your regular feasts and on the first day of every month, let the horns be sounded over your burned offerings and your peace-offerings; and they will put the Lord in mind of you: I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now in the second year, on the twentieth day of the second month, the cloud was taken up from over the Tent of witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the children of Israel went on their journey out of the waste land of Sinai; and the cloud came to rest in the waste land of Paran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They went forward for the first time on their journey as the Lord had given orders by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>First the flag of the children of Judah went forward with their armies: and at the head of his army was Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And at the head of the army of the children of Issachar was Nethanel, the son of Zuar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And at the head of the army of the children of Zebulun was Eliab, the son of Helon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the House was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were responsible for moving the House, went forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the flag of the children of Reuben went forward with their armies: and at the head of his army was Elizur, the son of Shedeur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And at the head of the army of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At the head of the army of the children of Gad was Eliasaph, the son of Reuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the Kohathites went forward with the holy place; the others put up the House ready for their coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the flag of the children of Ephraim went forward with their armies: and at the head of his army was Elishama, the son of Ammihud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the head of the army of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>At the head of the army of the children of Benjamin was Abidan, the son of Gideoni.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the flag of the children of Dan, whose tents were moved last of all, went forward with their armies: and at the head of his army was Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At the head of the army of the children of Asher was Pagiel, the son of Ochran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And at the head of the army of the children of Naphtali was Ahira, the son of Enan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This was the order in which the children of Israel were journeying by armies; so they went forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of his father-in-law Reuel the Midianite, We are journeying to that place of which the Lord has said, I will give it to you: so come with us, and it will be for your profit: for the Lord has good things in store for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he said, I will not go with you, I will go back to the land of my birth and to my relations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Do not go from us; for you will be eyes for us, guiding us to the right places in the waste land to put up our tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And if you come with us, we will give you a part in whatever good the Lord does for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they went forward three days' journey from the mountain of the Lord; and the ark of the Lord's agreement went three days' journey before them, looking for a resting-place for them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And by day the cloud of the Lord went over them, when they went forward from the place where they had put up their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the ark went forward Moses said, Come up, O Lord, and let the armies of those who are against you be broken, and let your haters go in flight before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when it came to rest, he said, Take rest, O Lord, and give a blessing to the families of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
