Give us a heritage among our father's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Moses put their cause before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What the daughters of Zelophehad say is right: certainly you are to give them a heritage among their father's brothers: and let the property which would have been their father's go to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And say to the children of Israel, If a man has no son at the time of his death, let his heritage go to his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he has no daughter, then give his heritage to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if he has no brothers, then give his heritage to his father's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if his father has no brothers, then give it to his nearest relation in the family, as his heritage: this is to be a decision made by law for the children of Israel, as the Lord gave orders to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Lord said to Moses, Go up into this mountain of Abarim so that you may see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when you have seen it, you will be put to rest with your people, as your brother Aaron was:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because in the waste land of Zin, when the people were angry, you and he went against my word and did not keep my name holy before their eyes, at the waters. (These are the waters of Meribah in Kadesh in the waste land of Zin.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Moses said to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, put a man at the head of this people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To go out and come in before them and be their guide; so that the people of the Lord may not be like sheep without a keeper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Lord said to Moses, Take Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and put your hand on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And take him before Eleazar the priest and all the meeting of the people, and give him his orders before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And put your honour on him, so that all the children of Israel may be under his authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He will take his place before Eleazar the priest, so that he may get directions from the Lord for him, with the Urim: at his word they will go out, and at his word they will come in, he and all the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Moses did as the Lord said: he took Joshua and put him before Eleazar the priest and the meeting of the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he put his hands on him and gave him his orders, as the Lord had said by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
