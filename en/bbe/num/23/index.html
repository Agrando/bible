And he went to an open place on a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God came to Balaam, and Balaam said to him, I have made ready seven altars, offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord put words in Balaam's mouth, and said, Go back to Balak, and this is what you are to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he went back to him where he was waiting by his burned offering with all the chiefs of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in the words which the Lord had given him he said, From Aram Balak has sent for me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East: come, put curses on Jacob for me and be angry with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How may I put curses on him who is not cursed by God? how may I be angry with him with whom the Lord is not angry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>From the top of the rocks I see him, looking down on him from the hills: it is a people made separate, not to be numbered among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is able to take the measure of the dust of Jacob or the number of the thousands of Israel? May my death be the death of the upright and my last end like his!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I sent for you so that my haters might be cursed, and see, you have given them a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in answer he said, Am I not ordered to say only what the Lord puts into my mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Balak said to him, Come with me now into another place from which you will not be able to see them all, but only the outskirts of them; and you will send curses on them from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he took him into the country of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and there they made seven altars, offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said to Balak, Take your place here by your burned offering, while I go over there to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Lord came to Balaam, and put words in his mouth, and said, Go back to Balak, and this is what you are to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he came to him where he was waiting by his burned offering with the chiefs of Moab by his side. And Balak said to him, What has the Lord said?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in the words which the Lord had given him he said, Up! Balak, and give ear; give attention to me, O son of Zippor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God is not a man, to say what is false; or the son of man, that his purpose may be changed: what he has said, will he not do? and will he not give effect to the words of his mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>See, I have had orders to give blessing: and he has given a blessing which I have no power to take away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He has seen no evil in Jacob or wrongdoing in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the glad cry of a king is among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is God who has taken them out of Egypt; his horns are like those of the mountain ox.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>No evil power has effect against Jacob, no secret arts against Israel; at the right time it will be said of Jacob and of Israel, See what God has done!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>See, Israel comes up like a she-lion, lifting himself up like a lion: he will take no rest till he has made a meal of those he has overcome, drinking the blood of those he has put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Balak said to Balaam, If you will not put a curse on them, at all events do not give them a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Balaam in answer said to Balak, Did I not say to you, I may only do what the Lord says?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place; it may be that God will let you put a curse on them from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, looking down over the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Make me seven altars here and get seven oxen and seven male sheep ready for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Balak did as Balaam said, offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
