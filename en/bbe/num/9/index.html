and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And these men said to him, We have been made unclean by the dead body of a man; why may we not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time among the children of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said to them, Do nothing till the Lord gives me directions about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say to the children of Israel, If any one of you or of your families is unclean because of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, still he is to keep the Passover to the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the second month, on the fourteenth day, in the evening, they are to keep it, taking it with unleavened bread and bitter-tasting plants;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Nothing of it is to be kept till the morning, and no bone of it is to be broken: they are to keep it by the rules of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the man who, not being unclean or on a journey, does not keep the Passover, will be cut off from his people: because he did not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time, his sin will be on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man from another country is among you and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let him do as is ordered in the law of the Passover: there is to be the same rule for the man from another nation and for him who had his birth in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And on the day when the House was put up, the cloud came down on it, on the Tent of witness; and in the evening there was a light like fire over the House till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And so it was at all times: it was covered by the cloud, and by a light as of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the House, then the children of Israel went journeying on; and in the place where the cloud came to rest, there the children of Israel put up their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the order of the Lord the children of Israel went forward, and at the order of the Lord they put up their tents: as long as the cloud was resting on the House, they did not go away from that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When the cloud was resting on the House for a long time the children of Israel, waiting for the order of the Lord, did not go on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Sometimes the cloud was resting on the House for two or three days; then, by the order of the Lord, they kept their tents in that place, and when the Lord gave the order they went on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And sometimes the cloud was there only from evening to morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning they went on their journey again: or if it was resting there by day and by night, whenever the cloud was taken up they went forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Or if the cloud came to rest on the House for two days or a month or a year without moving, the children of Israel went on waiting there and did not go on; but whenever it was taken up they went forward on their journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the word of the Lord they put up their tents, and at the word of the Lord they went forward on their journey: they kept the orders of the Lord as he gave them by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
