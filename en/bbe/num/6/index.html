till the days while he is separate are ended he is holy and his hair may not be cut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All the time he is separate he may not come near any dead body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He may not make himself unclean for his father or his mother, his sister or his brother, if death comes to them; because he is under an oath to keep himself separate for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the time he is separate he is holy to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If death comes suddenly to a man at his side, so that he becomes unclean, let his hair be cut off on the day when he is made clean, on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the eighth day let him take to the priest, at the door of the Tent of meeting, two doves or two young pigeons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priest will give one for a sin-offering and the other for a burned offering to take away the sin which came on him on account of the dead, and he will make his head holy that same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will give to the Lord his days of being separate, offering a he-lamb of the first year as an offering for error: but the earlier days will be a loss, because he became unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this is the law for him who is separate, when the necessary days are ended: he is to come to the door of the Tent of meeting,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And make his offering to the Lord; one he-lamb of the first year, without a mark, for a burned offering, and one female lamb of the first year, without a mark, for a sin-offering, and one male sheep, without a mark, for peace-offerings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of the best meal mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes covered with oil, with their meal offering and drink offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest will take them before the Lord, and make his sin-offering and his burned offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Giving the sheep of the peace-offerings, with the basket of unleavened bread;

this is holy for the priest, together with the waved breast and the leg which is lifted up; after that, the man may take wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the law for him who takes an oath to keep himself separate, and for his offering to the Lord on that account, in addition to what he may be able to get; this is the law of his oath, which he will have to keep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Say to Aaron and his sons, These are the words of blessing which are to be used by you in blessing the children of Israel; say to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>May the Lord send his blessing on you and keep you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>May the light of the Lord's face be shining on you in grace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>May the Lord's approval be resting on you and may he give you peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they will put my name on the children of Israel, and I will give them my blessing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
