hundred of the tribe of Benjamin were numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The generations of the sons of Dan were numbered by their families and their fathers' houses, every male

war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But the Levites, of the tribe of their fathers, were not numbered among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For the Lord said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Only the tribe of Levi is not to be numbered among the children of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But to them you are to give the care of the Tent of meeting with its vessels and everything in it: they are to take up the Tent, and be responsible for everything to do with it, and put up their tents round it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And when the Tent of meeting goes forward, the Levites are to take it down; and when it is to be put up, they are to do it: any strange person who comes near it is to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The children of Israel are to put up their tents, every man in his tent-circle round his flag.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But the tents of the Levites are to be round the Tent of meeting, so that wrath may not come on the children of Israel: the Tent of meeting is to be in the care of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So the children of Israel did as the Lord had given orders to Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
