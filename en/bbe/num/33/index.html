to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Say to the children of Israel, When you go over Jordan into the land of Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>See that all the people of the land are forced out from before you, and put to destruction all their pictured stones, and all their metal images, and all their high places:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And take the land for yourselves, for your resting-place: for to you I have given the land as your heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And you will take up your heritage in the land by the decision of the Lord, to every family its part; the greater the family the greater its heritage, and the smaller the family the smaller will be its heritage; wherever the decision of the Lord gives to any man his part, that will be his; distribution will be made to you by your fathers' tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But if you are slow in driving out the people of the land, then those of them who are still there will be like pin-points in your eyes and like thorns in your sides, troubling you in the land where you are living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And it will come about that as it was my purpose to do to them, so I will do to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
