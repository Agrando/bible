Our wives and our little ones will get into strange hands: would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said to one another, Let us make a captain over us, and go back to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Moses and Aaron went down on their faces before the meeting of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, two of those who had been to see the land, giving signs of grief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Said to all the children of Israel, This land which we went through to see is a very good land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the Lord has delight in us, he will take us into this land and give it to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Only, do not go against the Lord or go in fear of the people of the land, for they will be our food; their strength has been taken from them and the Lord is with us: have no fear of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But all the people said they were to be stoned. Then the glory of the Lord was seen in the Tent of meeting, before the eyes of all the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord said to Moses, How long will this people have no respect for me? how long will they be without faith, in the face of all the signs I have done among them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will send disease on them for their destruction, and take away their heritage, and I will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to the Lord, Then it will come to the ears of the Egyptians; for by your power you took this people out from among them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they will give the news to the people of this land: they have had word that you, Lord, are present with this people, letting yourself be seen face to face, and that your cloud is resting over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if you put to death all this people as one man, then the nations who have had word of your glory will say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because the Lord was not able to take this people into the land which he made an oath to give them, he sent destruction on them in the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So now, may my prayer come before you, and let the power of the Lord be great, as you said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord is slow to wrath and great in mercy, overlooking wrongdoing and evil, and will not let wrongdoers go free; sending punishment on children for the sins of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>May the sin of this people have forgiveness, in the measure of your great mercy, as you have had mercy on them from Egypt up till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord said, I have had mercy, as you say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But truly, as I am living, and as all the earth will be full of the glory of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because all these men, having seen my glory and the signs which I have done in Egypt and in the waste land, still have put me to the test ten times, and have not given ear to my voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They will not see the land about which I made an oath to their fathers; not one of these by whom I have not been honoured will see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But my servant Caleb, because he had a different spirit in him, and has been true to me with all his heart, him I will take into that land into which he went, and his seed will have it for their heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are in the valley; tomorrow, turning round, go into the waste land by the way to the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How long am I to put up with this evil people and their outcries against me? The words which they say against me have come to my ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say to them, By my life, says the Lord, as certainly as your words have come to my ears, so certainly will I do this to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Your dead bodies will be stretched out in this waste land; and of all your number, all those of twenty years old and over who have been crying out against me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Not one will come into the land which I gave my word you would have for your resting-place, but only Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And your little ones, whom you said would come into strange hands, I will take in, and they will see the land which you would not have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But as for you, your dead bodies will be stretched in this waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And your children will be wanderers in the waste land for forty years, undergoing punishment for your false ways, till your bodies become dust in the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as you went through the land viewing it for forty days, so for forty years, a year for every day, you will undergo punishment for your wrongdoing, and you will see that I am against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I the Lord have said it, and this I will certainly do to all this evil people who have come together against me: in this waste land destruction will come on them, and death will be their fate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the men whom Moses sent to see the land, and who, by the bad account they gave of the land, were the cause of the outcry the people made against Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Those same men who said evil of the land, came to their death by disease before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, of those who went to see the land, were not touched by disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when Moses put these words before the children of Israel, the people were full of grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And early in the morning they got up and went to the top of the mountain, saying, We are here and we will go up to the place which the Lord said he would give us: for we have done wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Moses said, Why are you now acting against the Lord's order, seeing that no good will come of it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Go not up, for the Lord is not with you, and you will be overcome by those who are fighting against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you will be put to death by their swords: because you have gone back from the way of the Lord, the Lord will not be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But they gave no attention to his words and went to the top of the mountain, though Moses and the ark of the Lord's agreement did not go out of the tent-circle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who were living in the hill-country, and overcame them completely, driving them back as far as Hormah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
