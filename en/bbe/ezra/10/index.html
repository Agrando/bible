So they took an oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Ezra got up from before the house of God and went into the room of Jehohanan, the son of Eliashib; but when he came there, he took no food or drink, for he was sorrowing for the sin of those who had come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they made a public statement through all Judah and Jerusalem, to all those who had come back, that they were to come together to Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And that if anyone did not come before three days were past, as ordered by the rulers and the responsible men, all his goods would be put under the curse, and he himself would be cut off from the meeting of the people who had come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin came together to Jerusalem before three days were past; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people were seated in the wide square in front of the house of God, shaking with fear because of this business and because of the great rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Ezra the priest got to his feet and said to them, You have done wrong and taken strange women for your wives, so increasing the sin of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So now, give praise to the Lord, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and make yourselves separate from the peoples of the land and from the strange women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the people, answering, said with a loud voice, As you have said, so it is right for us to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the number of people is great, and it is a time of much rain; it is not possible for us to go on waiting outside, and this is not a thing which may be done in one day or even two: for our sin in this business is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So now let our rulers be representatives for all the people, and let all those in our towns who are married to strange women come at fixed times, and with them the responsible men and the judges of every town, till the burning wrath of our God is turned away from us, and this has been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, the son of Tikvah, were against this, Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So those who had come back did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of families, by their fathers' families, all of them by their names, were marked out; and on the first day of the tenth month they took their places to go into the question with care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they got to the end of all the men who were married to strange women by the first day of the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And among the sons of the priests who were married to strange women were these: of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak and his brothers, Maaseiah and Eliezer and Jarib and Gedaliah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they gave their word that they would put away their wives; and for their sin, they gave an offering of a male sheep of the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And of the sons of Immer, Hanani and Zebadiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And of the sons of Harim, Maaseiah and Elijah and Shemaiah and Jehiel and Uzziah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And of the sons of Pashhur, Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of the Levites, Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (that is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And of the music-makers, Eliashib; and of the door-keepers, Shallum and Telem and Uri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And of Israel, the sons of Parosh, Ramiah and Izziah and Malchijah and Mijamin and Eleazar and Malchijah and Benaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And of the sons of Elam, Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel and Abdi and Jeremoth and Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And of the sons of Zattu, Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth and Zabad and Aziza.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And of the sons of Bebai, Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And of the sons of Bani, Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub and Sheal, Jeremoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And of the sons of Pahath-moab, Adna and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel and Binnui and Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And of the sons of Harim, Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Of the sons of Hashum, Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Of the sons of Bani, Maadai, Amram, and Uel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Bani and Binnui, Shimei;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Shelemiah and Nathan and Adaiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Azarel and Shelemiah, Shemariah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Shallum, Amariah, Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Of the sons of Nebo, Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, and Joel, Benaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>All these had taken strange wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had offspring.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
