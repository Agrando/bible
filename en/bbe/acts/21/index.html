They will certainly get news that you have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do this, then, which we say to you: We have four men who have taken an oath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Go with these, and make yourself clean with them, and make the necessary payments for them, so that they may be free from their oath: and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true, but that you put yourself under rule, and keep the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as to the Gentiles who have the faith, we sent a letter, giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods, and from blood, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from the evil desires of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and on the day after, making himself clean with them, he went into the Temple, giving out the statement that the days necessary for making them clean were complete, till the offering was made for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the Temple, got the people together and put their hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Crying out, Men of Israel, come to our help: this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place: and in addition, he has taken Greeks into the Temple, and made this holy place unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus, and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the town was moved, and the people came running together and put their hands on Paul, pulling him out of the Temple: and then the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And while they were attempting to put him to death, news came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was out of control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them: and the Jews, seeing them, gave no more blows to Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the chief captain came near and took him, and gave orders for him to be put in chains, questioning them as to who he was and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some said one thing and some another, among the people: and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise, he gave orders for Paul to be taken into the army building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he came on to the steps, he was lifted up by the armed men, because of the force of the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For a great mass of people came after them, crying out, Away with him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when Paul was about to be taken into the building, he said to the chief captain, May I say something to you? And he said, Have you a knowledge of Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Are you by chance the Egyptian who, before this, got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the Assassins out into the waste land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, which is not an unimportant town: I make a request to you to let me say a word to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he let him do so, Paul, from the steps, made a sign with his hand to the people, and when they were all quiet, he said to them in the Hebrew language,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
