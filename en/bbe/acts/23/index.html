and we, before ever he gets to you, will be waiting to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Paul's sister's son had word of their design, and he came into the army building and gave news of it to Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Paul sent for a captain and said, Take this young man to your chief, for he has news for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he took him to the chief captain and said, Paul, the prisoner, made a request to me to take this young man to you, for he has something to say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief took him by the hand and, going on one side, said to him privately, What is it you have to say to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, The Jews are in agreement together to make a request to you for Paul to be taken, on the day after this, into the Sanhedrin, to be questioned in greater detail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But do not give way to them, for more than forty of them are waiting for him, having taken an oath not to take food or drink till they have put him to death: and now they are ready, waiting for your order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the chief captain let the young man go, saying to him, Do not say to anyone that you have given me word of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he sent for two captains and said, Make ready two hundred men, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, to go to Caesarea, at the third hour of the night:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And get beasts so that they may put Paul on them, and take him safely to Felix, the ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he sent a letter in these words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Claudius Lysias, to the most noble ruler, Felix, peace be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be put to death by them, when I came on them with the army and took him out of danger, having knowledge that he was a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, desiring to get at the reason for their attack on him, I took him down to their Sanhedrin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law, and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man, I sent him straight away to you, giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the armed men, as they were ordered, took Paul and came by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But on the day after, they sent the horsemen on with him, and went back to their place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they, when they came to Caesarea, gave the letter to the ruler, and took Paul before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And after reading it, he said, What part of the country do you come from? And, hearing that he was from Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I will give hearing to your cause, he said, when those who are against you have come. And he gave orders for him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
