Judas, named Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they sent a letter by them, saying, The Apostles and the older brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, may joy be with you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words, putting your souls in doubt; to whom we gave no such order;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It seemed good to us, having come to an agreement together, to send these men to you, with our well loved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And so we have sent Judas and Silas, who will say the same things to you themselves, by word of mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to put on you nothing more than these necessary things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To keep from things offered to false gods, and from blood, and from things put to death in ways which are against the law, and from the evil desires of the body; if you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. May you be happy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they, being sent away, came down to Antioch, and having got the people together, they gave them the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after reading it, they were glad of its comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, gave teaching to the brothers and made them strong in the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they had been there for some time, they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Paul and Barnabas kept on in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of God, with a number of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back and see the brothers in every town where we have given the word of God, and see how they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Barnabas had a desire to take with them John, named Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul was of the opinion that it was not right to take with them one who had gone away from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And there was a sharp argument between them, so that they were parted from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and went by ship to Cyprus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Paul took Silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, making the churches stronger in the faith.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
