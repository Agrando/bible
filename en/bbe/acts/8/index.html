Now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in Jerusalem; and all but the Apostles went away into all parts of Judaea and Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And God-fearing men put Stephen's body in its last resting-place, making great weeping over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul was burning with hate against the church, going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Philip went down to Samaria and was teaching them about Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all the people gave attention to the words which Philip said, when they saw the signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For unclean spirits came out from those who had them, crying with a loud voice; and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was much joy in that town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom they all gave attention, from the smallest to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is named Great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they gave attention to him, because for a long time his wonder-working powers had kept them under his control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, a number of men and women had baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Simon himself had faith and, having had baptism, he went with Philip and, seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did, he was full of surprise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts, they sent to them Peter and John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who, when they came there, made prayer for them, that the Holy Spirit might be given to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For up to that time he had not come on any of them; only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they put their hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles' hands, he made them an offering of money, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Give me this power, so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said, May your money come to destruction with you, because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let your heart be changed, and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Simon, answering, said, Make prayer for me to the Lord, so that these things which you have said may not come on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So they, having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord, went back to Jerusalem, giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Get up, and go to the south, to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia, a servant of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and controller of all her property, who had come up to Jerusalem for worship;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He was going back, seated in his carriage, and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and get on his carriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip, running up to him, saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet, and said to him, Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How is that possible when I have no guide? And he made Philip get up by his side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Being of low degree, his cause was not given a hearing: who has knowledge of his family? for his life is cut off from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the Ethiopian said to Philip, About whom are these words said by the prophet? about himself, or some other?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So Philip, starting from this writing, gave him the good news about Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And while they were going on their way, they came to some water, and the Ethiopian said, See, here is water; why may I not have baptism?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped, and the two of them went down into the water, and Philip gave him baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; and the Ethiopian saw him no more, for he went on his way full of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip came to Azotus, and went through all the towns, preaching the good news, till he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
