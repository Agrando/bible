And these six brothers came with me; and we went into that man's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house, saying, Send to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who will say words to you through which you and all your family may get salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, while I was talking to them, the Holy Spirit came on them, as on us at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the words of the Lord came into my mind, how he said, The baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then God gave them, when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the same as he gave to us, who was I to go against God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And hearing these things they said nothing more, but gave glory to God, saying, Then to the Gentiles as to us has God given a change of heart, so that they may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus, preaching to the Jews only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, when they came to Antioch, gave the good news about the Lord Jesus to the Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the power of the Lord was with them, and a great number had faith and were turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And news of them came to the ears of the church at Jerusalem: and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, when he came and saw the grace of God, was glad; and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the Lord with all the strength of their hearts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and a great number were joined to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he went on to Tarsus, looking for Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he had come across him, he took him to Antioch. And they were with the church there for a year, teaching the people; and the disciples were first given the name of Christians in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now in those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of them, named Agabus, said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth: which came about in the time of Claudius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the disciples, everyone as he was able, made a decision to send help to the brothers living in Judaea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Which they did, sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
