And some said, What is this talker of foolish words saying? And others, He seems to be a preacher of strange gods: because he was preaching of Jesus and his coming back from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took him to Mars' Hill, saying, Will you make clear to us what is this new teaching of yours?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you seem to us to say strange things, and we have a desire to get the sense of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(Now all the Athenians and the men from other lands who come there were giving all their time to talking or hearing of anything new.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Paul got to his feet on Mars' Hill and said, O men of Athens, I see that you are overmuch given to fear of the gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For when I came by, I was looking at the things to which you give worship, and I saw an altar with this writing on it, TO THE GOD OF WHOM THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE. Now, what you, without knowledge, give worship to, I make clear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the earth and everything in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, is not housed in buildings made with hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he is not dependent on the work of men's hands, as if he had need of anything, for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he has made of one blood all the nations of men living on all the face of the earth, ordering their times and the limits of their lands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So that they might make search for God, in order, if possible, to get knowledge of him and make discovery of him, though he is not far from every one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in him we have life and motion and existence; as certain of your verse writers have said, For we are his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If then we are the offspring of God, it is not right for us to have the idea that God is like gold or silver or stone, formed by the art or design of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by God; but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work; of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now on hearing about the coming back from death, some of them made sport of it, but others said, Let us go more fully into this another time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And so Paul went away from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some men gave him their support: among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
