and we were there for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And on the first day of the week, when we had come together for the holy meal, Paul gave them a talk, for it was his purpose to go away on the day after; and he went on talking till after the middle of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were a number of lights in the room where we had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a certain young man named Eutychus, who was seated in the window, went into a deep sleep; and while Paul went on talking, being overcome by sleep, he had a fall from the third floor, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Paul went down and, falling on him, took him in his arms and said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when he had gone up, and had taken the broken bread, he went on talking to them for a long time, even till dawn, and then he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they took the boy in, living, and were greatly comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we, going before him by ship, went to Assos with the purpose of taking Paul in there: for so he had given orders, because he himself was coming by land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he came up with us at Assos, we took him in the ship and went on to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And going from there by sea, we came on the day after opposite Chios, and touching at Samos on the day after that, we came on the third day to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul's purpose was to go past Ephesus, so that he might not be kept in Asia; for he was going quickly, in order, if possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the rulers of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they had come, he said to them, You yourselves have seen what my life has been like all the time from the day when I first came into Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Doing the Lord's work without pride, through all the sorrow and troubles which came on me because of the evil designs of the Jews:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And how I kept back nothing which might be of profit to you, teaching you publicly and privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Preaching to Jews and to Greeks the need for a turning of the heart to God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, as you see, I am going to Jerusalem, a prisoner in spirit, having no knowledge of what will come to me there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only that the Holy Spirit makes clear to me in every town that prison and pains are waiting for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I put no value on my life, if only at the end of it I may see the work complete which was given to me by the Lord Jesus, to be a witness of the good news of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now I am conscious that you, among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom, will not see my face again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so I say to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I have not kept back from you anything of the purpose of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Give attention to yourselves, and to all the flock which the Holy Spirit has given into your care, to give food to the church of God, for which he gave his blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I am conscious that after I am gone, evil wolves will come in among you, doing damage to the flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And from among yourselves will come men who will give wrong teaching, turning away the disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So keep watch, having in mind that for three years without resting I was teaching every one of you, day and night, with weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, I give you into the care of God and the word of his grace, which is able to make you strong and to give you your heritage among all the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have had no desire for any man's silver or gold or clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You yourselves have seen that with these hands I got what was necessary for me and those who were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In all things I was an example to you of how, in your lives, you are to give help to the feeble, and keep in memory the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, There is a greater blessing in giving than in getting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having said these words, he went down on his knees in prayer with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they were all weeping, falling on Paul's neck and kissing him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Being sad most of all because he had said that they would not see his face again. And so they went with him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
