and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on my men-servants and my women-servants I will send my Spirit, and they will be prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And wonders will be seen in heaven, and signs on the earth, blood and fire and smoke:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood, before that great day of the Lord comes in glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Men of Israel, give ear to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man who had the approval of God, as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you, as you yourselves have knowledge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him, when he was given up, by the decision and knowledge of God, you put to death on the cross, by the hands of evil men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David said of him, I saw the Lord before my face at all times, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy, and my flesh will be resting in hope:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have made me see the ways of life; I will be full of joy when I see your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My brothers, I may say to you openly that David came to his death, and was put in the earth, and his resting-place is with us today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But being a prophet, and having in mind the oath which God had given to him, that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He, having knowledge of the future, was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead, that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus God has given back to life, of which we all are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And so, being lifted up to the right hand of God, and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come, he has sent this thing, which now you see and have knowledge of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David has not gone up into heaven, but says, himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Till I put all those who are against you under your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For this reason, let all Israel be certain that this Jesus, whom you put to death on the cross, God has made Lord and Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled, and they said to Peter and the other Apostles, Brothers, what are we to do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter said, Let your hearts be changed, every one of you, and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off, even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with more such words he gave his witness, offering them salvation and saying, Come out from this evil generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism: and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But fear came on every soul: and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all those who were of the faith kept together, and had all things in common;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And exchanging their goods and property for money, they made division of it among them all, as they had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And day by day, going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and, taking broken bread together in their houses, they took their food with joy and with true hearts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Giving praise to God, and having the approval of all the people; and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
