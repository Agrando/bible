And, jumping up, he went walking about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they said in a loud voice, in the language of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the form of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they gave the name of Jupiter to Barnabas, and to Paul that of Mercury, because he was the chief talker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest of the image of Jupiter, which was before the town, took oxen and flowers to the doors of the town, and was about to make an offering with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when this came to the ears of the Apostles, Paul and Barnabas, they went running out among the people, parting their clothing, and crying out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Good people, why are you doing these things? We are men with the same feelings as you, and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who in the past let all nations go in the ways which seemed good to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he was not without witness, because he did good, and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit, making your hearts full of food and joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And even with these words, it was hard for them to keep the people from making an offering to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But some Jews came to that place from Antioch and Iconium, and got control over the people; and after stoning Paul, they had him pulled out of the town, taking him for dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when the disciples came round him, he got up and went into the town: and the day after he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having made a number of disciples through the preaching of the good news in that town, they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Making strong the souls of the disciples, saying to them that they were to keep the faith, and that we have to go through troubles of all sorts to come into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had made selection of some to be rulers in every church, and had given themselves to prayer and kept themselves from food, they put them into the care of the Lord in whom they had faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they went through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, after preaching the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And from there they went by ship to Antioch, where they had been handed over to the grace of God for the work which they had not done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they came there, and had got the church together, they gave them an account of all the things which God had done through them, and how he had made open a door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they were with the disciples there for a long time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
