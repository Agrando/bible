for certainly it is clear to all who are living in Jerusalem that a most important sign has been done by them, and it is not possible to say that it is not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But so that it may not go farther among the people, let us put them in fear of punishment if they say anything in future in this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they sent for them, and gave them orders not to make statements or give teaching in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John in answer said to them, It is for you to say if it is right in the eyes of God to give attention to you more than to God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is not possible for us to keep from saying what we have seen and have knowledge of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had said more sharp words to them, they let them go, not seeing what punishment they might give them, because of the people; for all men were giving praise to God for what had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man on whom this act of power was done was more than forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had been made free, they came back to their friends, and gave an account of all the things which the chief priests and the authorities had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And hearing it, they all, with one mind, made prayer to God and said, O Lord, maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who has said, by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David your servant, Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth were lifted up, the rulers came together, against the Lord, and against his Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, truly, in this town, against your holy servant, Jesus, who was marked out by you as Christ, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, came together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>To do that which had been fixed before by your hand and your purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, take note of their cruel words, and give your servants power to be preachers of your word without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While your hand is stretched out to do works of mercy; so that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when their prayer was ended, the place where they were was violently moved, and they all became full of the Holy Spirit, preaching the word of God without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And all those who were of the faith were one in heart and soul: and not one of them said that any of the things which he had was his property only; but they had all things in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the Apostles gave witness of the coming back of the Lord Jesus from the dead; and grace was on them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And no one among them was in need; for everyone who had land or houses, exchanging them for money, took the price of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And put it at the feet of the Apostles for distribution to everyone as he had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joseph, who was given by the Apostles the name of Barnabas (the sense of which is, Son of comfort), a Levite and a man of Cyprus by birth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Having a field, got money for it and put the money at the feet of the Apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
