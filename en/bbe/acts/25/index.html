Let my cause come before Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, having had a discussion with the Jews, made answer, You have said, Let my cause come before Caesar; to Caesar you will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when some days had gone by, King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea and went to see Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as they were there for some days, Festus gave them Paul's story, saying, There is a certain man here who was put in prison by Felix:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Against whom the chief priests and the rulers of the Jews made a statement when I was at Jerusalem, requesting me to give a decision against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To whom I gave answer that it is not the Roman way to give a man up, till he has been face to face with those who are attacking him, and has had a chance to give an answer to the statements made against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So, when they had come together here, straight away, on the day after, I took my place on the judge's seat and sent for the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But when they got up they said nothing about such crimes as I had in mind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But had certain questions against him in connection with their religion, and about one Jesus, now dead, who, Paul said, was living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as I had not enough knowledge for the discussion of these things, I made the suggestion to him to go to Jerusalem and be judged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Paul made a request that he might be judged by Caesar, I gave orders for him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, I have a desire to give the man a hearing myself. Tomorrow, he said, you may give him a hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So on the day after, when Agrippa and Bernice in great glory had come into the public place of hearing, with the chief of the army and the chief men of the town, at the order of Festus, Paul was sent for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all those who are present here with us, you see this man, about whom all the Jews have made protests to me, at Jerusalem and in this place, saying that it is not right for him to be living any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, in my opinion, there is no cause of death in him, and as he himself has made a request to be judged by Caesar, I have said that I would send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But I have no certain account of him to send to Caesar. So I have sent for him to come before you, and specially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the business has been gone into, I may have something to put in writing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seems to me against reason to send a prisoner without making clear what there is against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
