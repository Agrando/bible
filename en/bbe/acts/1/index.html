This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven, will come again, in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they went back to Jerusalem from the mountain named Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they came in, they went up into the room where they were living; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas, the son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in those days Peter got up among the brothers (there were about one hundred and twenty of them), and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>My brothers, the word of God had to be put into effect, which the Holy Spirit had said before, by the mouth of David, about Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was numbered among us, and had his part in our work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now this man, with the reward of his evil-doing, got for himself a field, and falling head first, came to a sudden and violent end there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in Jerusalem, so that the field was named in their language, Akel-dama, or, The field of blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For in the book of Psalms it says, Let his house be waste, and let no man be living in it: and, Let his position be taken by another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this reason, of the men who have been with us all the time, while the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Starting from the baptism of John till he went up from us, one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they made selection of two, Joseph, named Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they made prayers and said, Lord, having knowledge of the hearts of all men, make clear which of these two has been marked out by you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To take that position as a servant and Apostle, from which Judas by his sin was shut out, so that he might go to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they put it to the decision of chance, and the decision was given for Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
