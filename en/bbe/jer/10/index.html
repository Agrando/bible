Have no fear of it; for it has no power of doing evil and it is not able to do any good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is no one like you, O Lord; you are great and your name is great in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who would not have fear of you, O King of the nations? for it is your right: for among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they are together like beasts and foolish: the teaching of false gods is wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Silver hammered into plates is sent from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the expert workman and of the hands of the gold-worker; blue and purple is their clothing, all the work of expert men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God and an eternal king: when he is angry, the earth is shaking with fear, and the nations give way before his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is what you are to say to them: The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth will be cut off from the earth and from under the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He has made the earth by his power, he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom, and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the sound of his voice there is a massing of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth; he makes the thunder-flames for the rain, and sends out the wind from his store-houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge; every gold-worker is put to shame by the image he has made: for his metal image is deceit, and there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are nothing, a work of error: in the time of their punishment, destruction will overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The heritage of Jacob is not like these; for the maker of all things is his heritage: the Lord of armies is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Get your goods together and go out of the land, O you who are shut up in the walled town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the Lord has said, I will send the people in flight like a stone from the land at this time, troubling them so that they will be conscious of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Sorrow is mine for I am wounded! my wound may not be made well; and I said, Cruel is my disease, I may not be free from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent is pulled down and all my cords are broken: my children have gone from me, and they are not: no longer is there anyone to give help in stretching out my tent and hanging up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the keepers of the sheep have become like beasts, not looking to the Lord for directions: so they have not done wisely and all their flocks have been put to flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>News is going about, see, it is coming, a great shaking is coming from the north country, so that the towns of Judah may be made waste and become the living-place of jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O Lord, I am conscious that a man's way is not in himself: man has no power of guiding his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O Lord, put me right, but with wise purpose; not in your wrath, or you will make me small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let your wrath be let loose on the nations which have no knowledge of you, and on the families who give no worship to your name: for they have made a meal of Jacob, truly they have made a meal of him and put an end to him and made his fields a waste.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
