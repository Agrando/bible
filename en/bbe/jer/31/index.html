is he the child of my delight? for whenever I say things against him, I still keep him in my memory: so my heart is troubled for him; I will certainly have mercy on him, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Put up guiding pillars, make road signs for yourself: give attention to the highway, even the way in which you went: be turned again, O virgin of Israel, be turned to these your towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>How long will you go on turning this way and that, O wandering daughter? for the Lord has made a new thing on the earth, a woman changed into a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, Again will these words be used in the land of Judah and in its towns, when I have let their fate be changed: May the blessing of the Lord be on you, O resting-place of righteousness, O holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Judah and all its towns will be living there together; the farmers and those who go about with flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I have given new strength to the tired soul and to every sorrowing soul in full measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At this, awaking from my sleep, I saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will have Israel and Judah planted with the seed of man and with the seed of beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it will come about that, as I have been watching over them for the purpose of uprooting and smashing down and overturning and sending destruction and causing trouble; so I will be watching over them for the purpose of building up and planting, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In those days they will no longer say, The fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the children's teeth are put on edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But everyone will be put to death for the evil which he himself has done: whoever has taken bitter grapes will himself have his teeth put on edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; which agreement was broken by them, and I gave them up, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my law in their inner parts, writing it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And no longer will they be teaching every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Get knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord: for they will have my forgiveness for their evil-doing, and their sin will go from my memory for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>These are the words of the Lord, who has given the sun for a light by day, ordering the moon and stars for a light by night, who puts the sea in motion, causing the thunder of its waves; the Lord of armies is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If the order of these things before me is ever broken, says the Lord, then will the seed of Israel come to an end as a nation before me for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is what the Lord has said: If the heavens on high may be measured, and the bases of the earth searched out, then I will give up the seed of Israel, because of all they have done, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>See, the days are coming, says the Lord, for the building of the Lord's town, from the tower of Hananel to the doorway of the angle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the measuring-line will go out in front of it as far as the hill Gareb, going round to Goah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the valley of the dead bodies, and all the field of death as far as the stream Kidron, up to the angle of the horses' doorway to the east, will be holy to the Lord; it will not again be uprooted or overturned for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
