But he would not give ear to him: so Irijah made him prisoner and took him to the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the rulers were angry with Jeremiah, and gave him blows and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jeremiah came into the hole of the prison, under the arches, and was there for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then King Zedekiah sent and got him out: and the king, questioning him secretly in his house, said, Is there any word from the Lord? And Jeremiah said, There is. Then he said, You will be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, What has been my sin against you or against your servants or against this people, that you have put me in prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where now are your prophets who said to you, The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now be pleased to give ear, O my lord the king; let my prayer for help come before you, and do not make me go back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, for fear that I may come to my death there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then by the order of Zedekiah the king, Jeremiah was put into the place of the armed watchmen, and they gave him every day a cake of bread from the street of the bread-makers, till all the bread in the town was used up. So Jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
