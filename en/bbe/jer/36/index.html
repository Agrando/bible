So Baruch, the son of Neriah, took the book in his hand and came down to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they said to him, Be seated now, and give us a reading from it. So Baruch did so, reading it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it came about that, after hearing all the words, they said to one another in fear, We will certainly give the king an account of all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And questioning Baruch, they said, Say now, how did you put all these words down in writing from his mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Baruch, answering, said, He said all these things to me by word of mouth, and I put them down with ink in the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the rulers said to Baruch, Go and put yourself in a safe place, you and Jeremiah, and let no man have knowledge of where you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then they went into the open square to the king; but the book they put away in the room of Elishama the scribe; and they gave the king an account of all the words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the king sent Jehudi to get the book, and he took it from the room of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi gave a reading of it in the hearing of the king and all the rulers who were by the king's side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the king was seated in the winter house, and a fire was burning in the fireplace in front of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came about that whenever Jehudi, in his reading, had got through three or four divisions, the king, cutting them with his penknife, put them into the fire, till all the book was burned up in the fire which was burning in the fireplace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they had no fear and gave no signs of grief, not the king or any of his servants, after hearing all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made a strong request to the king not to let the book be burned, but he would not give ear to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king gave orders to Jerahmeel, the king's son, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the Lord kept them safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then after the book, in which Baruch had put down the words of Jeremiah, had been burned by the king, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take another book and put down in it all the words which were in the first book, which Jehoiakim, king of Judah, put into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And about Jehoiakim, king of Judah, you are to say, This is what the Lord has said: You have put this book into the fire, saying, Why have you put in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come, causing the destruction of this land and putting an end to every man and beast in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this reason the Lord has said of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, He will have no son to take his place on the seat of David: his dead body will be put out to undergo the heat of the day and the cold of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will send punishment on him and on his seed and on his servants for their evil-doing; I will send on them and on the people of Jerusalem and the men of Judah, all the evil which I said against them, but they did not give ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jeremiah took another book, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who put down in it, from the mouth of Jeremiah, all the words of the book which had been burned in the fire by Jehoiakim, king of Judah: and in addition a number of other words of the same sort.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
