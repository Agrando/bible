And I said, I see a branch of an almond-tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Lord said to me, You have seen well: for I keep watch over my word to give effect to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot, and its face is from the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Lord said to me, Out of the north evil will come, bursting out on all the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For see, I will send for all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the Lord; and they will come, everyone placing his high seat at the way into Jerusalem, and against its walls on every side, and against all the towns of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will give my decision against them on account of all their evil-doing; because they have given me up, burning perfumes to other gods and worshipping the works of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So make yourself ready, and go and say to them everything I give you orders to say: do not be overcome by fear of them, or I will send fear on you before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For see, this day have I made you a walled town, and an iron pillar, and walls of brass, against all the land, against the kings of Judah, against its captains, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They will be fighting against you, but they will not overcome you: for I am with you, says the Lord, to give you salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
