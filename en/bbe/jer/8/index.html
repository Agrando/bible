But see, the false pen of the scribes has made it false.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The wise men are shamed, they are overcome with fear and taken: see, they have given up the word of the Lord; and what use is their wisdom to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will take them for themselves: for everyone, from the least to the greatest, is given up to getting money; from the priest even to the prophet, everyone is false.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they have made little of the wounds of the daughter of Zion, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things. They had no shame, they were not able to become red with shame: so they will come down with those who are falling: in the time of their punishment they will be made low, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will put an end to them completely, says the Lord: there are no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why are we seated doing nothing? come together, and let us go to the walled towns, and let destruction overtake us there, for the Lord our God has sent destruction on us, and given us bitter water for our drink, because we have done evil against the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We were looking for peace, but no good came; and for a time of well-being, but there is only a great fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The loud breathing of the horses comes to our ears from Dan: at the sound of the outcry of his war-horses, all the land is shaking with fear; for they have come, and have made a meal of the land and everything in it; the town and the people living in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>See, I will send snakes and poison-snakes among you, against which the wonder-worker has no power; and they will give you wounds which may not be made well, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Sorrow has come on me! my heart in me is feeble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The voice of the cry of the daughter of my people comes from a far land: Is the Lord not in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they made me angry with their images and their strange gods which are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The grain-cutting is past, the summer is ended, and no salvation has come to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the destruction of the daughter of my people I am broken: I am dressed in the clothing of grief; fear has taken me in its grip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is there no life-giving oil in Gilead? is there no expert in medical arts? why then have my people not been made well?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
