what is our wrongdoing and what is our sin which we have done against the Lord our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then you will say to them, Because your fathers have given me up, says the Lord, and have gone after other gods and become their servants and their worshippers, and have given me up and have not kept my law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you have done worse evil than your fathers; for see, every one of you is guided by the pride of his evil heart, so as not to give ear to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this reason I will send you away out of this land into a land which is strange to you, to you and to your fathers; there you will be the servants of other gods day and night, and you will have no mercy from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this cause, see, the days are coming, says the Lord, when it will no longer be said, By the living Lord, who took the children of Israel up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, By the living Lord, who took the children of Israel up out of the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had sent them: and I will take them back again to their land which I gave to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>See, I will send for great numbers of fishermen, says the Lord, and they will take them like fish in a net; and after that, I will send for numbers of bowmen, and they will go after them, driving them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For my eyes are on all their ways: there is no cover for them from my face, and their evil-doing is not kept secret from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will give them the reward of their evil-doing and their sin twice over; because they have made my land unclean, and have made my heritage full of the bodies of their unholy and disgusting things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, my strength and my strong tower, my safe place in the day of trouble, the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth, and say, The heritage of our fathers is nothing but deceit, even false things in which there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Will a man make for himself gods which are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this reason, truly, I will make them see, this once I will give them knowledge of my hand and my power; and they will be certain that my name is the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
