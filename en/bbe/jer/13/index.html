Where is the flock which was given to you, your beautiful flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What will you say when he puts over you those whom you yourself have made your friends? will not pains take you like a woman in childbirth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if you say in your heart, Why have these things come on me? because of the number of your sins, your skirts have been uncovered and violent punishment overtakes you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Is it possible for the skin of the Ethiopian to be changed, or the markings on the leopard? Then it might be possible for you to do good, who have been trained to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So I will send them in all directions, as dry grass is taken away by the wind of the waste land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is your fate, the part measured out to you by me, says the Lord, because you have put me out of your memory and put your faith in what is false.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So I will have your skirts uncovered before your face, in order that your shame may be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen your disgusting acts, even your false behaviour and your cries of desire and your loose ways on the hills in the field. Unhappy are you, O Jerusalem, you have no desire to be made clean; how long will you be in turning back to me?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
