Sorrow is ours, for destruction has come on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O Jerusalem, make your heart clean from evil, so that you may have salvation. How long are evil purposes to have a resting-place in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a voice is sounding from Dan, giving out evil from the hills of Ephraim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make this come to the minds of the nations, make a statement openly against Jerusalem, that attackers are coming from a far country and their voices will be loud against the towns of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Like keepers of a field they are against her on every side; because she has been fighting against me, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your ways and your doings have made these things come on you; this is your sin; truly it is bitter, going deep into your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My soul, my soul! I am pained to my inmost heart; my heart is troubled in me; I am not able to be quiet, because the sound of the horn, the note of war, has come to my ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>News is given of destruction on destruction; all the land is made waste: suddenly my tents, straight away my curtains, are made waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long will I go on seeing the flag and hearing the sound of the war-horn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For my people are foolish, they have no knowledge of me; they are evil-minded children, without sense, all of them: they are wise in evil-doing, but have no knowledge of doing good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Looking at the earth, I saw that it was waste and without form; and to the heavens, that they had no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Looking at the mountains, I saw them shaking, and all the hills were moved about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Looking, I saw that there was no man, and all the birds of heaven had gone in flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Looking, I saw that the fertile field was a waste, and all its towns were broken down before the Lord and before his burning wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this is what the Lord has said: All the land will become a waste; I will make destruction complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The earth will be weeping for this, and the heavens on high will be black: because I have said it, and I will not go back from it; it is my purpose, and it will not be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>All the land is in flight because of the noise of the horsemen and the bowmen; they have taken cover in the woodland and up on the rocks: every town has been given up, not a man is living in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you, when you are made waste, what will you do? Though you are clothed in red, though you make yourself beautiful with ornaments of gold, though you make your eyes wide with paint, it is for nothing that you make yourself fair; your lovers have no more desire for you, they have designs on your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>A voice has come to my ears like the voice of a woman in birth-pains, the pain of one giving birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, fighting for breath, stretching out her hands, saying, Now sorrow is mine! for my strength is gone from me before the takers of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
