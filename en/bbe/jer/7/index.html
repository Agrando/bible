Truly I, even I, have seen it, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But go now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I put my name at first, and see what I did to it because of the evil-doing of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, because you have done all these works, says the Lord, and I sent my word to you, getting up early and sending, but you did not give ear; and my voice came to you, but you gave no answer:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this reason I will do to the house which is named by my name, and in which you have put your faith, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will send you away from before my face, as I have sent away all your brothers, even all the seed of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as for you (Jeremiah), make no prayers for this people, send up no cry or prayer for them, make no request for them to me: for I will not give ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The children go for wood, the fathers get the fire burning, the women are working the paste to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and drink offerings are drained out to other gods, moving me to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Are they moving me to wrath? says the Lord; are they not moving themselves to their shame?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So this is what the Lord God has said: See, my wrath and my passion will be let loose on this place, on man and beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the produce of the earth; it will be burning and will not be put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These are the words of the Lord of armies, the God of Israel: Put your burned offerings with your offerings of beasts, and take flesh for your food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I said nothing to your fathers, and gave them no orders, on the day when I took them out of Egypt, about burned offerings or offerings of beasts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this was the order I gave them, saying, Give ear to my voice, and I will be your God, and you will be my people: go in all the way ordered by me, so that all may be well for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they took no note and did not give ear, but were guided by the thoughts and the pride of their evil hearts, going back and not forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>From the day when your fathers came out of Egypt till this day, I have sent my servants the prophets to you, getting up early every day and sending them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But still they took no note and would not give ear, but they made their necks stiff, doing worse than their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you are to say all these words to them, but they will not give ear to you: you will send out your voice to them, but they will give no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you are to say to them, This is the nation which has not given ear to the voice of their God, or taken his teaching to heart: good faith is dead and is cut off from their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let your hair be cut off, O Jerusalem, and let it go, and let a song of grief go up on the open hilltops; for the Lord is turned away from the generation of his wrath and has given them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the children of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes, says the Lord: they have put their disgusting images in the house which is named by my name, making it unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they have put up the high place of Topheth in the valley of the son of Hinnom, burning their sons and their daughters there in the fire; a thing which was not ordered by me and never came into my mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For this cause, the days are coming, says the Lord, when it will no longer be named Topheth, or, The valley of the son of Hinnom, but, The valley of Death: for they will put the dead into the earth in Topheth till there is no more room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the bodies of this people will be food for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth; and there will be no one to send them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, I will put an end to the laughing voices, the voice of joy and the voice of the newly-married man and the voice of the bride: for the land will become a waste.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
