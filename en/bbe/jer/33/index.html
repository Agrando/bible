For I will let the land come back to its first condition, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is what the Lord of armies has said: Again there will be in this place, which is a waste, without man and without beast, and in all its towns, a resting-place where the keepers of sheep will make their flocks take rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the towns of the hill-country, in the towns of the lowland, and in the towns of the South and in the land of Benjamin and in the country round Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, the flocks will again go under the hand of him who is numbering them, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will give effect to the good word which I have said about the people of Israel and the people of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days and at that time, I will let a Branch of righteousness come up for David; and he will be a judge in righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days, Judah will have salvation and Jerusalem will be safe: and this is the name which will be given to her: The Lord is our righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Lord has said, David will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the priests and the Levites will never be without a man to come before me, offering burned offerings and perfumes and meal offerings and offerings of beasts at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Lord has said: If it is possible for my agreement of the day and the night to be broken, so that day and night no longer come at their fixed times,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then my agreement with my servant David may be broken, so that he no longer has a son to take his place on the seat of the kingdom; and my agreement with the Levites, the priests, my servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As it is not possible for the army of heaven to be numbered, or the sand of the sea measured, so will I make the seed of my servant David, and the Levites my servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Have you taken note of what these people have said, The two families, which the Lord took for himself, he has given up? This they say, looking down on my people as being, in their eyes, no longer a nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Lord has said, If I have not made day and night, and if the limits of heaven and earth have not been fixed by me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then I will give up caring for the seed of Jacob and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will let their fate be changed and will have mercy on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
