Was not this to have knowledge of me? says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But your eyes and your heart are fixed only on profit for yourself, on causing the death of him who has done no wrong, and on violent and cruel acts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So this is what the Lord has said about Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah: They will make no weeping for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they will make no weeping for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They will do to him what they do to the dead body of an ass; his body will be pulled out and placed on the earth outside the doors of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Lebanon and give a cry; let your voice be loud in Bashan, crying out from Abarim; for all your lovers have come to destruction</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My word came to you in the time of your well-being; but you said, I will not give ear. This has been your way from your earliest years, you did not give attention to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the keepers of your sheep will be food for the wind, and your lovers will be taken away prisoners: truly, then you will be shamed and unhonoured because of all your evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O you who are living in Lebanon, making your living-place in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied will you be when pains come on you, as on a woman in childbirth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By my life, says the Lord, even if Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, was the ring on my right hand, even from there I would have you pulled off;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will give you into the hands of those desiring your death, and into the hands of those whom you are fearing, even into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hands of the Chaldaeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I will send you out, and your mother who gave you birth, into another country not the land of your birth; and there death will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land on which their soul's desire is fixed, they will never come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Coniah a broken vessel of no value? is he a vessel in which there is no pleasure? why are they violently sent out, he and his seed, into a land which is strange to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth, give ear to the word of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The Lord has said, Let this man be recorded as having no children, a man who will not do well in all his life: for no man of his seed will do well, seated on the seat of the kingdom of David and ruling again in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
