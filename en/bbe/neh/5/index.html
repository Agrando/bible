And I got together a great meeting of protest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said to them, We have given whatever we were able to give, to make our brothers the Jews free, who were servants and prisoners of the nations: and would you now give up your brothers for a price, and are they to become our property? Then they said nothing, answering not a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I said, What you are doing is not good: is it not the more necessary for you to go in the fear of our God, because of the shame which the nations may put on us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even I and my servants have been taking interest for the money and the grain we have let them have. So now, let us give up this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give back to them this very day their fields, their vine-gardens, their olive-gardens, and their houses, as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil which you have taken from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they said, We will give them back, and take nothing for them; we will do as you say. Then I sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And shaking out the folds of my robe, I said, So may God send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement; even so let him be sent out and made as nothing. And all the meeting of the people said, So be it, and gave praise to the Lord. And the people did as they had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now from the time when I was made ruler of the people in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year till the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my servants have never taken the food which was the right of the ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But earlier rulers who were before me made the people responsible for their upkeep, and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver; and even their servants were lords over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I kept on with the work of this wall, and we got no land for ourselves: and all my servants were helping with the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And more than this, a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers were guests at my table, in addition to those who came to us from the nations round about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the food made ready for one day was one ox and six fat sheep, as well as fowls; and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine: but all the same, I did not take the food to which the ruler had a right, because the people were crushed under a hard yoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Keep in mind, O my God, for my good, all I have done for this people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
