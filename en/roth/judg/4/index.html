So Deborah arose, and went with Barak, towards Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Barak called together Zebulun and Naphtali, towards Kadesh, and there went up at his feetten thousand men,and Deborah, went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, Heber the Kenite, had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the sons of Hobab, father-in-law of Moses,and moved his tent as far as the oak of Zaanaim, which is near Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they told Sisera that Barak, son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Sisera called together all his chariotsnine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him,from Harosheth of the nations, unto the torrent of Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said Deborah unto BarakUp! for, this, is the day on which Yahweh hath delivered Sisera into thy hand, hath not, Yahweh, gone forth before thee? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, with ten thousand men after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Yahweh put to flight Sisera and all the chariots and all the host, with the edge of the sword, before Barak,so Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, Barak, pursued the chariots, and the host, as far as Harosheth of the nations,and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword, there was not left so much as one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, Sisera, had fled on foot, unto the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin, king of Hazer, and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him: Turn aside, my lord, turn aside with me, do not fear. So he turned aside with her into the tent, and she threw over him a coverlet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto herLet me drink, I pray thee, a little water, for I am thirsty. So she opened the bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and spread over him the coverlet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said unto her, Stand at the entrance of the tent,and it shall be, if any man come and ask thee and sayIs there here a man? that thou shalt say, There is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then took Jael, wife of Heber, the tent-pin, and put the mallet in her hand, and went in unto him, softly, and smote the tent-pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground,he being fast asleep and shrouded in darkness, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And lo!
