And remember that, your bone and your flesh, am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So the brethren of his mother spake for him, in the ears of all the owners of Shechem, all these words,and their heart inclined after Abimelech, for they saidOur own brother, is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So they gave him seventy pieces of silver, out of the house of Baal-berith,and Abimelech hired therewith, loose and unstable men, and they followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he entered the house of his father, at Ophrah, and slew his brethren, sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, upon one stone,but there remained Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, for he had hidden himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then were gathered together all the owners of Shechem, and all the house of Millo, and they went and made Abimelech king,by the oak of the pillar, that was in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, when it was told Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried aloud,and said unto themHearken unto me, ye owners of Shechem, and may God, hearken unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The trees, went their way, to anoint over them, a king,and they said unto the olive treeReign thou over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, which, in me, gods and men do honour,and go to wave to and fro, over the trees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said the trees unto the fig-tree,Come!

thou, reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the vine said unto them, Should I leave my new wine, that rejoiceth gods and men,and go to wave to and fro, over the trees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said all the trees, unto the bramble,Come, thou, to reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the bramble said unto the trees, If, in truth, ye are about to anoint me to be king over you, come, take refuge in my shade,but, if not, there shall come forth fire out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, therefore, if, in truth and sincerity, ye have acted, in making Abimelech king,and if ye have dealt, well, with Jerubbaal and with his house, and if, according to the deserving of his hands, ye have done unto him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>in that my father fought for you, and cast his soul away from before him, and rescued you out of the hand of Midian;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>yet have, ye, risen up against the house of my father, to-day, and slain his sonsseventy men, upon one stone,and made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king over the owners of Shechem, because he is, your brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>if then, in truth and in sincerity, ye have dealt with Jerubbaal and with his house, this day, rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let, him also, rejoice in you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but, if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the owners of Shechem, and the house of Millo,and let fire come out from the owners of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jotham hasted away, and fled, and went to Beer,and dwelt there, away from the face of Abimelech his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then God let go a spirit of mischief between Abimelech and the owners of Shechem,and the owners of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>that the cruel wrong to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might   ,and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the owners of Shechem who strengthened his hands, to slay his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the owners of Shechem set for him liers in wait, upon the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who crossed over them by the road,and it was told Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Gaal son of Ebed came, with his brethren, and they passed through to Shechem,and the owners of Shechem put their trust in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then went they out into the fields, and gathered the fruit of their vineyards and trode   , and held a vintage festival,and entered the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and poured contempt on Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Gaal son of Ebed said: Who is Abimelechand who is the son of Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? Serve ye the men of Hamor, Shechems father, but why should, we, serve him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Would, then, this people were in my hand! that I might set aside Abimelech,and say to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, when Zubul, governor of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, then was kindled his anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he sent messengers unto Abimelech, by deceit, saying,Lo! Gaal son of Ebed, and his brethren, are coming into Shechem; and lo! are fortifying the city against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and it shall be, in the morning, about sunrise, thou shalt get up early, and spread thyself out against the city,when lo! he and the people that are with him coming out against thee, so shalt thou do unto him as thy hand shall find opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Abimelech rose up,, and all the people that were with him, by night,and they lay in wait above Shechem, in four companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then came forth Gaal son of Ebed, and took his stand at the opening of the gate of the city,so Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the place of ambush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, when Gaal saw the people, he said unto Zebul, Lo! people coming down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, The shadow of the mountains, thou seest, like men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then did Gaal yet further speak, and sayLo! people coming down from the highest part of the land,and one company, coming in by way of the Conjurers Terebinth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then Zebul said unto himWhere, then, is thy mouth that kept on saying, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? Is not, this, the people which thou didst despise? Go forth, I pray thee, now, and fight with them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gaal went forth before the owners of Shechem,and fought against Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him,and there fell a multitude of slain as far as the entering of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then dwelt Abimelech in Arumah,and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it came to pass, on the morrow, that the people went forth into the field,and they told Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So he took the people and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field,and he looked, and lo! the people coming forth out of the city, so he rose up against them, and smote them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, spread themselves out, and   took their stand at the opening of the gate of the city,while, the two companies, spread themselves out against all that were in the field, and smote them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, Abimelech, fought against the city, all that day, and captured the city, the people also that were therein, he slew,and brake down the city, and sowed it with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And, when all the owners of the tower of Shechem heard, they entered into the basement of the house of El-berith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And it was told Abimelech, that all the owners of the tower of Shechem had gathered themselves together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So Abimelech went up Mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him, and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and lifted it, and laid it on his shoulder,and said unto the people that were with himWhat ye have seen me do, haste! do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So, even all the people cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and laid them over the basement, and set it on fire over them who were therein,even all the men of the tower of Shechem died about a thousand men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then went Abimelech unto Thebez,and encamped against Thebez, and captured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Now, a strong tower, was in the midst of the city, and there fled thither all the men and the women, and all the owners of the city, and shut themselves in,and went up on the roof of the tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Abimelech came in as far as the tower, and fought against it,and so came near, as far as the entrance of the tower, to burn it with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon the head of Abimelech,and brake in pieces his skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then called he hastily unto the young man bearing his armour, and said unto himDraw thy sword, and put me to death, lest they say of me, A woman, slew him! So his young man thrust him through, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And, when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was, dead, they went their way every man to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Thus did God requite the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>all the wickedness also, of the men of Shechem, did God requite upon their own head,and so brought in upon, them the curse of Jotham, son of Jerubbaal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
