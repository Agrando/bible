Then said the sons of Israel, Tell   , In what manner was brought to pass this vileness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Levite, husband of the woman that was cut in pieces, responded and said,Into Gibeah that pertaineth to Benjamin, I entered, I and my concubine, to tarry the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the owners of Gibeah rose up against me, and beset the house, for my sake, by night,me, they thought to slay, and, my concubine, they so humbled, that she died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So I laid hold on my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel,because they had wrought lewdness and impiety, in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo! ye all, are sons of Israel,give your word and counsel, here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then arose all the people, as one man, saying,No man of us will go to his tent, and no man of us will turn aside to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, therefore, this is the thing, that we will do to Gibeah,  against it by lot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and we will take ten men of a hundred, of all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people,that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the impiety that it hath wrought in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So all the men of Israel were gathered together against the city, as one man knit together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the tribes of Israel sent men throughout all the divisions of Benjamin, saying,What is this vile thing that hath been brought to pass, among you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, therefore, deliver up the menthe sons of the Abandoned Onewho are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and vileness be consumed out of Israel. But   Benjamin would not hearken unto the voice of their brethren, the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then did the sons of Benjamin gather themselves together out of the cities, unto Gibeah,to go forth to battle against the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the sons of Benjamin were numbered on that day, out of the cities, twenty-six thousand men, that drew the sword,besides, of the inhabitants of Gibeah, were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Out of all this people, were seven hundred chosen men, left-handed,any one of whom could sling with a stone to a hairs-breadth, and not miss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, the men of Israel, were numbered, apart from Benjamin, four hundred thousand men, that drew the sword,every one of these being a man of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked of God, and the sons of Israel said, Who shall go up for us first, to fight against the sons of Benjamin?
