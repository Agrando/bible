And he saidSilence! Thereupon went out from his presence all who had been standing near him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, Ehud, came in unto him, he, having been sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself, alone, and Ehud said, A divine word, have I, unto thee. So he arose from off his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from off his right thigh,and thrust it into his body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and, the handle also, went in after the blade, and the flesh closed upon the blade, for he withdrew not the sword out of his body,and he came out into the ante-chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, when Ehud came out into the porch, he closed the doors of the parlour upon him, and bolted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When, he, had come out, his servants, went in, and looked, and lo! the doors of the parlour were bolted,so they said, Surely he covereth his feet, in the summer chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, though they tarried a long time, yet lo! he opened not the doors of the parlour,so they took the key, and opened   , when lo! their lord, fallen to the ground dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, Ehud, escaped while they delayed,yea, he, passed the images, and escaped into Seirah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And so it was, when he came, that he blew with a horn, throughout the hill country of Ephraim,and the sons of Israel came down with him, out of the hill country, he, being before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto themCome down after me, for Yahweh hath delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand. So they came down after him, and captured the fords of the Jordan, towards Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they smote of Moab, at that time, about ten thousand men, every one a mighty man, and every one a man of valour,and, there escaped not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moab was subdued on that day, under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years, and Ehud judged them until his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, after him, was Shamgar, son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad,and, he also, saved Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
