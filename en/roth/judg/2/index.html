And he saidI led you up out of Egypt, and brought you into the land, which I had sworn unto your fathers, And I said, I will not break my covenant with you, to times age-abiding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But, ye, must not solemnise a covenant with the inhabitants of this land, Their altars, must ye tear down,But ye have not hearkened unto my voice, what is this ye have done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wherefore also I said, I will not drive them out from before you,but they shall be your adversaries, and, their gods, shall become unto you a snare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, when the messenger of Yahweh had spoken these words unto all the sons of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they called the name of that place, Bochim, and offered sacrifice there, unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, when Joshua had let the people go, the sons of Israel went their way, every man to his inheritance, to take possession of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua,and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh which he had wrought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So then Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died,being a hundred and ten years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they buried him within the bounds of his inheritance, in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim,on the north of Mount Gaash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All that generation also, were gathered unto their fathers,and there arose another generation, after them, who had not known Yahweh, nor even the work which he had wrought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the sons of Israel did the thing that was wicked in the sight of Yahweh,and served the Baals;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt, and went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them,and angered Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, they forsook Yahweh,and did service unto the Baal and unto Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then kindled the anger of Yahweh upon Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of spoilers, who plundered them,and he sold them into the hand of their enemies round about, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was found to be against them for misfortune, as spake Yahweh, and as sware Yahweh unto them,and they were distressed exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, though Yahweh raised up judges,who saved them out of the hand of them that plundered them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yet, even unto their judges, did thy not hearken, for they went unchastely astray after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them,they turned aside speedily out of the way wherein their fathers who hearkened unto the commandments of Yahweh, walked, they did not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, when Yahweh raised them up judges, then was Yahweh with the judges, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies, all the days of the judge,for Yahweh was grieved at their outcry, because of them who oppressed them, and ill-treated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, when the judge was dead, they again broke faith more than their fathers, by going their way after other gods, by serving them, and bowing themselves down to them,they ceased not from their doings nor from their stubborn way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So then the anger of Yahweh kindled upon Israel, and he saidForasmuch as this nation have transgressed my covenant, which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I also, will no further dispossess a man from before them,from among the nations which Joshua left remaining, when he died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>that I may, by them, put Israel to the proof,whether they are going to be observant of the way of Yahweh, to walk therein as their fathers observed it, or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus then Yahweh left these nations, not dispossessing them speedily,neither had he delivered them into the hand of Joshua</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
