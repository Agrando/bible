Wherefore then, are ye come unto me, now, when ye are in distress?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the elders of Gilead said unto JephthahTherefore, have we, now, returned unto thee, that, if thou go with us, and do battle with the sons of Ammon, then shalt thou become our head, for all the inhabitants of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jephthah said unto the elders of GileadIf ye do bring me back to do battle with the sons of Ammon, and Yahweh deliver them up before me, shall, I myself, become your head?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the elders of Gilead said unto JephthahYahweh himself, will be hearkening between us, if, according to thy word, so, we do not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then went Jephthah with the elders of Gilead, and the people set him over them, as head and commander,and Jephthah spake all his words before Yahweh, in Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the sons of Ammon, saying,What occasion is there between us, that thou shouldst have come unto me, to fight against my land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king of the sons of Ammon said unto the messengers of JephthahBecause Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan,now, therefore, restore them in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jephthah yet once more sent messengers unto the king of the sons of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said a unto him, Thus, saith Jephthah,Israel took not away the land of Moab, or the land of the sons of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for, when they came up out of Egypt, and Israel journeyed through the desert as far as the Red Sea, and came in unto Kadesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then did Israel send messengers unto the king of Edom, sayingLet me pass, I pray thee, through thy land, but the king of Edom hearkened not, unto the king of Moab also, sent they, but he would not consent,so Israel abode in Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then journeyed they through the desert, and went round the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and so came, from the rising of the sun, to the land of Moab, but encamped beyond Arnon,and entered not within the boundary of Moab, for, Arnon, is the boundary of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then did Israel send messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon,and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land as far as my own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Sihon trusted not Israel, to pass through his boundary, so Sihon gathered together all his people, and encamped in Jahaz,and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then did Yahweh, God of Israel, deliver up Sihon, and all his people, into the hand of Israel, and they smote them,so Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites,from Arnon, even as far as the Jabbok, and from the desert, even as far as the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, therefore, it was, Yahweh God of Israel, that dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel,and shalt, thou, possess it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>What Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess, that, wilt thou not possess? and, whatsoever Yahweh our God hath set before us to possess, that, shall we not possess?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, therefore, art thou, really better, than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Hath there been any, striving at all, with Israel, or any, fighting at all, with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>all the time that Israel hath been dwelling in Heshbon and in her towns, and in Aroer and in her towns, and in all the cities that are on the banks of Arnon,for three hundred years? Wherefore, then, have ye not made a rescue within that time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I, therefore, have not sinned against thee; but, thou, art doing me a wrong, in fighting against me,Let Yahweh, the Judge, give judgment today, between the sons of Israel, and the sons of Ammon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the king of the sons of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah, which he sent unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then came upon Jephthah the spirit of Yahweh, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh,and passed through Mizpeh of Gilead, and, from Mizpeh of Gilead, he passed through   the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Yahweh, and said,If thou wilt, deliver, the sons of Ammon into my hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>then shall it be, that, whosoever cometh forth out of the doors of my house, to meet me, when I return successful, from the sons of Ammon, shall belong unto Yahweh, and I will offer him up, as an ascending-sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So then Jephthah passed over unto the sons of Ammon, to fight against them,and Yahweh delivered them into his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he smote them, from Aroer even till thou enterest in to Minnith, even twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with an exceeding great smiting,and thus were the sons of Ammon subdued before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then came Jephthah towards Mizpah, unto his own house, and lo! his daughter, coming forth to meet him, with timbrels, and with dances,and, she, was none other than his only child, he had not, besides her, either son or daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and saidAlas! my daughter, Thou hast, brought me low, Even, thou, hast come to be among them who trouble me,Yet, I, opened wide my mouth unto Yahweh, and cannot go back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And she said unto himMy father! Thou hast opened wide thy mouth unto Yahweh, Do with me, according to that which hath gone forth out of thy mouth,after that Yahweh hath exacted for thee an avenging from thine enemies, from the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she said unto her father, Let this thing, be done for me,Let me alone two months, that I may depart, and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he saidDepart. So he let her go, for two months,and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity, upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass, at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, and he fulfilled on her his vow which he had vowed,she not having known man. And it became a statute, in Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>From year to year, departed the daughters of Israel, to lament aloud for the daughter of Jephthah, the Gileadite, four days in the year.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
