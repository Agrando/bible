But, now, hath Yahweh abandoned us, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yahweh, turned unto him, and saidGo in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel, out of the hand of Midian,have I not sent thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto himPardon, O my Lord! How, shall I save Israel? Lo! my thousand, is the poorest in Manasseh, and, I, am the youngest in the house of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Yahweh said unto himI will be with thee,so shalt thou smite the Midianites, as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said unto him, If, I beseech thee, I have found favour in thine eyes, then wilt thou work for me a sign, that it is, thou, who art speaking with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not, I beseech thee, withdraw from hence, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said: I, will tarry until thou return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So, Gideon, went in, and made ready a kid of the goats, and, of an ephah of meal, unleavened cakes, the flesh, he put in a basket, and, the broth, he put in a pot,and brought them forth unto him, under the oak, and presented them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the messenger of God said unto himTake the flesh and the cakes, and set them on this crag, and, the broth, do thou pour out. And he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the messenger of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff, that was in his hand, and touched the flesh, and the cakes,and there came up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh, and the cakes, and, the messenger of Yahweh, had departed out of his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then saw Gideon that, the messenger of Yahweh, it was,so Gideon saidAlas, My Lord Yahweh! forasmuch as I have seen the messenger of Yahweh, face to face!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Yahweh said unto himPeace be unto thee! Do not fear,thou shalt not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Gideon built there an altar unto Yahweh, and called it, Yahweh-shalom. Unto this day, it remaineth, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, on that night, that Yahweh said unto himTake the young bullock that belongeth to thy father, even the second bullock of seven years,and throw thou down the altar of Baal, that belongeth to thy father, and, the sacred stem that is by it, shalt thou cut down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then shalt thou build an altar, unto Yahweh thy God, on the top of this fort, with the pile,and shalt take the second bullock, and cause it to go up as an ascending-sacrifice, with the wood of the sacred stem which thou shalt cut down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Gideon took ten men from among his servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken unto him,and so it was that, as he too much feared the house of his father, and the men of the city, to do it by day, he did it by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the men of the city rose up early in the morning, and lo! the altar of Baal, had been overthrown, and, the sacred stem that was by it, had been cut down, and the second bullock had been caused to ascend upon the altar that had been built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they said, one to another, Who hath done this thing? And they inquired, and made search, and it was said, Gideon son of Joash, hath done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring forth thy son, that he may die,because he hath overthrown the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the sacred stem that was by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joash said unto all who stood by himWill, ye, plead for Baal, or will, ye, save him? Whoso pleadeth for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning,if, a god, he be let him plead for himself, because one hath overthrown his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So he was called on that day, Jerubbaal, saying,Let Baal, plead against him. Because he had overthrown his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now, all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east, were gathered together,and they crossed over and pitched in the vale of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But, the spirit of Yahweh, clothed Gideon,so he blew with a horn, and Abiezer was gathered after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Messengers also, sent he throughout all Manasseh, and, they also, were gathered after him,messengers also, sent he throughout Asher, and throughout Zebulun, and throughout Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Gideon said unto God,If thou art about to bring salvation, by my hand, unto Israel, as thou hast spoken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>lo! I am placing a woollen fleece, on the threshing-floor,if, dew, be on the fleece alone and, on all the ground, it be dry, then shall I know that thou wilt bring salvation, by my hand, unto Israel, as thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it was so, and he rose up early, on the morrow, and pressed together the fleece,and wrung out the dew from the fleece, a small bowl full of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then said Gideon unto God, Let not thine anger kindle upon me, but let me speak, only this once,Let me, I pray thee, put to the proof, only this once, with the fleece, I pray thee, let it be dry on the fleece alone, while, on all the ground, there be dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And God did so on that night,and it was dry on the fleece alone, while, on all the ground, there was dew.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
