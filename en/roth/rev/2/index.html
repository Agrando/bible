Unto him that overcomethI will give, unto him, to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, unto the messenger of the assembly, in Smyrna, write:These things, saith the first and the last, who became dead, and lived:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know thy tribulation, and destitution, nevertheless, thou art, rich, and the profane speech from among them who affirm that they themselves are, Jews, and they are not, but a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not fear the things which thou art about to suffer. Lo! the adversary is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried, and may have tribulation ten days. Become thou faithful until death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that hath an ear, let him hear what, the Spirit, is saying unto the assemblies.
