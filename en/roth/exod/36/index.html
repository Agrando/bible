So the people were restrained from bringing in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the material was enough for all the work, to make it,and to spare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then did all the wise-hearted among the workers of the material make the habitation of ten curtains, of fine-twined linen, and blue and purple and crimson, with cherubim the work of the skilful weaver, did he make them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The length of each curtain, was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four cubits, for each curtain,one measure, had all the curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he joined the   five curtains, joined he one to another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he made loops of blue upon the border of the first curtain, at the edge of the set,thus, made he in the border of the other curtain at the edge of the second set:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fifty loops, made he in the first curtain, and fifty loops, made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second set,the loops being, opposite, one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he made fifty clasps of gold,and joined the curtains one to another with the clasps, and so the habitation became, one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he made curtains of goats-hair, for the tent over the habitation, eleven curtains, did he make them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>the length of each curtain, was thirty cubits, and, four cubits, was the breath of each curtain,one measure, had the eleven curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he joined five of the curtains by themselves,and the six curtains, by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he made fifty loops upon the border of the curtain that was outmost in the one set and fifty loops, made he upon the border of the curtain of the second set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he made fifty clasps of bronze,to join together the tent, that it might become one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he made a covering to the tent, of rams skins dyed red,and a covering of badgers skins, above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he made the boards for the habitation, of acacia wood, for standing up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>ten cubits, the length of each board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>two tenons to each board, united one to another,thus, made he for all the boards of the habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he made the boards for the habitation, twenty boards, for the south side southwards;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and, forty sockets of silver, made he, under the twenty boards, two sockets, under the first board, for its two tenons, and, two sockets, under the next board for its two tenons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And for the second side of the habitation to the north quarter, made he twenty boards;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and their forty sockets of silver, two sockets, under the first board, and, two sockets, under the next board.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, for the hinder part of the habitation westward, made he six boards;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and two boards, made he for the corners of the habitation,in the hinderpart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus were they to be double beneath, and at the same time, should they be entire, at the top thereof, into each ring, thus, did he for them both, for the two corners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus were there to be eight boards, and, their sockets of silver, were sixteen sockets, two sockets apiece under each board.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he made bars of acacia wood,five, for the boards of the first side of the habitation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and five bars, for the boards of the other side of the habitation, and, five bars, for the boards of the habitation at the hinderpart westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he made the middle bar,to run along in the midst of the boards, from end to end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the boards, overlaid he with gold and their rings, made he of gold, as receptacles for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he made the veil, of blue and purple and crimson and fine-twined linen,of the work of a skilful weaver, made he it, with cherubim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he made for it four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold their hooks of gold, and cast for them, four sockets of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he made a screen for the opening of the tent, of blue and purple and crimson and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the five pillars thereof and their hooks, and he overlaid their capitals and their cross-rods, with gold, but, their five sockets, were of bronze.</span>
