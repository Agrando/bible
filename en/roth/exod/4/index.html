And he saidA staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then said heCast it to the earth. And he cast it to the earth, and it became a serpent,and Moses fled from the face thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Yahweh said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by its tail: So he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that they may believe that Yahweh, God of their fathers,God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then said Yahweh unto him, yet againBring, I pray thee, thy hand, into thy bosom. So he brought his hand, into his bosom,and then took it out, and lo! his hand, was leprous,like snow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he saidPut back thy hand into thy bosom: So he put back his hand into his bosom,and then took it out of his bosom, and lo it had come again like his own flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>thus shall it come to pass, if they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the voice of the first sign, then will they believe the voice of the next sign;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and it shall come to pass if they will not believe even these two signs nor hearken to thy voice, then shalt thou take of the water of the river, and pour it out on the dry land,so shall the water which thou hast taken from the river, become, yea it shall become, blood, on the dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses said unto YahwehPardon, O My Lord! not a man of words, am I, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant,for heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Yahweh said unto himWho appointed a mouth for man, or who appointeth him to be dumb, or deaf, or seeing or blind?
