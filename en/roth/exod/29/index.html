generations, at the opening of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh, where will meet with you, to speak unto thee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So will I meet there with the sons of Israel, and it shall be hallowed by my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thus will I hallow the tent of meeting, and the altar,and, Aaron and his sons, will I hallow, to minister as priests unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thus will I make my habitation in the midst of the sons of Israel, and will be their God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and they shall know that, IYahweh, am their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I might make my habitation in their midst, IYahweh, their God.</span>
