Not against us, do ye murmur but against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the assembly of the sons of Israel, Draw near, before Yahweh,for he hath heard your murmurings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, when Aaron spake unto all the assembly of the sons of Israel, then turned they towards the desert,and lo! the glory of Yahweh, had appeared in the cloud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then spake Yahweh unto Mosessaying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel,speak unto them, sayingBetween the two evenings, shall ye eat flesh, and in the morning, shall ye be filled with bread,so shall ye know that I Yahweh am your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, in the evening, that there came up quail, and covered the camp,and in the morning was the outpouring of dew, round about the camp;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and when the outpouring of dew went up, then lo! on the face of the desert, a thin flake, thin as hoar-frost on the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of Israel saw it they said one to anotherWhat is that? For they knew not what "that" was. Then said Moses unto them, "That" is the bread which Yahweh hath given you to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded, Gather ye thereof, each man what he needeth for eating,an omer a head, by the number of your souls, each manfor them who are in his tent, shall ye take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel did so,and gathered,   less;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and when they measured it with the omer, he who had gathered more had nothing over, and he who had gathered less had no lack: each man what he needed for eating, did they gather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said unto them,Let, no man leave thereof, until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they hearkened not unto Moses, but certain men left thereof until morning, and it swarmed with worms and become loathsome,and Moses was wroth with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus then they gathered it morning by morning, each man what he needed for eating, and as soon as the sun waxed hot, so soon it melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered food twice as much, two omers for each one,so all the princes of the assembly came in, and told Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said unto themThat is what Yahweh spake. The observance of a holy sabbath to Yahweh, is to-morrow,what ye would bake, bake and what ye would boil, boil, and all that is left over, put by you to keep until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they put it by until the morning, as Moses had commanded,and it gave no unpleasant odour, neither was there a worm, therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said MosesEat ye it to-day, for a sabbath, is to-day, unto Yahweh,to-day, ye shall not find it in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six days, shall ye gather it,but on the seventh day, a sabbath, it shall not be therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went forth some of the people to gather,but they found not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said Yahweh unto Moses,How long have ye refused to keep my commandments and my laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See because Yahweh hath given you the sabbath, for this cause, is, he, giving you on the sixth day, food for two days,abide ye every man in his place, let no man go forth from his dwelling, on the seventh day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna,and the same, was like coriander seed white, and the taste thereof, like flat-cake with honey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses saidThis, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded, Fill an omer therefrom as a thing to be preserved to your generations,that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the desert, when I brought you forth out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Moses said unto AaronTake a single basket, and put therein an omer-full of manna,and set it down before Yahweh, as a thing to be preserved to your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As Yahweh gave command unto Moses, so did Aaron set it down before the testimony, as a thing to be preserved,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, the sons of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they entered into the land wherein they were to dwell,the manna, they did eat until they entered into the bounds of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now, an omer, is, the tenth of the ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
