Yahweh unto Moses, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>On the first day of the month, in the first month, shalt thou rear the habitation, of the tent of meeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and thou shalt put therein, the ark of the testimony,and shalt screen the ark with the veil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order what is to be arranged thereupon,and thou shalt bring in the lampstand, and mount the lamps thereof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and thou shalt place the altar of gold for incense, before the ark of the testimony,and put up the screen for the opening of the habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and thou shalt place the altar for the ascending-sacrifice,before the opening of the habitation of the tent of meeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and thou shalt place the laver between the tent of meeting, and the altar, and shalt put therein water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou shalt put up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou shalt take the oil of anointing, and anoint the habitation and all that is therein,and shalt hallow it. and all the furniture thereof so shall it be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shalt anoint the altar of ascending sacrifice, and all its utensils,and hallow the altar, so shall the altar be most holy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and thou shalt anoint the laver and its stand,and shalt hallow it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shalt bring near Aaron and his sons, unto the opening of the teat of meeting,and shalt bathe them in the water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and thou shalt clothe Aaron with the holy garments,and shalt anoint him and hallow him so shall he minister as priest unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His sons also, shalt thou bring near,and shalt clothe them with tunics;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and shalt anoint them as thou didst anoint their father, and they shall minister as priests unto me,so shall their anointing remain to them for an age-abiding priesthood, to their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses did,according to all that Yahweh had commanded him, so did he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus came it to pass, in the first month, in the second year, on the first of the month, that the habitation was reared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea Moses reared the habitation, and placed its sockets, and fixed its boards, and fastened its bars,and reared its pillar</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then spread he abroad the tent upon the habitation, and put the covering of the tent upon it, above,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took and placed the testimony within the ark, and put the staves upon the ark,and placed the propitiatory upon the ark, above;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and brought in the ark into the habitation, and put up the screening veil, and screened over the ark of the testimony,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he placed the table in the tent of meeting,on the side of the habitation northward,outside the veil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and set in order thereupon the arrangement of bread before Yahweh,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he put the lampstand, in the tent of meeting, over against the table,on the side of the habitation southward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and mounted the lamps before Yahweh,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he put the altar of gold in the tent of meeting,before the veil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and burned thereupon the fragrant incense,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he put up the screen of the entrance pertaining to the habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and, the altar of ascending-sacrifice, put he at the entrance of the habitation of the tent of meeting,and he caused to ascend thereupon the ascending-sacrifice, and the meal-offering,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he put the laver, between the tent of meeting, and the altar,and put therein water for bathing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and Moses and Aaron and his sons thenceforth bathed thereat,their hands and their feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>when they were entering into the tent of meeting, and when they were drawing near unto the altar, then used they to bathe,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he reared the court round about to the habitation and to the altar, and put up the screen of the gate of the court,and Moses finished the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then did the cloud cover the tent of meeting,and, the glory of Yahweh, filled the habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud had made its habitation thereupon,and the glory of Yahweh, filled the habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And whensoever the cloud ascended from off the habitation, then did the sons of Israel set forward, in all their journeyings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but if the cloud did not ascend, then did they not set forwarduntil the day when it did ascend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For, the cloud of Yahweh, was upon the habitation by day, and, a fire, came to be by night therein,in the sight of all the house of Israel in all their journeyings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
