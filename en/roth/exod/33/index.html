Shall it not be, by thy going on with us? So shall we be more distinguished, I, and thy people, than any people that are on the face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Yahweh unto Moses: Even this thing, which thou hast spoken, will I doFor thou hast found favour in mine eyes, And I have acknowledged thee by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said,Show me, I pray thee, thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said,I, will cause all my goodness to pass before thee. And will proclaim myself by the name Yahweh, before thee, And will show favour, unto whom I may show favour, And will have compassion on whom I may have compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But be saidThou canst not see my face, For no son of earth can see me, and life</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Yahweh, said, Lo! a place near me,So then thou shalt station thyself upon the rock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it shall be while my glory passeth by, I will put thee in the cleft of the rock,and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then will I take away my hand, and thou shalt see behind me, But, my face, must not be seen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
