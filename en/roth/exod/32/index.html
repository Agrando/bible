And Aaron made proclamation, and said, A festival to Yahweh, to-morrow!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they rose up early, on the morrow, and offered ascending-sacrifices, and brought near peace-offerings, and the people sat down, to eat and to drink, and then rose upto make sport!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then spake Yahweh unto MosesGo get thee down, for thy people whom thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them, they have made for themselvesa molten calf, and have bowed themselves down thereto mad have sacrificed thereto, and have said. These, are thy gods, O Israel, who have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then Yahweh said unto Moses,I have looked on this people, and lo! a stiff-necked people, it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now, therefore, let me alone, that mine anger may kindle upon them and that I may consume them, and may make of thee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses besought the face of Yahweh his God,and saidWherefore, O Yahweh, should thine anger kindle upon thy people, whom thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great might and with a firm hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore should the Egyptians speak sayingFor mischief, hath he taken them forth to slay them among the mountains, and to make an end of them from off the face of the ground? Turn thou from the kindling of thine anger, and be grieved over the calamity to thy people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Have remembrance of Abraham, of Isaac and of Israel thy servants to whom thou didst swear by thyself, and didst speak unto them saying, I will multiply your seed, as the stars of the heavens,and, all this land of which I have spoken, will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it to times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So then Yahweh was grieved,over the calamitywhich he had spoken of inflicting on his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turned and went down out of the mount, with the two tables of testimony in his hand,tables written upon on both sides of them, on this and on that, were they written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now as for, the tables, the work of God, they were,and, as for the writing, the writing of God, it was, graven upon the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,so he said unto MosesThe noise of war, in the camp!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he saidNot the noise of the cry of heroism, nor yet the noise of the cry of defeat,the noise of alternate song, do I hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass when he drew near unto the camp, and saw the calf, and the dancings, that the anger of Moses kindled, and he cast out of his hands the tables, and brake them in pieces at the foot of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then took he the calf which they had made and burned it in the fire, and ground it till it became powder, and strewed it on the face of the waters, and made the sons of Israel drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, What had this people done to thee,that thou shouldst have brought upon them a great sin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord kindle,thou thyself, knowest the people, that ready for mischief, they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they said to meMake for us gods, who shall go before us,for, as for this, Mosesthe man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath befallen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I said to themWhosoever hath gold let them break it off, So they gave it to me,and I cast it into the fire, and there came outthis calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses saw the people, that unbridled, they were,for Aaron had given them the rein, for a whispering, among their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Moses took his stand in the gate of the camp, and saidWho is for Yahweh? To me! Then gathered unto him all the sons of Levi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to themThus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh,pass through and return from gate to gate in the camp, and slay ye every man his brother and every man his friend and every man his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the sons of Levi did, according to the word of Moses,and there fell from among the people on that day, about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses saidInstall yourselves to-day, unto Yahweh, yea every man for his son and for his brother,so will he bestow upon you to-day, a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye, have sinned a great sin,Now, therefore, I must go up unto Yahweh, Peradventure, I may make a propitiatory-covering for your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Moses returned unto Yahweh, and said,Oh now, this people hath sinned a great sin, and they have made for themselvesgods of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, therefore, if thou wilt forgive their sin, but if not, blot me I pray thee out of thy book, which thou hast written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Yahweh said unto Moses,Him who hath sinned against me, must I blot out of my book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now, therefore, go lead the people to the place of which I spake to thee, lo! a my messenger, shall go before thee,But, in the day when I do visit, then wilt I visit upon them their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Yahweh plagued the people,for what they had done with the calf, which Aaron made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
