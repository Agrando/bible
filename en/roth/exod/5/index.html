I know not Yahweh, and certainly. Israel, will I not let go!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us,let us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the desert and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore O Moses and Aaron should ye loose the people from their works? Get you to your burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh said, Lo! manynow, are the people of the land,and are ye to make them rest from their burdens?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So then Pharaoh gave command on that day, unto the taskmasters over the people and unto their overseerssaying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye shall no more give straw unto the people, for making the bricks as heretofore: Let them, go, themselves, so shall they gather for themselves straw:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless, the fixed number of bricks, which they have been making heretofore, shall ye lay upon them, ye shall not diminish therefrom,for idle, they are, on this account, it is that they are making an outcry, saying, We must go our way, we must sacrifice to our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The service must be made heavy on the men that they may labour on it,and let them not pay regard to words of falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then went forth the taskmasters of the people and their overseers, and spake unto the people,saying,Thus, saith Pharaoh, I am not going to give you straw,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ye yourselves go fetch you straw, of any ye can find,yet hath there not been diminished from your service a single thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people dispersed themselves throughout all the land of Egypt,to gather stubble for straw:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the taskmasters, meanwhile, being urgent saying,Complete your works, The task of a day, in its day, as when the straw was provided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then were beaten the overseers of the sons of Israel, whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh had set over them saying: Wherefore have ye not completed your task for making bricks, as heretofore, so also, yesterday and, to-day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then came in the overseers of the sons of Israel, and made outcry unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore shouldst thou do thus to thy servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No straw, is given to thy servants, yet bricks,they keep saying to usmake ye!
