Therefore, the world understandeth us not, because it understood not him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beloved! now, are we, children of God; and, not yet, hath it been made manifest, what we shall be,We know that, if it should be made manifest, like unto him, shall we be, because we shall see him, just as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And, whosoever hath this hope on him, is purifying himself, just as, He, is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whosoever is committing sin, lawlessness also, is committing, and, sin, is, lawlessness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye know, that, He, was made manifestin order that, our sins, he should take away, and, sin, in him, is there none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whosoever, in him, doth abide, is not sinning: whosoever is sinning, hath not seen him, and doth not understand him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Dear children! Let, no one, lead you astray! He that is doing righteousness, is, righteous, just as, He, is righteous:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that is committing sin, is, of the adversary, because, from the beginning, the adversary is sinning. To this end, was the Son of God made manifest, in order that he might undo the works of the adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whosoever hath been born of God, is not committing, sin, because, a seed of him, within him, abideth; and he cannot be committing sin, because, of God, hath he been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Herein, are, manifest, the children of God, and the children of the adversary: Whoever is not doing righteousness, is not of God, nor yet he that is not loving his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because, this, is the message which ye have heard from the beginningthat we should be loving one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not just as, Cain, was, of the wicked one, and slew his brother! And, for what cause, slew he him? Because, his works, were, wicked, whereas, those of his brother, were, righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be not marveling, brethren, if, the world, is hating you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We, know, that we have passed over out of death into life, because we love the brethren: he that loveth not, abideth in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever is hating his brother, is, a murderer; and ye know that, no murderer, hath life age-during, within him abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hereby, have we come to understand love: in that, He, for us, his life laid down; and, we, ought, for the brethren, our lives to lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, whoso hath this worlds goods, and beholdeth his brother having, need, and shutteth up his tender affections from him, how, is, the love of God, abiding in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Dear children! Let us not be loving in word, nor yet with the tongue, but in deed and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hereby, shall we get to know, that, of the truth, we are, and, before him, shall persuade our heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because, if our own heart condemn us, greater, is God, than our heart, and perceiveth all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved! if our heart be not condemning us, boldness, have we, towards God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, whatsoever we are asking, we are receiving from him, because, his commandments, are we keeping, and, the things that are pleasing before him, are we doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, this, is his commandment,that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and be loving one anotherjust as he gave a commandment unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, he that keepeth his commandments, in him, abideth, and, he, in him. And, hereby, perceive we, that he abideth in us, by reason of the Spirit which, unto us, he hath given.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
