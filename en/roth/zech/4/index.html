And I saidI have looked, and lo! a Lampstandall of gold, with the Bowl thereof upon the top thereof, and its Seven Lamps upon it, Seven Pipes each, to the lamps which are upon the top thereof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and, Two Olive-trees, by it,one upon the right hand of the bowl, and one upon the left hand thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then responded I, and said unto the messenger who was speaking with me, saying,What are these, my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then answered the messenger who was speaking with me, and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these, are? And I said, No my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then responded he, and spake unto me, saying, This, is the word of Yahweh, unto Zerubbabel, saying,Not by wealth, nor by strength, but by my spirit, saith Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who, art, thou, O great mountain?
