I am delivering up mankind, every man into the hand of his neighbour, and into the hand of his king, and they will crush the earth, nor will I deliver out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I tended the flock doomed to slaughter, for the sheep-merchants,and took unto me two staves, the one, I called Grace, and, the other, I called Union, thus I tended the sheep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I sent off three shepherds, in one month,for impatient was my soul with them, moreover also, their soul, felt a loathing against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Il will not tend you,the dying, may die, and, the disappearing, may disappear, and, the remainder, may devour one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I took my staff Grace, and cut it in two,that I might set aside my covenant which I had solemnised with all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When it was broken, on that day, then did the sheep- merchants who were watching me, know, that, the word of Yahweh, it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said I unto them, If it be good in your eyes, give me my wage, and, if not, forbear. So they weighed out my wage, thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said Yahweh unto me, Cast it into the treasury, the magnificent price at which I had been valued by them! So I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them, in the house of Yahweh, into the treasury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then cut I in two my second staff, even Union,that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said Yahweh unto me,Yet further take thee the implements of a worthless shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For lo!
