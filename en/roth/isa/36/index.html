Or hast thou on thy part trusted upon Egypt, for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, now, is it, without Yahweh, that I have come up against this land to destroy it? Yahweh himself, said unto me, Go thou up against this land and destroy it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Eliakim, and Shebna, and Joah, unto RabshakehSpeak we pray thee unto thy servants in the Syrian language, for we, can, understand, it,and do not speak unto us in the Jews language, in the ears of the people who are upon the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Rabshakeh saidIs it unto thy lord and unto thee, that my lord hath sent me, to speak these things? Is it not concerning the men who are tarrying upon the wall, that they may eat and drink what cometh from them, with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So then Rabshakeh took his stand, and cried out with a loud voice, in the Jews language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus, saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you,for he shall not be able to deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Yahweh saying, Yahweh, will certainly deliver, us,this city shall not be given over, into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not hearken unto Hezekiah,for, thus, saith the king of Assyria, Deal with me thankfully, and come out unto me, Then shall ye eat, Every one of his own vine and Every one of his own fig-tree, And drink every one the Waters of his own cistern:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Until I come and take you, into A land like your own land,A land of corn and new wine, A land of bread and vineyards:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lest Hezekiah, persuade you, saying, Yahweh will deliver us! Have the gods of the nations, delivered,any one of themhis country, out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad, Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? If indeed they had only delivered Samaria, out of my hand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who are they, among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand? That, Yahweh, should deliver, Jerusalem, out of my hand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word,for the command of the king, it was, saying,Ye must not answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came inEliakim son of Hilkiah who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, unto Hezekiah, with rent clothes,and they told him the words of Rabshakeh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
