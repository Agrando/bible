Or, which of my creditors, is it to whom I have sold you? Lo! for your iniquities, have ye been sold, And for your transgressions, hath your mother been put away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Wherefore, When I came in, was there no one? When I called, was there none to answer? Is mine own hand, really shortened, that it cannot redeem? Or is there not, in me, strength to deliver? Lo! by my rebuke, I dry up the sea I make rivers a desert, Their fish Stinketh, for want of water, Yea dieth, for thirst:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens with gloom, And, of sackcloth, make I their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My Lord Yahweh, hath given unto me the tongue of the instructed, That I should know how to succour the fainting, with discourse,He kept wakeningmorning by morning. He kept wakening mine ear, to hearken as do the instructed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My Lord, Yahweh, opened mine ear, And, I, was not rebellious,Away, turned I not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My back, gave I to smiters, and My cheeks, to them who pulled out the beard,My face, hid I not from insult and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because, My Lord, Yahweh, would help me, Therefore was I not deterred by insult,Therefore did I set my face like flint, And I knew that I should not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>At hand, is one who can justify me. Who will contend with me? let, us stand forth together,Who can accuse me? let him draw near to me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lo! My Lord, Yahweh, will help me, Who is he that shall prove me lawless? Lo! they all, as a garment, shall fall to pieces, the moth shall consume them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who among you, revereth Yahweh, Hearkening unto the voice of his Servant,That hath walked in dark places And hath had no gleam of light? Let him trust in the name of Yahweh, And lean upon his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Lo! all ye that kindle a fire, That gird yourselves with fiery darts,Walk ye in the blaze of your own fire. And in the fiery darts ye have kindled, At my hand, hath this befallen you, In sorrow, shall ye lie down.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
