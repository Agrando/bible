Yea the son of the earth-born who firmly graspeth it! Keeping the sabbath lest he profane it, and Keeping his own hand from doing any wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And let not the son of the foreigner, who hath joined himself unto Yahweh, speak, saying, Yahweh, will separate, me from his people, Neither let the eunuch, say, Lo! I, am a tree dried up!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus, saith YahwehOf the eunuchs, Who shall keep my sabbaths, And choose what I delight in,And lay firm hold on my covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That I will give unto themIn my house, And within my walls, A sign and a name, better than sons and daughters,A name age-abiding, will I give him, which shall not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, as for the sons of the foreignerWho have joined themselves unto Yahweh To wait upon him, and To love the name of Yahweh, To become his for servants,Every one who keepeth the sabbath, lest he profane it.
