And, the arm of Yahweh, to whom was it revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When he came up as a sapling before him. And as a root-sprout out of dry ground, He had neither beauty nor majesty,When we beheld him, there was nothing to behold, that we should desire him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Despised was he, and forsaken of men, Man of pains and familiar with sickness,Yea, like one from whom the face is hidden, Despised, and we esteemed him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet surely, our sicknesses, he, carried, And, as for our pains, he bare the burden of them,But, we, accounted him stricken. Smitten of God and humbled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yet, he, was pierced for transgressions that were ours, was crushed for iniquities that were ours,the chastisement for our well-being, was upon him, And by his stripes, there is healing for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We all, like sheep, had gone astray, Every manto his way, had we burned,And Yahweh! caused to light upon him The guilt of, us all!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hard pressedyet, he, humbled himself Nor opened his mouthAs, a lamb, to the slaughter, is led, And, as a sheep, before her shearers, is dumbNor opened his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By constraint and by sentence, was he taken away, And of his age, who considered That he was cut off out of the land of the living, For my peoples transgression, did the stroke fall on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, appointed with lawless men, was his grave, And with the wicked, his tomb,Though no violence, had he done, Nor was guile in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet, Yahweh, purposed to bruise him, He laid on him sickness:If his soul become an offering for guilt, He shall see a seed, He shall prolong his days,And the purpose of Yahweh, in his hand, shall prosper:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Of the travail of his soul, shall he see He shall be satisfied with his knowledge, A setting right when set right himself, shall my Servant win for the Many, Since of their iniquities, he, taketh the burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, will I give him a portion in the great, And the strong, shall he apportion as spoil, Because he poured out, to death his own soul, And with transgressors, let himself be numbered,Yea, he, the sin of Many, bare, And for transgressors, interposeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
