My Lord hath one who is, strong and bold, Like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, Like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, Hath he thrust it down to the earth with force:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>With the feet shall be trodden down, the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So shall his fading wreath of majestic beauty, Which is on the head of the fertile valley, becomeLike the first-ripe fig before fruit-harvest, Which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand, he swalloweth it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In that day, will Yahweh of hosts become A crown of beauty, and A diadem of majesty,Unto the remnant of his people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even a spirit of justiceto him that presideth over justice, And strength to them who would turn back the battle at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But as for these, With wine, do they reel, and With strong drink, do they stagger,Priest and prophet, reel with strong drink They are swallowed up through wine They stagger through strong drink, They reel in prophetic vision, They totter in pronouncing judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For, all tables, are full of filthy vomit,There is no place!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whom, would he teach knowledge? And, whom, would he cause to understand the message? Them who are weaned from the milk? taken from the breasts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it isPrecept upon precept, precept upon precept, Line upon line, line upon line,A little here a little there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, with a jabbering lip, and with an alien tongue, must he speak unto this people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom he saidThis, is the restgive ye rest to the weary, and This, is the quietness,But they were unwilling to hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the word of Yahweh must be to themPrecept upon precept, precept upon precept, Line upon line, line upon line, A little here, a little there,That they may go and fall backward and be torn and snared and captured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore, hear ye the word of Yahweh, Ye men who scoff,Ye rulers of this people that is in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because ye have saidWe have solemnised a covenant with death, And with hades, have we effected a vision,The overflowing scourge when it sweepeth by, shall not reach unto us, For we have made lying our refuge. And in falsehood, have we hid ourselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, Thus, saith My Lord, Yahweh, Behold me! founding in Zion a stone, A stone of testing, The costly corner of a well-laid foundation, he that trusteth, shall not make haste!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But I will makeJustice the line, and Righteousness the plummet,And the hail shall, sweep away, your refuge of lying, And your hiding-place, the waters shall overflow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So shall be wiped out your covenant with death, And your vision with hades, not stand,When the overflowing scourge, sweepeth past, then shall ye be thereby beaten down:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As often as it sweepeth past, it shall take you away, For morning by morning, shall it pass along. By day and by night,And it shall be nothing less than a terror to make out the message;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For too short is the couch to stretch oneself out,And, the coverlet, too narrow, when one draweth up his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as in Mount Perazim, will Yahweh, arise, As in the vale of Gibeon, will he be stirred,To do his workforeign is his work, And to perform his taskstrange is his task.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now, therefore do not show yourselves scoffers, Lest your fetters, be bound fast,For, of a full end, and that a decreed one, have I heard from My Lord, Yahweh of hosts upon all the land</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give ear, and hear ye my voice,Hearken, and hear ye my speech:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All day long, doth the plowman plow for sowing? Doth he continue laying open and harrowing his soil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Doth he not when he hath levelled the face thereof, Cast abroad the fennel? And, the cummin, doth he not scatter? And plant wheat in rows, And barley in a lot, And spelt in the border thereof?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yea One hath trained him to good judgment, His God, directeth him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For not with a sledge, must, black coriander be threshed, Nor must, the wheel of a cart, on cummin, be turned, But with a staff, must fennel be eaten, And cummin with a rod:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bread-corn, must be crushed,Yet would he not be evermore, threshing, it, So he hasteneth over it the wheel of his cart, with his horsemen, He crusheth it not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Even this, from Yahweh of hosts, cometh forth,Who hath bestowed distinction upon counsel, And magnified sound wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
