I, Yahweh,   First, And with them who are last, I, am the Same!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Coastlands have seen, so they fear, The ends of the earth, are in dread,They have drawn near, and have come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Every man, to his neighbour, giveth help,And to his brother, saith Take courage!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So, the carver, hath encouraged, the goldsmith, he that maketh smooth with the hammer, him that smiteth the anvil,Saying of the welding, It is, good, Then hath he fastened it with nailsit must not totter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, thou, Israel, my Servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,The seed of Abraham my loving one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, And from the extremities thereof, have called thee,And said to thee, My Servant, thou! I have chosen thee and not cast thee off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not fear, for with thee, I am! Look not around, for, I, am thy God,I have emboldened thee, Yea I have helped thee, Yea I have upheld thee with my righteous right-hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Lo! they shall turn pale and be ashamedAll they who have been incensed against thee,They shall become as nothing and perishThe men who have been thine accusers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou shalt seek them, but shalt not find themThe men who have contended with thee, They shall become as nothing, and as a thing of noughtThe men who have warred against thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I, Yahweh thy God am firmly grasping thy right-hand,Who am saying unto thee Do not fear!

Seeking water when there is none, Their tongue with thirst being parched IYahweh, will answer them, The God of Israel, I will not forsake them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will open, On bare hills rivers, and In the midst of plains, fountains,I will make The desert, a lake of water, and Parched land, springs of water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will set in the desert! Cedar, acacia, and myrtle, and oil-tree,I will place, in the waste plain, Cypress, holm-oak, and sherbin-cedar, together</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That men may see and observe and consider and understand at once, That, the hand of Yahweh, hath done this, That the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Bring near your contention, Saith Yahweh,Advance your defences, Saith the King of Jacob:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let them advance them, and tell us, What shall happen,Things known in advancewhat they were, tell ye, That we may lay them to our heart and mark the after-story of them, Or, things yet to come, let us hear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Tell ye the events which shall be here-after, That we may perceive that gods, ye are,Surely ye must do somethinggood or bad, That we may be amazed and behold it, at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Lo! ye, are, of nought, And your work is a puff of breath,An abomination, he that chooseth you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have roused up one from the North, and he hath come, From the rising of the sun, calleth he on my Name,And he hath come, on deputies, as though they were mortar, And as a potter treadeth clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Who hath told in advance, that we might know, And beforetime, that we might say Right!
