Jail of them, And, in houses of restraint, concealed,They have become a prey, and there is none to deliver,A booty, and there is none to sayRestore!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who among you, will give ear to this,Let him hearken and hear, for an aftertime?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave, as a booty, Jacob. And, Israel, to them who were ready to take prey? Was it not Yahweh I? He against whom we have sinned, And they were not willing, in his ways, to walk, Neither hearkened they to his instruction?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he hath poured out, upon him, the glow of his anger, and the strength of battle; And it hath set him aflame round about, yet he knoweth it not, And it hath kindled upon him yet he layeth it not to heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
