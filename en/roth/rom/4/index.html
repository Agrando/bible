And Abraham believed in God, and it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now, unto him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned by way of favour but by way of obligation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Whereas, unto him that worketh not but believeth on him that declareth righteous the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Just as David also affirmeth the happiness of the man unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Happy, they whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Happy, the man whose sin the Lord will in nowise reckon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This happiness, then,   for the circumcision, or for the uncircumcision? for we sayHis faith was reckoned unto Abraham as righteousness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How, then, was it reckoned? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, a sign, he received   of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while yet uncircumcised; to the end he might be father of all that believe during uncircumcision, to the end  the same  righteousness might be reckoned unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And father of circumcisionunto them who are not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, while yet uncircumcised, of our father Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, not through means of law, doth the promise belong unto Abraham or unto his seed,that he should be heir of thee world; but, through a righteousness by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, if they who are of law are heirs, made void is faith and of no effect is the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, the law, worketh out anger, but, where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this cause, it is by faith, in order that it may be by way of favour, so that the promise is firm unto all the seed,not unto that by the law only, but unto that also</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even as it is writtenFather of many nations, have I appointed thee: before him whom he believedGod, who causeth the dead to live, and calleth the things that are not as things that are:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who, past hope, upon hope believed, so that he became father of many nations,according to what had been saidSo shall be thy seed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, without becoming weak in his faith, he attentively considered his own body, already deadenedhe being a hundred years old, the deadening also of Sarahs womb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In respect, however, of the promise of God, he was not led to hesitate by unbelief, but received power by his faith, giving glory unto God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And being fully persuaded (that),what he hath promised, able is he also to perform:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore  also , it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was reckoned unto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But for our sakes alsounto whom it is to be reckoned,even unto them that believe upon him who raised Jesus our Lord from among the dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who was delivered up on account of our offences and was raised on account of the declaring us righteous.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
