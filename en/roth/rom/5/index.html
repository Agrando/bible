Because, the love of God, hath been poured out in our hearts, through the Holy Spirit that hath been given unto us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Seeing that, Christ, we being weak as yet, seasonably, in behalf of such as were ungodly, died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For, scarcely in behalf of a righteous man, will one die,in behalf of the good man indeed, peradventure one even dareth to die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But God commendeth his own love unto us in thatwe as yet being sinners, Christ in our behalf died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Much more, then, having now been declared righteous by his blood, shall we be saved through him from the anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, if being enemies we were reconciled unto God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, not only, so, but are even boasting in God, through our Lord Jesus  Christ ,through whom, now, the reconciliation we have received.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this cause,just as, through one man, sin into the world entered, and through sin, death,and, so, unto all men death passed through, for that all had sinned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, until law, sin was in the world, although sin is not reckoned when there is no law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet still, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression of Adam,who is a type of the Coming One;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, not as the fault, so,  also  the decree of favour, for, if, by the fault of the one, the many died, much more, the favour of God and the free-gift in favour, by the one man Jesus Christ, unto the many superabounded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, not as through one that sinned, is that which is freely given, for, the sentence of judgment, indeed, wasout of one   into condemnation, whereas, the decree of favour, isout of many faults, into a recovery of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, if, by the fault of the one, death reigned through the one, much more, they who the superabundance of the favour and of  the free-gift of  the righteousness do receive, in life, shall reign through the one, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hence then, as through one fault,   is unto all men for righteous acquittal unto life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, just as, through the disobedience of the one man, sinners, the many were constituted, so, also, through the obedience of the one, righteous, the many shall be constituted</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Law, however, gained admission, in order that the fault might abound, but, where the sin abounded, the favour greatly superabounded:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In order thatjust as sin reigned in death, so, also, favour, might reign through righteousness unto life age-abiding, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
