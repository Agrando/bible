Far be it! For, I also, am an Israelite,of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God hath not cast off his people, whom he fore approved. Or know ye not, in   Elijah what the scripture saith, when he intercedeth with God against Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lord! Thy prophets, have they slain, thine altars, have they overthrown, and, I, am left alone, and they are seeking my life!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what saith unto him the response? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who, indeed, have not bowed a knee unto Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus, then, in the present season also, a remnant, by way of an election of favour, hath come into being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If, however, by favour, no longer of works; else, favour, no longer proveth to be favour!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? That which Israel seeketh after, the same, it hath not obtained:the election, however, have obtained it, and, the rest, have been hardened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Even as it is writtenGod hath given unto them a spirit of stupor,eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,until this very day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, David, saithLet their table be turned into a snare, and into gin, and into a trap, and into a recompense unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Darkened be their eyes, not to see, and, their back, do thou continually bow down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say thenDid they stumble in order that they might fall? Far be it! But, by their fall, salvation   unto the nations, to the end of provoking them to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If, moreover, their fail, is the riches of a world, and their loss, the riches of nations, how much rather their fullness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Unto you, however, am I speaking,you of the nations; inasmuch, indeed, then, as, I, am an apostle to the nations, my ministry, I glorify,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If by any means I may provoke to jealousy my own flesh, and save some from among them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, if, the casting away of them, hath become the reconciling of a world, what shall, the taking of them in addition, be, but life from among the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If, moreover, the first fruit   also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If, however, some of the branches, have been broken out, and, thou, being a wild olive hast been grafted in among them, and hast become a joint partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Be not boasting over the branches! Howbeit, if thou boast, it is not, thou, that bearest the root, but the root, thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say, thenBranches were broken out in order that, I, might he grafted in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Well: by their want of faith, they have been broken out,and, thou, by thy faith, dost stand!Regard not lofty things, but be afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For, if, God, hath not spared, the natural branches, neither, thee, will he spare!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>See, then, the kindness and the severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity,but, upon thee, the kindness of God, if thou abide still in the kindness,otherwise, thou also, shalt he cut out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whereas, they also, unless they abide still in their want of faith, shall be grafted in, for God is, able, again to engraft them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, if, thou, out of the naturally wild olive was cut out, and, beyond nature, hast been engrafted into the good olive, how much rather, shall these, the natural   be engrafted into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I wish not, ye should be ignorant, brethren, of this sacred secret, lest within yourselves ye be presumptuous, that, a hardening in part, hath befallen Israel, until, the full measure of the nations, shall come in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, so, all Israel shall be saved: even as it is writtenThere shall have come out of Zion the Deliverer,He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, this, for them, is the covenant from me, as soon as I take away their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As touching the joyful-message, indeed, they are enemies for your sake, but, as touching the election, beloved for their fathers sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, not to be regretted, are the gifts and the calling of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For, just as, ye, at one time had not yielded unto God, and yet now have received mercy by their refusal to yield,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So, these also, have now refused to yield, by your own mercy, in order that, themselves also, should now become objects of mercy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God hath shut up all together, in a refusal to yield, in order that, upon all, he may bestow mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oh! the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments! and untraceable his ways!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who hath come to know the mind of the Lord? Or who hath become his counselor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Or who hath first given unto him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Because, of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things:unto him, be the glory, unto the ages. Amen!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
