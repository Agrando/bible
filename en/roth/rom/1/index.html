for it is Gods power unto salvation, to every one that believeth, both to Jew  first  and to Greek;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, a righteousness of God, is therein revealed,by faith unto faith: even as it is writtenBut, he that is righteous, by faith, shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For there is being revealed an anger of God from heavenagainst all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who, the truth, in unrighteousness, do hold down;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Inasmuch as, what may be known of God, is manifest among them, for, God, unto them, hath made it manifest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, the unseen things of him, from a worlds creation, by the things made, being perceived, are clearly seen, even his eternal power and divinity,to the end they should be without excuse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Inasmuch as, having come to know God, not, as God, did they glorify him, or give him thanks, but were made fruitless in their reasonings, and darkened was their undiscerning heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Professing to be wise, they were made foolish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God, for the likeness of an image of a corruptible man, and of birds and fourfooted beasts and reptiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore God gave them up in the covetings of their hearts unto impurity, so as to be dishonouring their bodies among them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who, indeed, exchanged away the truth of God for the falsehood, and rendered worship and service unto the creature rather than unto the Creator,who is blessed unto the ages. Amen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this cause, God gave them up unto dishonourable passions; for, even their females, exchanged away the natural use into that which is against nature,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In like manner also, even the males, leaving the natural use of the female, flamed out in their eager desire one for another, males with males, the indecency, effecting,and, the necessary recompence of their error, within themselves, duly receiving;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, even as they did not approve to be holding, God, in acknowledgment, God gave them up unto a disapproved mind to be doing the things that are not becoming,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, baseness, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil disposition,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Whisperers, detractors, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, vain boasters, inventors of vices, unto parents unyielding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Without discernment, regardless of covenants, without natural affection, unmerciful:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who, indeed, having acknowledged the righteous sentence of God,that, they who such things as these do practise, are worthy of death, not only, the same things, are doing, but are even delighting together with them who are practising</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
