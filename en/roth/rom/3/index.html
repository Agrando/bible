Or what, the profit of his circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Much, every way:First, indeed, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what? If some distrusted, shall their distrust make, the trust of God, void?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Far be it! But let, God, prove to be, true, albeit, every man, be false! Even as it is writtenThat thou mightest be declared righteous in thy words, and overcome when thou art in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But, if, our unrighteousness, commendeth, Gods righteousness, what shall we say? Surely, not unrighteous, is God who visiteth with his anger? After the manner of men, I am speaking,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Far be it! Else how shall God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, if, the truth of God, by my falsehood, hath the more abounded unto his glory, why, any longer, am, even I, as a sinner, to be judged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And why not, according as we are injuriously charged,  and  according as some affirm that we say, Let us do the bad things, that the good ones may come? whose sentence is, just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? do we screen ourselves? Not at all! For we have before accused both Jews and Greeks of being, all under sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even as it is writtenthere is none righteous, not even one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is none that discerneth, There is none that seeketh out God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All, have turned aside, together, have become useless, There is none that doeth kindness, not so much as one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A sepulchre opened, is their throat, with their tongues, have they used deceit, the poison of asps, is under their lips,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whose mouth, of cursing and bitterness, is full,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Swift, are their feet to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and misery, are in their ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, the way of peace, have they not known:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that, whatsoever things the law saith, to them who are within the law, it speaketh, in order that, every mouth, may be stopped and all the world come, under penal sentence, unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Inasmuch as, by works of law, shall no flesh be declared righteous before him,through law, in fact, is discovery of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now, apart from law, a righteousness of God hath been manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A righteousness of God, through faith in  Jesus  Christ, unto all that have faith; for there is no distinction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, all, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Being declared righteous freely by his favour through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom God hath set forth as a propitiatory covering, through faith in his blood, for a showing forth of his righteousness, by reason of the passing-by of the previously committed sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the forbearance of God,with a view to a showing forth of his righteousness in the present season, that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous him that hath faith in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where, then, the boasting! It is excluded. Through what kind of law? Of works? Nay! but through a law of faith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For we reckon that a man is to be declared righteous by faith, apart from works of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or,   the God, of Jews only, and not of the nations also? Yea! of the nations also:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If, at all events, God is one, who will declare righteousthe circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make, law, void through means of our faith? Far be it! On the contrary, law, we do establish!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
