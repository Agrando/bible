Oh Father!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit itself, beareth witness together with our spirit that we are children of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, if children, heirs alsoheirs, indeed, of God, but co-heirs with Christ,if, at least, we are suffering together, in order that we may also be glorified together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that unworthy are the sufferings of the present season to be compared with the glory about to be revealed towards us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, the eager outlook of creation, ardently awaiteth the revealing of the sons of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, unto vanity, hath creation been made subjectnot by choice, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That, creation itself also, shall be freedfrom the bondage of the decay into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that, all creation, is sighing together, and travailing-in-birth-throes together until the present,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, not only so, but, we ourselves, also, who have the first-fruit of the Spirit we  even ourselves, within our own selves do sigh,sonship ardently awaitingthe redeeming of our body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, by our hope, have we been saved,but, hope beheld, is not hope, for, what one beholdeth, why doth he hope for?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If, however, what we do not behold we hope for, with endurance, are we ardently awaiting</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the selfsame way moreover, even the Spirit, helpeth together in our weakness,for, what we should pray for as we ought, we know not, but, the Spirit itself, maketh intercession with sighings unutterable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is preferred by the Spiritthat, according to God, he maketh intercession in behalf of saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We know, further, that, unto them who love God, God causeth all things to work together for good,unto them who, according to purpose, are such as he hath called;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, whom he fore-approved, he also fore-appointed to be conformed unto the image of his Son, that he might be firstborn among many brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, whom he fore-appointed, the same, he also called, and, whom he called, the same, he also declared righteous, and, whom he declared righteous, the same, he also made glorious:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What, then, shall we say to a these things? If God   against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He, at least, who his own Son did not spare, but in behalf of us all delivered him up, how shall he not also, with him, all things upon us in favour bestow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall bring an accusation against the chosen ones of God? God, who declareth righteous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he that condemneth? Christ  Jesus  who died?Nay! rather was raised  from among the dead ,who is on the right hand of God, who also is making intercession in our behalf?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>According as it is writtenFor thy sake, are we being put to death all the day long, we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquering through him that hath loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded thatneither death nor life, nor messengers nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
