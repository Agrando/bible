so that I, from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Illyricum, have fulfilled the glad-message of the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Although, thus,as ambitious to be announcing the glad-messagenot where Christ had been named, lest, upon anothers foundation, I should be building;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, even as it is writtenThey shall see unto whom had been announced no tidings concerning him, and, they who had not heard, shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore, also, I have been hindered these many times from coming unto you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, now, no longer having place in these regions, and having had, a longing, to come unto you a good many years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As soon as I am journey to Spain,I am hoping, in fact, when journeying through to get sight of you, and by you to be set forward thither,if, with your company, I have first in some measure been satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, now, I am journeying unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Macedonia and Achaia have been well-pleased to make a certain fellowship for the destitute of the saints who are in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They have been well-pleased, indeed,and, their debtors, they are; for, if, with their spiritual things the nations have come into fellowship, they are bound also with their own carnal things to minister publicly unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This, then, having completed, and sealed unto them this fruit, I will come back by you unto Spain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And know that, when I come unto you, in the fullness of the blessing of Christ, I shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I beseech you, moreover,  brethren , through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers on my behalf unto God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In order that I may be delivered from them who do not yield in Judaea, and, my ministry which is unto Jerusalem, may prove to be acceptable unto the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In order that, with joy coming unto you through Gods will, I may together with you find rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now, the God of peace, be with you all.
