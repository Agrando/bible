Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It is not, however, as though the word of God had failed; for, not all they who are of Israel, the same are Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Neither, because they are seed of Abraham, are all children,but, In Isaac, shall there be called unto thee a seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That isnot the children of the flesh, the same are children of God; but, the children of the promise, are reckoned as a seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, of promise, is this wordAccording to this season, will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, not only so, but, when, Rebekah also, was with child, of oneIsaac our father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They, in fact, not being yet born, nor having practised anything good or bad,in order that the purpose of God by way of election might stand,not by works but by him that was calling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It was said unto herThe elder, shall serve the younger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Even as it is writtenJacob, have I loved, but, Esau, have I hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What, then, shall we say? Is there injustice with God? Far be it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, unto Moses, he saithI will have mercy upon whomsoever I can have mercy, and I will have compassion upon whomsoever I can have compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hence, then, it is nor of him that wisheth nor of him that runneth, but of the mercy-shewing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Scripture saith unto PharaohUnto this end, have I raised thee up, that I may thus shew in thee my power, and that I may declare my name in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hence, then,on whom he pleaseth, he hath mercy, and, whom he pleaseth, he doth harden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say to me, thenWhy longer findeth he fault? For, his purpose, who hath withstood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O man! Who, nevertheless, art, thou, that art answering again unto God? Shall the thing formed say unto him that formed itWhy didst thou make me thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or hath not the potter a right over the clayout of the same lump, to make some, indeed, into a vessel for honour, and some for dishonour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, if Godwishing to shew his anger and to make known his powerbare, in much patience, with vessels of anger already fitted for destruction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy which he prepared beforehand for glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whom he also called, even us, not only from among Jews, but also from among the nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As also in Hosea he saithI will call the not-my-people, My people, and the not-beloved, beloved,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall bein the place where it was said  to them not my people are, ye! there, shall they be calledSons of a Living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah, moreover, exclaimeth over IsraelThough the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant, shall be saved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For, a complete and concise account, will the Lord make upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, even as Isaiah hath before said,If, the Lord of hosts, had not left us a seed, as Sodom, had we become, and, as Gomorrha, had we been made like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What, then, shall we say? That, they of the nations, who were not in pursuit of righteousness, have laid hold of righteousness,a righteousness, however, which is by faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whereas, Israel, though in pursuit of a law of righteousness, unto a law, have not attained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Wherefore? Because, not by faith but as by works,   : they have stumbled at the stone of stumbling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Even as it is writtenLo! I lay in Zion, a stone to strike against and a rock to stumble over, and, he that resteth faith thereupon, shall not be put to shame.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
