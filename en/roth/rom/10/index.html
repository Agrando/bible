That is, to bring, Christ, down,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Or, Who shall descend into the abyss? That is, to bring up, Christ, from among the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what saith it? Near thee, is the declaration, In thy mouth and in thy heart,that is, the declaration of the faith, which we proclaim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That, if thou shalt confess the declaration with thy mouthThat Jesus is, Lord, and shalt believe with thy hearThat, God, raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, in heart, it is to be believed unto righteousness, and, by mouth, it is to be confessed unto salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the scripture saithNo one that resteth faith thereupon, shall be put to shame?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no distinctionof Jew or Greek,for, the same   , is Lord of all, being rich unto all who call upon him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How, then, shall men call upon one in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in one of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without one to proclaim?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how shall they proclaim, except they be sent? Even as it is writtenHow beautiful the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, not all, have become obedient unto the glad tidings;for, Isaiah, saithLord! who believed what we have heard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hence, our faith, cometh by something heard, and, that which is heard, through a declaration of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say: Have they not heard? Yea indeed,into all the earth, hath gone forth their sound, and, unto the ends of the inhabited world, their declarations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say: Hath, Israel, not come to know? First, Moses, saithI, will provoke you to jealousy on account of a no-nation, on account of an undiscerning nation, will I make you very angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Isaiah, however, waxeth daring, and saith,I have been found by them who after me were not seeking, manifest have I become unto them who for me were not enquiring;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whereas, regarding Israel, he saithAll day long, have I stretched forth my hands unto a people unyielding and contradicting.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
