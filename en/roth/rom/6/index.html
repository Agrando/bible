Shall we sin, because we are not under law but under favour? Far be it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know ye not that, unto whom ye are presenting yourselves as servants for obedience, servants ye are unto   whom ye are obedient, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thanks be unto God, thatwhereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient out of the heart unto the mould of teaching into which ye were delivered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, being freed from sin, ye were made servants unto righteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In human fashion am I speaking, because of the weakness of your flesh;for, just as ye presented your members as servants unto impurity and unto lawlessness  for lawlessness , so now, present ye your members as servants unto righteousness for sanctification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, when ye were servants of sin, ye were free as to righteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What fruit, therefore, had ye thenin things for which ye now are taking shame to yourselves? For, the end of those things, is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whereas, now, having been freed from sin, and made servants unto God, ye have your fruit for sanctification and, the end, life age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, the wages of sin, is death; but, Gods gift of favour, is life age-abiding, in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
