Is the law sin? Far be it! On the contrary, I had not discovered, sin, save through law, for even, of coveting, I had not been aware if, the law, had not kept on sayingThou shall not covet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Howbeit sin taking, occasionthrough the commandment, wrought out in me all manner of coveting; for, apart from law, sin is dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, I, was alive, apart from law, at one time, but, the commandment coming, sin sprang up to life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whereas, I, died,and the commandment which was unto life was found by me to be, itself, unto death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, sin,taking occasionthrough the commandment, completely deceived me and, through it, slew me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that, the law, indeed, is holy, and the commandment, holy, and righteous and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Did, then, that which is good, unto me become death? Far be it! But</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that, the law, is spiritual,I, however, am a creature of flesh, sold under sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, that which I am working out, I do not approve,for not, what I wish, the same I practise, but, what I hate, the same I do:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, if what I wish not the same I do, I consent unto the law that   right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, however, no longer am, I, working it out, but the, sin, that dwelleth in me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I know, in fact, that there dwelleth not in me, that is, in my flesh, anything good; for, the wishing, lieth near me, but, the working out of what is right, not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For not, the good that I wish, I do, but, the evil that I do not wish, the same I practise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, if what I wish not, the same, I do, no longer am, I, working it out, but the, sin, that dwelleth in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hence, I find the law, to me who wish to be doing the right, that, unto me, the wrong lieth near:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have, in fact, a sympathetic pleasure in the law of God; according to the inner man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I behold a diverse law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and taking me captive in the law of sin which existeth in my members:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wretched, man am, I! Who shall rescue me out of this body doomed to death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But  thanks be unto God!Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Hence, then,I myself, with the mind, indeed, am in servitude unto a law of God; but; with the flesh; unto a law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
