And she saidThy maid-servant hath, nothing at all, in the house, save a flask of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he saidGo, ask thee vessels, from without, of all thy neighbours,empty vessels, let them not be few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, when thou hast come in, then shalt thou shut the door behind thee and behind thy sons, and shalt pour out into all these vessels,and, that which is full, shalt thou set aside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So she went out from his presence, and shut the door behind her, and behind her sons,they bringing near to her, and she pouring out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her sonBring me a vessel more. And he said unto herThere is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then came she in, and told the man of God, and he saidGo, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor,and, thou and thy sons, shall live of the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And so it was, on a day, that Elisha passed over unto Shunem, where was a woman of position, and she constrained him to eat bread,and so it came about, whensoever he passed that way, that he turned aside thither, to eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said she unto her husband, Lo! I pray theeI perceive that, a holy man of God, he is,passing our way continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I pray thee, let us make a little upper chamber on the wall and set for him therea bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand,so shall it be, when he cometh to us, that he can turn in thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, on a day, that he came thither,so he turned aside into the upper chamber, and slept there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he unto Gehazi, his young man, Call this Shunammitess. And he called her, and she stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to himI pray thee, say unto herLo! thou hast cared for us with all this anxious care, what can be done for thee? Is it, that we should speak for thee, unto the king, or unto the general of the army? But she said, In the midst of mine own people, do, I, dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he said, What then can be done for thee? And Gehazi said, Verily, she hath no, son, and, her husband, is, old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he saidCall her. So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said heAt this season, about the time of spring, thou, shalt be embracing a son. And she saidNay! my lord, thou man of God, do not delude thy maid-servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the woman conceived, and bare a son, at this season, about the time of spring, when Elisha, had spoken unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, when the child was grown, it came to pass, on a certain day, that he went out unto his father, unto the reapers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he said unto his fatherMy head! my head! So he said unto the young man, Carry him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, when he had carried him, and brought him in unto his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God,and shut him in, and then went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she called unto her husband, and saidSend me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses,that I may run unto the man of God, and return!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he saidWherefore art thou going unto him, to-day, neither new moon nor sabbath? And she saidPeace!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then saddled she the ass, and said unto her young manLead on, and go forward,do not slacken, for my sake, the riding, except I have bidden thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So she went her way, and came unto the man of God, unto Mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her, opposite, that he said unto Gehazi young man, Lo! this Shunammitess!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now, run, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to herIs it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she said, Well!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, when she came unto the man of God, on the mount, she caught hold of his feet,and Gehazi drew near to thrust her away, when the man of God saidLet her alone! for, her life, is embittered to her, howbeit, Yahweh, hath hidden it from me, and hath not told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said she, Did I ask a son, of my lord? Said I not, Thou must not mislead me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to GehaziGird thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way, if thou meet with any man, thou must not bless him, and, if any man bless thee, thou must not respond to him,then shalt thou lay my staff upon the face of the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the mother of the boy said, By the life of Yahweh and by the life of thine own soul, I will not leave thee. So he arose and followed her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now, Gehazi, had passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the boy, but there was neither voice, nor attention,so he returned to meet him, and told him, sayingThe boy hath not awaked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, when Elisha had come into the house, lo! the boy, was dead, laid upon his bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So he went in, and shut the door upon them two,and prayed unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then gat he up, and lay upon the child, and put his own mouth upon his mouth, and his own eyes upon his eyes, and his own hands upon his hands, and bowed himself upon him,and the flesh of the child, waxed warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then retraced he, and walked in the houseonce to and fro, and then went up and bowed himself upon him,and the boy sneezed as many as seven times, and the boy opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then called he Gehazi, and saidCall this Shunammitess. So he called her, and, when she was come in unto him, he saidTake up thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So she came in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground,and took up her son, and went forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now, Elisha, returned to Gilgal, and there was, a famine, in the land, and, the sons of the prophets, being seated before him, he said to his young manPut on the large pot, and boil a mess of food, for the sons of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one went out into the field, to gather herbs, and found a vine in the field, and gathered thereof wild gourds, his lap full, and came in, and sliced them into the pot; for they knew them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they poured out for the men to eat,and it came so pass, as they were eating of the mess, that, they, made outcry and saidDeath in the pot, O man of God! And they could not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he saidThen fetch meal. And he cast it into the pot,and then saidPour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, a man, came in from Baal-Shalisha, and brought for the man of God firstfruit bread, twenty barley loaves, and garden grain in the husk thereof. And he saidGive to the people, that they may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But his attendant saidHow can I set this before a hundred men? And he saidGive to the people, that they may eat, for, Thus, saith Yahweh, They are about to eat and to leave remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he set before them, and they did eat and left remaining, according to the word of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
