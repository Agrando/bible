Then shalt thou open the door and flee, and not tarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the young man went his waythe young man the prophetunto Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, when he came up, lo! the captains of the force, sitting, and he saidA word, have I, for thee, O captain! And Jehu saidFor which, of us all? And he said,For thee, O captain!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then rose he up and went inside, and poured out the oil upon his head, and said unto himThus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel, I have anointed thee to be king unto the people of Yahweh, unto Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy lord,so will I avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>so shall perish all the house of Ahab,and I will cut off to Ahab the meanest, both him that is shut up and him that is left at large, in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yea I will deliver up the house of Ahab, like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat,and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, as for Jezebel, the dogs shall eat</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then, Jehu, came forth unto the servants of his lord, and one said to himIs all well? why came this madman unto thee? And he said unto them, Ye, know, the man and his message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they saidFalse! pray tell, us. And he said,Thus and thus, spake he unto me, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh, I have anointed thee to be king unto Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then hasted they, and took, every man his garment, and put it under him, upon the very steps,and blew with a horn, and said, Jehu, is king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus did Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspire against Joram,when, Joram, was watching Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jehoram the king had returned to get himself healed in Jezreel, of the wounds wherewith the Syrians had wounded him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. Then said JehuIf such is your mind, let no fugitive get forth out of the city, to go and tell it in Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went towards Jezreel, for, Joram, was lying there,and, Ahaziah king of Judah, had come down to see Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, the watchman, was standing upon the tower, in Jezreel, so he saw the great company of Jehu, when he came, and saidA great company, can I see! Then said JehoramTake a horseman and send to meet them, that he may sayIs it peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the horseman went to meet him, and saidThus, saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu saidWhat hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came up to them, but hath not turned back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then sent he a second horseman, and he came up to them and said, Thus, saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu saidWhat hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the watchman told, saying, He came up to them, but hath not turned back,and, the driving, is like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi; for, with mad haste, doth he drive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jehoram, Harness! So one harnessed his chariot,and Jehoram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went forth, each man in his chariot, yea they went forth to meet Jehu, and came upon him in the heritage of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, when Jehoram saw Jehu, that he saidIs it peace, Jehu? And he saidWhat can be the peace, while thy mother Jezebels harlotries and her incantations do so abound?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jehoram turned his hands, and fled,and said unto AhaziahTreachery! O Ahaziah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, Jehu, bent his bow, and smote Jehoram, between his arms,and the arrow came out at his heart,and he sank down in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said he unto Bidkar his officer, Take   cast him forth, into the field-portion of Naboth the Jezreelite,for remember, when I and thou were riding as a couple together after Ahab his father, that, Yahweh, laid upon him this doom:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Surely, the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, have I lately seen, declareth Yahweh, therefore will I requite thee in this portion, declareth Yahweh. Now, therefore, take   cast him forth into the portion, according to the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, Ahaziah king of Judah, saw it, and fled by the way of the garden house,and Jehu pursued him, and saidHim also! smite him in the chariot! It was in the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Mepidgo, and died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And his servants conveyed him in a chariot and brought him into Jerusalem,and buried him in his sepulchre, with his fathers, in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now it was, in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, that Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now, when Jehu entered Jezreel and, Jezebel, heard of it, she set her eyes in stibium, and ornamented her head, and looked forth through the lattice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So, when, Jehu, had entered in at the gate, she said, Was it peace, when Zimri slew his lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he lifted up his face unto the lattice, and saidWho, is with me? Who? And there looked out unto him, two or three eunuchs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he saidHurl her down. And they hurled her down,and there was sprinkled of her bloodupon the wall, and upon the horses, and they trode upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, when he had entered and eaten and drunk, he saidLook, I pray you, after this accursed woman, and bury her, for the daughter of a king, she is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they went to bury her,but found not of hersave the skull, and the feet, and the palms of the hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then came they back, and told him, and he saidThe word of Yahweh, it is, which he spake by the hand of his servant, Elijah the Tishbite, sayingIn the town-land of Jezreel, shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So shall the carcass of Jezebel become like heaps of dung on the face of the field, in the town-land of Jezreel: So that they cannot say, This, is Jezebel!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
