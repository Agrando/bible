And Elisha said, By the life of Yahweh and by the life of thine own soul, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came forth unto Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that, to-day, Yahweh is taking away thy lord, from thy head? And he saidI also, know, be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Elijah said to himElisha, I pray thee, tarry here, for, Yahweh, hath sent me to Jericho. And he saidBy the life of Yahweh and by the life of thine own soul, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then drew near the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho, unto Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that, to-day, Yahweh is taking away thy lord from thy head? And he saidI also, know; be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elijah said to himTarry here, I pray thee, for, Yahweh, hath sent me to the Jordan. And he saidBy the life of Yahweh and by the life of thine own soul, I will not leave thee. So they two, went on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, fifty men of the sons of the prophets, came, and stood over against them, afar off,and, they two, stood by the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided, hither and thither,so that they two, passed over, on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass, as they went over, that, Elijah, said unto ElishaAsk, what I shall do for thee, ere yet I be taken from thee. And Elisha said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double portion of thy spirit upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saidThou hast asked a hard thing,if thou see me when taken from thee, thou shall have it, so, but, if not, thou shalt not have it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as they were going on and on and talking, that lo! there was a chariot of fire, with horses of fire, which parted, those two, asunder,and Elijah went up in a storm, into the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, as soon as Elisha saw it, he, began crying outMy father! my father! The chariots of Israel, and the horsemen thereof! But, when he could see him no longer, he took hold of his clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then took he up the mantle of Elijah, which had fallen from him,and returned and stood, on the brink of the Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and took the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah? And, when, he also, smote the waters, they were divided, hither and thither, and Elisha, passed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, when the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho, over against him, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah, resteth, on Elisha. So they came to meet him, and bowed themselves down to him, to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said they unto himLo! we pray thee, there are with thy servants fifty men, sons of valourlet them go, we pray thee, and seek thy lord, lest the Spirit of Yahweh have borne him away, and cast him on one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys. And he saidYe shall not send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, when they urged him until he was ashamed, he saidSend. So they sent fifty men, and made search three days, but found him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, when they came back unto him, he, having tarried at Jericho, he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Do not go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Lo! we pray thee, the situation of the city, is good, as, my lord, seeth,but, the waters, are bad, and, the land, apt to miscarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he saidBring me a new bowl, and put therein, salt. So they brought it unto him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast therein, saith,and saidThus, saith Yahweh, I have healed these waters; there shall come from thence, no longer, death or aptness to miscarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the waters were healed,   unto this day,according to the word of Elisha which he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from thence, to Bethel,and, as he was going up on the way, some lads, came forth, out of the city, and made mockery of him, and said to him, Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, when he turned round and saw them, he cursed them, in the name of Yahweh,and there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare, of them, forty-two youths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went from thence, unto Mount Carmel,and, from thence, he returned, to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
