So he went, and took in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he brought in the letter unto the king of Israel, saying, Now, therefore, when this letter cometh in unto thee, lo! I have sent unto thee, Naaman my servant, and thou shalt set him free from his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am, I, God, to kill and to make alive, that, this, man is sending unto me, to set one free from his leprosy,but, of a truth, just mark, I pray you, and see, that he, is seeking an occasion, against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent unto the king, sayingWherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come, I pray thee, unto me, that he may get to know that there is a prophet in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Naaman came, with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the entrance of the house of Elisha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying,Go and bathe seven times in the Jordan, so shall thy flesh come back to thee, and be thou clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Naaman was wroth, and went away,and saidLo! I thought, Unto me, will he, come right out, and take his stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand towards the spot, and so set free the leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are not, Abanah and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not bathe, in them, and be clean? So he turned, and went away in a rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then drew near his servants, and spake unto him, and saidMy father! if, some great thing, the prophet had commanded thee, wouldst thou not have done it? then, how much rather, when he hath said unto thee, Bathe and be clean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then went he down, and dipped himself in the Jordan, seven times, according to the word of the man of God: and his flesh came back, as the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he returned unto the man of God, he and all his company; and came, and took his stand before him, and saidLo! I pray theeI know that there is no God in all the earth, save in Israel,now, therefore, I pray thee, accept a blessing from thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he saidBy the life of Yahweh, before whom I stand, I will not accept one. And, though he urged him to accept it, yet did he refuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Naaman, Shall there not, then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant, two mules burden of earth? For thy servant will henceforth offer neither ascending-offering nor sacrifice to other gods, save only to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In this thing, Yahweh grant forgiveness to thy servant,When my lord entereth the house of Rimmon, to bow down therein, he leaning upon my hand, and so I bow down in the house of Rimmon, when he boweth down in the house of Rimmon, Yahweh, I pray, grant forgiveness to thy servant, in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto himGo and prosper! But, when he had gone from him some distance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, saidLo! my lord, hath restrained, this Naaman the Syrian, by not taking at his hand that which he brought! By the life of Yahweh, verily, I will runs after him, and accept of him, something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Gehazi hastened after Naaman. And, when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from his chariot to meet him, and said,Is all well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, All is well. My lord, hath sent me to say, Lo! just now, have come unto me, two young men out of the hill country of Ephraim, of the sons of the prophets,give for them, I pray thee, a talent, of silver, and two changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Naaman said, Be content, accept two talents. So he urged him, and bound up two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his young men, and they bare them before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, when he came to the hill-tower, he took them from their hand, and put them in charge within,and let the men go, and they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, when, he, came in and stood before his lord, Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said,Thy servant hath been neither hither nor thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he said unto himMy heart, had not gone with thee, when someone turned again from off his chariot, to meet thee! Is it a time to accept silver, or to accept raiment, or oliveyards, or vineyards, or flocks or herds, or men-servants, or maid-servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The leprosy of Naaman, therefore, shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed, to times age-abiding. And he went forth from before hima leperlike snow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
