So the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah, three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah delivered up all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasuries of the house of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time, Hezekiah cut off the doors of the temple of Yahweh, and the columns, which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid,and gave them unto the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rab-shakeh, from Lachish unto King Hezekiah, with a heavy force to Jerusalem,so they came up and drew near to Jerusalem, and took their stand by the upper channel of the pool, which is in the highway of the fullers field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then called they for the king, and there went out unto them Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,and Shebnah, the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Rab-shakeh said unto themPray you, say unto Hezekiah,Thus, saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What trust is this wherewith thou dost trust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou hast saidthey are only words of the lips!Counsel and might   for the war. Now, in whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, lo! thou dost trust thyself on the support of this bruised cane, on Egypt, whereon, if a man lean, it will enter his hand and lay it open,so, is Pharaoh king of Egypt, to all who trust upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But, if ye should say unto me, In Yahweh our God, do we trust, Then is that not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath removed, and said unto Judah, and unto JerusalemBefore this altar, shall ye bow down, in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, therefore, pledge thyself, I pray thee, with my lord, the king of Assyria,that I supply thee with two thousand horses, if thou, on thy part, be able to set riders upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>How then wilt thou turn back the face of one pasha of the least of my lords servants? Or hast thou, on thy part, trusted to Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, is it, without Yahweh, that I have come up against this place, to destroy it? Yahweh himself, said unto me, Go thou up against this land, and destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then said Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh: Speak, we pray thee, unto thy servants in the, Syrian, language, for, we, can, understand, it,and do not speak with us in, the Jews, language, in the ears of the people who are upon the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Rab-shakeh said unto themIs it, concerning thy lord, and concerning thee, that my lord hath sent me to speak these things? Is it not concerning the men who are tarrying upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own water with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So then Rab-shakeh took his stand, and cried out with a loud voice, in, the Jews, language,and spake, and said, Hear ye the message of the great king, the king of Assyria:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus, saith the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not he able to deliver you out of his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Neither let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh, will, certainly deliver, us,this city, therefore, shall not be given over into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do not hearken unto Hezekiah,for, thus, saith the king of Assyria, Deal with me thankfully, and come out unto me, then shall ye eatevery one of his own vine, and every one of his own fig-tree, and drink every one the waters of his own cistern;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Until I come and take you, into a land like your own landA land of corn and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and honey, so shall ye live, and not die,But do not hearken unto Hezekiah, for he would persuade you, saying, Yahweh, will deliver us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Have, the gods of the nations, at all delivered, any one of them, his country, out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Where are the gods of Hamath, and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Yea, did they deliver Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who are they, among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country, out of my hand,that, Yahweh, should deliver, Jerusalem, out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word,for, the command of the king, it was, sayingYe must not answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then came in Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, unto Hezekiah, with rent clothes,and they told him the words of Rab-shakeh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
