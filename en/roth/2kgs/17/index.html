twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, began Hosea son of Elah to reign in Samaria, over Israel,   nine years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did the thing that was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh,only, not like the kings of Israel who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Against him, came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria,and Hoshea became his servant, and rendered him a present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then found the king of Assyria, in Hosea, a conspiracy, in that he had sent messengers unto So king of Egypt, and had not brought up a present to the king of Assyria, as   year by year,therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land,yea he came up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the ninth year of Hoshea, did the king of Assyria capture Samaria, and carried Israel away captive to Assyria,and settled them in Halah, and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and the mountains of Media.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus it came to pass that Israel sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt,yea they did reverence to other gods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh had dispossessed from before the sons of Israel,and   of the kings of Israel, which they had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Israel did, secretly, things which were not right, against Yahweh their God,and built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the watchmens tower, to the fortified city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they set up for themselves pillars and Sacred Stems, upon every high hill, and under every green tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and burned incense there, in all the high places, like the nations whom Yahweh drave out from before them,and did things that were wicked, so as to provoke Yahweh to anger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they served the manufactured gods, as to which Yahweh had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh testified against Israel and against Judah, through all his prophetsevery one who had a vision, sayingTurn ye from your wicked ways, and keep my commandments, my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers; and which I sent unto you through my servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Howbeit they hearkened not,but stiffened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who trusted not in Yahweh their God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but rejected his statutes, and his covenant, which he solemnised with their fathers, and his testimonies wherewith he testified against them,and followed vanity, and became vain, and followed the nations that were round about them, as to whom Yahweh charged them, so that they should not do like them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made for themselves something moltentwo calves, and made a Sacred Stem, and bowed themselves down to all the army of the heavens, and served Baal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, and used divinations and enchantments, and sold themselves to do the thing that was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh, provoking him to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Yahweh shewed himself exceeding angry with Israel, and removed them from his presence,there was none left, save the tribe of Judah, alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Even Judah, kept not the commandments of Yahweh their God,but walked in the statutes of Israel, which they had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and humiliated them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers,until he had cast them out from his presence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for he rent Israel away from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam son of Nebat, king,and Jeroboam thrust away Israel from following Yahweh, and caused them to commit a great sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he had committed,they turned not away therefrom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>until that Yahweh removed Israel from his presence, according as he spake through all his servants the prophets,and so Israel was driven away from off their own soil, to Assyria, until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king of Assyria brought   Sepharvaim, and caused them to dwell in the cities of Samaria, instead of the sons of Israel,so they took possession of Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And so it was, that, when they first dwelt there, they revered not Yahweh,therefore Yahweh sent among them, lions, which were slaying them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore spake they unto the king of Assyria, saying, The nations whom thou hast removed and settled in the cities of Samaria, know not the custom of the God of the land,and he hath sent among them lions, and lo! they are slaying them, because they know not the custom of the God of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the king of Assyria commanded, sayingCarry thither, one of the priests, whom ye brought away captive from thence, that they may go, and dwell there,and teach them the custom of the God of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then came one of the priests whom they had carried away captive from Samaria, and dwelt in Bethel,and he began teaching them how they should do reverence unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Howbeit the nations severally were making their own gods,and did put them in the houses of the high places, which, the Samaritans, had made, each several nation, in their cities wherein, they, were dwelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So then, the men of Babylon, made Succoth-benoth, and, the men of Cuth, made Nergal, and, the men of Hamath, made Ashima:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and, the Avvites, made Nibhaz and Tartak, and, the Sepharvites, did consume their sons in the fire, to Adrammelech and Anammelech gods of Sepharvaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus became they reverers of Yahweh,and yet made for themselves, from the whole compass of them, priests of high places, who became offerers for them in the house of the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Yahweh, were they revering,and yet, their own gods, were they serving, according to the custom of the nations from whence they had brought them away captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Unto this day, are they offering according to the former customs,they are not revering Yahweh, neither are they offering after their own statutes, or their own custom, nor yet after the law and the commandment which Yahweh commanded the sons of Jacob, whose name he made to be Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>With, whom, Yahweh solemnised a covenant, and commanded them sayingYe shall not revere other gods,nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But, Yahwehwho brought you up out of the land of Egypt, with great might, and with arm outstretched, him, shall ye revere,and to him, shall ye bow down, and to him, shall ye sacrifice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, the statutes and the regulations, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, shall ye surely observe to do, continually,So shall ye not revere other gods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But, the covenant which I have solemnised with you, shall ye not forget,So shall ye not revere other gods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But, Yahweh your God, shall ye revere,then will, he, deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Howbeit they hearkened not,but, according to their own former custom, were they offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thus were these nations doing reverence unto Yahweh, and yet, unto their own carved images, were they rendering service,yea, their sons and their sons sons, as the fathers offered, so are, they, offering until this day.</span>
