he hath come forth to fight with thee,then he again sent messengers unto Hezekiah, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus, shall ye, speak, unto Hezekiah king of Judah, sayingLet not thy God in whom thou art trusting beguile thee, saying,Jerusalem shall not be given over, into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Lo! thou thyself, hast heard, what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, in devoting them to destruction,and shalt, thou, be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Did the gods of the nations, deliver them, whom my fathers destroyed, Gozan, and Haran,and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who were in Telassar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where are the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim,of Hena, and Ivvah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, when Hezekiah had received the letter at the hand of the messengers, and had read it, then went he up to the house of Yahweh, and Hezekiah spread it out before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, O Yahweh, God of Israel, inhabiting the cherubim, thou thyself, art GOD, alone, for all the kingdoms of the earth,thou, didst make the heavens and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Bow down, O Yahweh, thine ear, and hear, Open, O Yahweh, thine eyes, and see,yea hear thou the words of Sennacherib, who hath sentTo reproach a Living God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Of a truth, O Yahweh,the kings of Assyria have devoted to destruction the nations and their lands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and have put their gods in the fire,for, no-gods, were, they, but the work of the hands of menwood and stone, and so they destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, therefore, O Yahweh our God, save us we pray thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know, that, thou, Yahweh, art God, alone!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying,Thus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel, What thou hast prayed unto me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This, is the word that Yahweh hath spoken concerning him,The virgin daughter of Zion, laugheth thee to scorn, mocketh thee, The daughter of Jerusalem, after thee, doth wag her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whom, hast thou reproached, and insulted? and, against whom, hast thou lifted high thy voice? yea thou hast proudly raised thine eyes, against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Through thy messengers, thou hast reproached My Lord, and hast saidWith my multitude of chariots, have I ascended the height of the mountains, the recesses of Lebanon,and have cut down its tallest cedars, its choicest firs, and have entered the shelter of its summit, its thick garden forests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I, have digged, and have drunk foreign waters,and have dried up, with the soles of my feet, all the streams of besieged places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hast thou not heardthat, long ago, that, is what I appointed, and, from days of old, devised it? Now, have I brought it to pass, that thou mightest serve to lay waste, in desolate ruins, fortified cities;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, their inhabitants, being powerless, were overthrown and put to shame,they became grass of the field, and young herbage, grass on housetops, and seed withered before it came up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Howbeit, thine abode, and thy coming out and thy going in, I know,and thy raging against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because, thy raging against me, and thy contempt, have come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my ring in thy nose, and my bit in thy lips, and will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, this unto thee, is the signEating, this year, the growth of scattered seeds, and, in the second year, that which groweth after,then, in the third year, sow ye and reap, plant ye vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then shall the escaped of the house of Judah that remain, againtake root downward, and bear fruit upward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For, out of Jerusalem, shall go forth a remnant, and that which hath escapedout of Mount Zion,the jealousy of Yahweh of hosts, will perform this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>ThereforeThus, saith Yahweh, concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not enter this city, nor shoot there, an arrow,nor attack it with shield, nor cast up against it, a mound;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>By the way that he cometh in, by the same, shall he return,and, into this city, shall he not enter, declareth Yahweh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Thus will I throw a covering over this city, to save it,for mine own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, during that night, that the messenger of Yahweh went forth, and smote, in the camp of the Assyrians, a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And, when men arose early in the morning, lo! they were all, dead bodies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria brake up, and went his way, and returned,and remained in Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, as he was bowing down in the house of Nisroch his god, that, Adrammelech and Sharezer</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
