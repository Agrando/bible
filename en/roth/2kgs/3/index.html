And he saidI will go up, I am as thou art, my people are as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he saidWhich way, then, shall we go up? And he saidThe way of the wilderness of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then departed the king of Israel, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom, and went round, a journey of seven days,and there was no water for the host, nor for the cattle that went with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said the king of IsraelAlas! for Yahweh hath called these three kings, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jehoshaphat saidIs there not, here, a prophet of Yahweh, that we may enquire of Yahweh, from him? Then answered one of the servants of the king of Israel, and said, Here, is Elisha son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said Jehoshaphat, The word of Yahweh, is with him. So the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom, went down unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elisha said unto the king of IsraelWhat have I and thou in common? get thee unto the prophets of thy father, and unto the prophets of thy mother. But the king of Israel said to himNay! for Yahweh hath called together these three kings, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said ElishaBy the life of Yahweh of hosts, before whom I stand, were it not that, the countenance of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would lift up, I would neither look at thee, nor see thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, now, bring me one that can touch the strings. For it used to be, when the player touched the strings, then would, the hand of Yahweh, be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said he, Thus, saith Yahweh, Make, in this torrent-bed, pits, pits!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, thus, saith YahwehYe shall not see wind, and ye shall not see rain, yet, that torrent-bed, shall be filled with water,And ye shall drink, ye, and your cattle, and your beasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, this being a small thing in the eyes of Yahweh, he will deliver Moab into your hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ye shall smite every strong city, and every choice city, and, every goodly tree, shall ye fell, and, all fountains water, shall ye close up,and, every goodly heritage, shall ye mar with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, in the morning, when the offering ascended, that lo! waters, were coming in from the way of Edom,and the land was filled with the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, all Moab, had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them,so they came together, from all who could gird on a girdle and upwards, and took their stand at the border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, when they rose early in the morning, the sun, shone forth upon the waters,and so the Moabites beheld over against them, the waters, red as blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They said thereforeBlood,this! Destroyed! The kings have destroyed each other! Yea they have smitten every man his neighbour,Now, then, to the spoil, O Moab!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, when they came into the camp of Israel, Israel arose and smote Moab, and they fled from before them,so they entered thereinto, yea still farther entered Moab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, the cities, they pulled down, and, on every goodly heritage, they cast every man his stone, and filled it, and, all fountains of waters, they closed up, and, every goodly tree, they felled, and, though they left the stones thereof in Kir-haraseth, yet the slingers surrounded and smote it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, when the king of Moab saw that, the battle, prevailed against him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through against the king of Edom, but they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he took his firstborn son who was to have reigned in his stead, and offered him up as an ascending-sacrifice upon the wall. And so it came to pass that there was great indignation against Israel. And they brake up from against him, and returned to their own land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
