Incurable is my diseasenot for any transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What man is like Job? He drinketh in scoffing like water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And is on the way to keep company, with the workers of iniquity, and to walk with lawless men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he hath said, It profiteth not a man, when, his good pleasure, is with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Wherefore, ye men of mind, hearken unto me,Far be it, that, GOD, should be lawless, or, the Almighty, be perverse!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, what any son of earth doeth, he repayeth him, and, according to every mans course, he causeth him to find.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Nay, verily, GOD, will not condemn unjustly,nor, the Almighty, pervert justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who set him in charge of the earth? Or who appointed   the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he should set against him his heart, His spirit and his inspiration, unto himself he should withdraw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All flesh together, would cease to breathe, and, the earth-born, unto dust, would return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If then   understanding, hear this, Give thou ear to the teaching of my words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall, the very hater of right, control? Or, the justthe mighty one, wilt thou condemn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Doth one say to a king, Abandoned one! Or, Lawless one! unto nobles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he hath shewn no respect of persons unto princes, neither hath he recognised the rich rather than the poor? For, the work of his hands, are they all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment, they die, even in the middle of the night,A people are convulsed when they pass away, A mighty one is removed, without hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For, his eyes, are on the ways of a man, and, all his footsteps, he beholdeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No darkness, and no death-shade, where the workers of iniquity may hide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, unto no man, doth he appoint a repetition,in going unto GOD in judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He shattereth mighty ones unsearchably, and setteth up others in their stead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, he observeth their works,and overturneth   in a night, and they are crushed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the place of lawless men, hath he chastised them, in presence of beholders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Forasmuch, as they turned from following him, and, none of his ways, did they teach;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Causing to reach him the outcry of the poor, Yea, the outcry of the oppressed, he heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When, he, giveth quiet, who then shall condemn? And, when he hideth   face, who then shall sing of him? whether unto a nation or unto mankind altogether,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That impious men may not reign, nor be ensnarers of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For, unto GOD, hath one   saidI have borne punishment, I will not be perverse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What I see not, do, thou, shew me, If, perverseness, I have wrought, I will do it no more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>According to thy mind, must he requite it, that thou hast refused?
