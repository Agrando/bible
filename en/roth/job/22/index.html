Surely a discreet man befriendeth himself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it a pleasure to the Almighty, that thou shouldst be righteous? or any profit, that thou shouldst be blameless in thy ways?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Is it, for thy reverence, that he will accuse thee? will enter with thee into judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not, thy wickedness, great? and, without end,   thine iniquities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Surely then hast been wont to put thy brother in pledge, for nothing, and, the garments of the ill-clad, hast thou stripped off:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>No waterto the weary, hast thou given to drink, and, from the hungry, thou hast withheld broad:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A man of might, to him, pertaineth the land, and, the favorite, dwelleth therein:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Widows, thou hast sent away empty, and, the arms of the fatherless, thou dost crush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this cause, round about thee, are snares, and a dread startleth thee suddenly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Or darknessthou canst not see, and, a flood of waters, covereth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not, GOD,   the height of the heavens? Behold, then, the head of the stars, that they are high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Wilt thou say then, What doth GOD know? Out through a thick cloud, can he judge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Dark clouds, are a veil to him, and he cannot see, or, the vault of the heavens, doth he walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The path of the ancient time, wilt thou mark, which the men of iniquity trod?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were snatched away before the time, and, a stream, washed away their foundation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who had been saying unto GOD, Depart from us! andWhat can the Almighty do for himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet, he, had filled their houses with good! The counsel of the lawless, then, is far from me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The righteous shall see and rejoice, and, the innocent, shall laugh them to scorn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If our assailants do not vanish, then, their abundance, a fire consumeth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Shew thyself to be one with himI pray theeand prosper, thereby, shall there come on thee blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Accept, I beseech thee, from his mouthinstruction,and lay up his sayings in thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou return unto the Almighty and submit thyself, if thou far remove perversity from thy tent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then lay up, in the dust, precious ore, and, among the stones of the torrent-beds, fine gold:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So shall, the Almighty, become, thy precious ores, yea glittering silver unto thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For, then, in the Almighty, shalt thou take exquisite delight, and shalt lift upunto GODthy face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thou shalt make entreaty unto him, and he will hear thee, and, thy vows, shalt thou pay;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And thou shalt decree a purpose, and it shall be fulfilled unto thee, and, upon thy ways, shall have shone a light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When men cast themselves down, then thou shalt say: Up! And, him that is of downcast eyes, shall he save;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He shall deliver the innocent, and thou shalt escape by the pureness of thy hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
