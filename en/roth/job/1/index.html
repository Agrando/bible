Thus and thus, was Job wont to do all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there came a certain day, when the sons of God entered in to present themselves unto Yahweh,so the accuser also entered, in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Whence comest thou? And the accuser answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and wandering about therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Hast thou applied thy heart unto my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, one revering God and avoiding evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the accuser answered Yahweh, and said, Is it, for nought, that Job revereth God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hast not, thou thyself, made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? The work of his hands, thou hast blessed, and, his substance, hath broken forth in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, in very deed, put forth, I pray thee, thy hand, and smite all that he hath,verily, unto thy face, will he curse thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Lo! all that he hath, is in thy hand, only, against himself, do not put forth thy hand. So the accuser went forth from the presence of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came a certain day,when his sons and his daughters were eating, and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, a messenger, came in unto Job, and said,The oxen, were plowing, and, the asses, feeding beside them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>when the Sabeans swooped down, and took them, and, the young men, smote they with the edge of the sword,and escaped am, only I alone, too tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yet was this one speaking, when, another, came in and said,A fire of God, fell out of the heavens, and burned up the sheep and the young men, and consumed them; and escaped am, only I alone, to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet was this one speaking, when, another, came in and said, The Chaldeans, appointed three chiefs, and spread out against the camels, and took them, and, the young men, smote they with the edge of the sword; and escaped am, only I alone, to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet was this one speaking, when, another, came in and said,Thy sons and thy daughters, were eating, and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>when lo! a great wind, came from over the desert, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they died,and escaped am, only I alone, to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell to the earth and worshipped;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and saidNaked came I forth from the womb of my mother, and naked must I return thither, Yahweh, gave, and, Yahweh, hath taken away,The name of Yahweh be blessed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this, Job sinned not, nor imputed folly unto God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
