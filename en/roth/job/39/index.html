The bringing forth of the hinds, canst thou observe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Canst thou count the months they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they give birth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They kneel down, their young, they bring forth; their pains, they throw off;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their young become strong, they grow up in the open field, they go out, and return not unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who hath sent forth the Wild Ass free? And, the bands of the swift-runner, who hath loosed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whose house I have made the waste plain, and his dwellings, the land of salt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He laugheth at the throng of the city, The shoutings of the driver, he heareth not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He espieth the mountains, his pasture-ground, and, after every green thing, maketh search.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will the Wild-Ox be pleased to be thy servant? or lodge for the night by thy crib?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Canst thou bind the wild-ox, so thatwith the ridgeshall run his cord? Or will he harrow the furrows after thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wilt thou trust in him, because of the greatness of his strength? Wilt thou leave unto him thy toil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wilt thou put faith in him, that he will bring back thy seed? and that, corn for thy threshing-floor, he will gather?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The wing of the Ostrich that waveth itself joyfully, Is it the pinion of lovingkindness or the plumage?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For she leavethto the earthher eggs, and, on the dust, she letteth them be warmed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And hath forgotten, that, a foot, may crush them,or, the wild beast, tread on them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Dealing hardly with her young, as none-of hers, In vain, her labour, without dread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For GOD hath suffered her to forget wisdom, and given her no share in understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What time, on high, she vibrateth her wings, she laugheth at the horse and his rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Couldst thou giveto the Horsestrength? Couldst thou clothe his neck with the quivering mane?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Couldst thou cause him to leap like a locust? The majesty of his snort, is a terror!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He diggeth into the plain, and rejoiceth in vigour, he goeth forth to meet armour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He laugheth at dread, and is not dismayed, neither turneth he back, from the face of the sword;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Against him, whiz   the quiver, the flashing head of spear and javelin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>With stamping and rage, he drinketh up the ground,he will not stand still when the horn soundeth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As oft as the horn soundeth, he saith, Aha! And, from afar, he scenteth the battle,the thunder of commanders and the war-cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Is it, by thine understanding, that the Bird of Passage betaketh him to his pinions? spreadeth out his wings to the south?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Or, at thy bidding, that the Eagle mounteth, and that he setteth on high his nest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The crag, he inhabiteth, and so lodgeth himself, on the tooth of the crag, and high fort;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From thence, he searcheth out food, far away, his eyes do pierce;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, his young brood, suck up blood, and, where the slain are, there, is he.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
