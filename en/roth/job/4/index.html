But, to restrain speech, who, can endure?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lo! thou hast admonished many, and, slack hands, hast thou been wont to uphold:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Him that was stumbling, have thy words raised up, and, sinking knees, hast thou strengthened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But, now, it cometh upon thee, and thou despairest, It smiteth even thee, and thou art dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not, thy reverence, thy confidence? And is not, thy hope, the very integrity of thy ways?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, I pray thee, who, being innocent, hath perished, or when, the upright, have been cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So far as I have seen, They who plow for iniquity and sow misery, reap the same:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By the blast of GOD, they perish, And, by the breath of his nostrils, are they consumed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the roaring of the lion, and the noise of the howling lion, yet, the teeth of the fierce lions, are broken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The strong lion perishing for lack of prey, Even the whelps of the lioness, are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, unto me, something was brought by stealth,and mine ear caught a whispering of the same:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When there were thoughts, from visions of the night,When deep sleep falleth upon men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Dread, came upon me, and trembling, The multitude of my bones, it put in dread:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then, a spirit, over my face, floated along, The hair of my flesh bristled-up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It stood still, but I could not distinguish its appearance, I looked, but there was no form before mine eyes,A whispering voice, I heard:-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall, mortal man, be more just than GOD? Or a man be more pure than, his Maker?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lo! in his own servants, he trusteth not, and, his own messengers, he chargeth with error:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How much more the dwellers in houses of clay, which, in the dust, have their foundation, which are crushed sooner than a moth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Betwixt morning and evening, are they broken in pieces, With none to save, they utterly perish:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is not their tent-rope within them, torn away? They die, disrobed of wisdom!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
