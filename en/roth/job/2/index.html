And the accuser answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from wandering about therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Hast thou applied thy heart unto my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, one who revereth God, and avoideth evil; and still he is holding fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to swallow him up without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the accuser answered Yahweh, and said, Skin for skin, and so, all that a man hath, will he give for his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In very deed, put forth, I pray thee thy hand, and smite unto his bone, and unto his flesh,verily, unto thy face, will he curse thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Behold him! in thy hand,only, his life, preserve thou!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the accuser went forth from the presence of Yahweh,and smote Job with a sore boil, from the sole of his foot, unto his crown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took him a potsherd, to scrape himself therewith; he being seated in the midst of ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said his wife unto him, Art thou still holding fast thine integrity?
