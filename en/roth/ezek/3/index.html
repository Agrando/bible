Thy belly, cause thou to eat and thy bowels, fl thou with this roll which I am giving unto thee. So I did eat, and it became in my mouth, as honey for sweetness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said he unto me, Son of man Go get thee unto the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak with my words, unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For not unto a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue, art thou sent   unto the house of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>liner unto many peoples deep of lip and heavy of tongue, whose words thou couldst not understand,surely if unto them I had sent thee, they would have hearkened unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not be willing to hearken unto thee, for they are not willing to hearken unto me,for all the house of Israel are bold of forehead and hard of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lo! I have made thy face bold like as their faces, and thy forehead bold like as their forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As an adamant harder than flint, have I made thy forehead,thou shalt not fear them neither shalt thou be dismayed at their faces, For a perverse house, they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said he unto me, Son of man. All my words which I shall speak unto thee, receive thou into thy heart and in thine ears, hear thou:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then go get thee unto them of the captivity, unto the cons of thy people, and thou shalt speak unto them and say unto them, Thus saith My Lord Yahweh, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great rushing, Blessed be the glory of Yahweh. From his place!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea the sound of the wings of the living ones, gently touching each other, and the sound of the wheels, along with them, even the sound of a great rushing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away,and I went bitterly, in the rage of my spirit, but the hand of Yahweh upon me was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus came I unto them of the captivity, at Tel-abib. who were dwelling towards he river Chebar and I dwelt where They were dwelling; yea I dwelt there seven days, stunned in their midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh came unto me saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, A watchman, have I appointed thee to the house of Israel,and thou shalt hear, at my mouth a message, and shalt warn them from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I say to the lawless man Thou shalt surely die, and thou hast not given him warning, neither hast spoken to warn the lawless man from his lawless way, to save him- self alive the same lawless man in his iniquity shall die, but his blood, tat thy hand will I require.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whereas when thou hast warned a lawless man, and he hath not turned from his lawlessness and from his lawless way he in his iniquity shall die, but Thou hast delivered thine own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when a righteous man hath turned from his righteousness, and committed perversity, and I have suffered a stumbling- block to be laid before him he shall die, though thou hast not warned him, in his sin I shall he die, neither shall be remembered his righteous deeds which he hath done, but his blood, at thy hand will I require;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whereas when Thou hast warned a righteous man. That a righteous man must not sin and he hath not sinned, he shall surely live in that he took warning, and thou hast delivered thine own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came upon me there the hand of Yahweh,and he said unto me, Arise go forth into the valley, and there, will I speak with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So I arose and went forth into the valley, and lo! there the glory of Yahweh, standing, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar,-and I fell upon my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Spirit entered into me, and caused me to stand upon my feet,and he spake with me and said unto me, Go in shut thyself up, in the midst of thine own house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thouO son of man, lo! they have put upon thee bands, and they will bind thee therewith,-.so that thou go not forth in their midst;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>thy tongue also, will I cause to cleave unto the roof of thy mouth, so shalt thou be dumb and not be to them a reprover, For a perverse house, they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them. Thus saith My Lord Yahweh,He that is minded to hear, let him hear, And he that is minded to forbear, let him forbear! For a perverse house, they are!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
