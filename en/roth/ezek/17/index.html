Yahweh, A great eagle, with large wings of long pinion, full of plumage, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The crown of its young twigs, plucked he off, and brought it into a land of traffic, :in a city of merchants, he t it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he took of the seed of the land, and planted it in a field for seed,- He took it near mighty waters, Like a willow-tree, he set it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it shot forth, and became a spreading vine of lowly stature, Its branches turning towards him, And its roots under him spread,- So it became a vine, And brought forth shoots, And sent forth boughs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass that there was another great eagle, with large wings, and abundant plumage,- And lo! this vine, stretched its roots hungry towards him. And its branches, sent it forth unto him, That he might cause it to drink out of the beds where it was planted:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In a goodly field by mighty waters, was it planted,- That it might bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, That it might become a splendid vine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Say thou, Thus saith My Lord. Yahweh, I Shall it thrive? Its roots, will he not tear up? Its fruit, will he not cut off, that it wither? All the fresh leaves it hath caused to spring forth shall wither without a strong I arm. or many people, to pull it up by its roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Lo! therefore though   planted, shall it thrive? As soon as an east wind toucheth it, will it not utterly wither? On the beds where it sprang up, will it not wither?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then came the word of Yahweh unto me saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Say, I pray thee unto the perverse house, Know ye not what these things are? Say thou Lo! the King of Babylon entered Jerusalem And took her king and her princes, And brought them unto him in Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea took of the seed royal And solemnised with him a covenant, And brought him into an oath, Also the mighty ones of the land, did he take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That, the kingdom might be abased, so as not to lift itself up, By the keeping of his covenant, might be made to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he hath rebelled against him by sending his messengers to Egypt, that there should be given to him horses, and much people. Shall he thrive? Shall he escape that doeth these things? Shall he break a covenant and escape?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As I live, Declareth My Lord Yahweh, Very! in the place where dwelleth the king that made him king, Whose oath he hath despised, And whose covenant he hath broken With him in the midst of Babylon, shall he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither shall Pharaoh with a great force. or with a large gathered host, work with him in the war, by casting up an earthwork and by building a siege-wall, to the cuting off of many lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing he hath despised an oath. by breaking a covenantyea lo! hath given his hand and all these things hath done he shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, Thus saith My Lord Yahweh As I live, Surely it is mine oath which he hath despised, and my covenant which he hath broken, Therefore will I bring it upon his own head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will spread over him my net, And he shall be taken in my snare, And I will bring him into Babylon and will enter into judgment with him there, as to his treachery wherewith he hath been treacherous against me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all his fugitives throughout all his bands by the sword, shall fall, And they who are left, to every wind, shall be scattered,-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus, saith My Lord Yahweh, Therefore will I, Myself, take of the highest branch of the lofty cedar and set it, Of the crown of its young twigs, a tender one, will I pluck off, and I. myself will plant it upon a mountain high and terraced,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the mountain of the height of Israel, will I plant it, And it shall put forth boughs And bear fruit, And become a majestic cedar,- And every bird of every wing shall dwell under it, In the shade of its branches, shall they dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So shall all the trees of the field know that I Yahweh Have laid low the high tree Have exalted the low tree, Have dried up the moist tree, And have caused to flourish the tree, that was dry, I, Yahweh, have spoken, and performed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
