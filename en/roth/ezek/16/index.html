Yet even herewith, wast thou not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How weak was thy heart! Exclaimeth My Lord Yahweh, That thou couldst have done all these things, The doing of a lewd woman without shame:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That thou couldst have but thy brothel at the head of every road, And thy height, couldst have made in every broadway,- Yet becamest not as harlot to lay claim to a harlots hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A wife who committeth adultery, instead of her husband accepteth strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>To all harlots, they give a present, But thou, didst give thy presents to all thy lovers, And didst bribe them to come in unto thee from every side in thine unchastity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And so there came about in thee, the reverse of women, in thine unchastity, In that they did not follow thee for purposes of lewdness, And in that thou gavest a present when no present was given to thee So didst thou become the reverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore O harlot, hear thou the word of Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus saith My Lord Yahweh, Because thy money was poured curl, and thy shame I was uncovered I, in thine unchastity, unto thy lovers,and unto all thine abominable manufactured gods, even as the blood of thy children, whom thou didst deliver up unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Therefore behold me! gathering together all thy lovers unto whom thou didst make thyself pleasant, Even all whom thou lovedst, With all whom thou hatedst, Yea I will gather them together unto thee from every side And will uncover thy shame unto them, And they shall see all thy shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So will I judge thee. with the judgments meted out to adulteresses and shedders of blood,- And will repay thee with the blood of indignation and jealousy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And will deliver thee into their hand. And they shall pull down thy brothel And break in pieces thy heights, And strip thee of thy raiment, And take away thine adorning jewels,- And leave thee utterly naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then will they bring up against thee a gathered host, And they will stone thee with stones,- And cut thee to pieces with their swords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And burn up thy houses with fire, And execute upon thee judgments before the eyes of many women,So will I cause thee to cease from acting unchastely, Moreover also a present, shalt thou not give any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So will I let mine indignation find rest in thee, And my jealousy shall depart from thee,And I will be quiet, and not be provoked any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, But hast enraged me with all these things Therefore also behold! I thy way, upon thine own head, will place Declareth My Lord Yahweh, And thou shalt not commit a crime above all thine abominations</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Lo! every one who useth proverbs, against thee, shall use a proverb saying, Like the mother, so her daughter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The daughter of thy mother, thou art! One abhorring her own husband and her own children, Yea the sister of thy sisters, thou art Who abhorred their own husbands and their own children, Your mother was a Hittite, And your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And thine elder sister, was Samaria, she and her daughters, dwelling on thy left hand, And thy sister younger than thou dwelling on thy right hand was Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet not in their ways, didst thou walk, nor according to their abominations, didst thou do, As though that were quite too little, thou didst corrupt thyself beyond them in all thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I live, Declareth My Lord Yahweh, Very! Sodom thy sister had not done, neither she nor her daughters,as thou and thy daughters have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Lo! this became the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, Pride, fulness of bread, and careless security came to her and to her daughters, And the hand of the oppressed and the needy, she strengthened not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So then they became haughty, and committed abomination before me,- And I took them away. when I saw   ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Nor did Samaria commit lone-half thy sins, But thou didst multiply thine abominations more than they, And didst cause thy sisters to appear righteous I by all the abominations which thou didst commit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Thou also bear thine own reproach, which thou didst adjudge to thy sisters, by thy sins in which thou wast more abominable than they, thou didst make them appear more righteous than thou, Thou also, therefore turn thou pale and bear thine own reproach, for making thy sisters appear righteous!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When therefore I bring back their captivity, The captivity of Sodom and her daughters, And the captivity of Samaria and her daughters Then will I bring back thy captivities in their midst:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>That thou mayest bear thine own reproach, And take to thyself reproach because of all that thou didst in comforting them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When thy sisters Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate, And Samara and her daughters shall return to their former estate Then thou and thy daughters, shall return to your former estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Sodom thy sister was never heard in thy mouth, In the day of thy pride:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Before thy wickedness was discovered, As now,   the reproach of the daughters of Syria and all round about her the daughters of the Philistines, who are despising thee on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>As for thy crime and thine abominations, thou thyself, dost bear them, Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For Thus, saith My Lord, Yahweh, Therefore will I deal with thee just as thou hast dealt,- In that thou didst despise an oath by breaking a covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Therefore will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, And will establish for thee a covenant age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Thou shalt therefore remember thy ways and take to thyself reproach, by receiving thy sisters. The older than thou, And the younger than thou,- And I will give them unto thee for daughters Though not by thine own covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>But I myself, will establish my covenant with thee And thou shalt know that I, am Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>To the end thou mayest remember and turn pale, and there be to thee no more, an opening of mouth, because of thy reproach,- In that I have accepted a propitiatory covering for thee as to all that thou hast done, Declareth My Lord.
