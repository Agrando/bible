And the torn, have ye not hound up, And that which was driven out, have ye not brought back, And that which was straying, have ye not sought out; But with force, have ye ruled them and with rigour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; And they became food for every wild beast of the field. So were they scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My sheep did wander through all the mountains, And over every high hl,- And over all the face of the and, were my sheep scattered, And there was none to inquire And none to seek out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore ye shepherds, hear ye the word of Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As I live, Declareth My Lord Yahweh, Surely because my flock became a prey. And my flock became food for every wild beast of the field, through having no shepherd, Neither did my shepherds inquire after the flock, But the shepherds tended themselves. And my flock, they tended not</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore ye shepherds, hear ye the word of Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus, saith My Lord. Yahweh, Behold me! against the shepherds So then I will require my flock at their hand And will cause them to cease tending the fleck, Neither shall the shepherds any longer tend themselves, But I will deliver my flock out of their mouth, that they may not be their food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For Thus saith My Lord. Yahweh,- Here am I myself Therefore will I inquire after my flock and seek them out:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day he is in the midst of his sheep that are scattered, So! will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all the places where they were scattered in the day of cloud and thick darkness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will bring them out from among the peoples And will gather them out of the lands, And will bring them upon their own soil, And will tend them Upon the mountains of Israel, In the ravines. And in all the habitable places of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In good pastures, will I feed them, And on the mountains of the height of Israel, shall be their fold, There, shall they lie down in a fold that is good, And on pasture that is fat, shall they feed. among the mountains of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>myself will tend my flock.

And that which hath been driven away, will I bring back, And that width is tern, will I bind up, And the weak, will I strengthen,- But the fat and the strong, will I watch I will feed them with justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as for you O my flock, Thus saith My Lord. Yahweh: Behold me! judging between one kind of small cattle and another as well the rams as the he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is it too small a thing for you that on the good pasture, ye feed, But the remainder of your pastures, ye must also trample down with your feet? Or that of the pure waters, ye drink But the waters left remainingwith your feet, ye must needs foul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And my flock On what hath been trampled down by your feet, may feed, And of what hath been fouled by your feet, may drink? O</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore Thus, saith My Lord Yahweh, unto them: Here am I myself. Therefore will I judge between fat sheep and lean sheep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because with the side and with the shoulder, ye do thrust, And with your horns, ye do push all the sick, Until you have scattered them abroad</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore will I bring salvation to my flock, and they shall be no longer a prey,but I will judge between one sheep and another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will raise up over them one shepherd And he shall tend them, Even my servant David, he will tend them, And libel will become to them a shepherd;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, I, Yahweh will become to them a God.
