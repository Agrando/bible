And blood, ye do shed; And the land, shall ye inherit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ye men have taken your stand by your sword. Ye women have wrought abomination, And every manwith the wife of his neighbour, have ye defiled yourselves; And the land, shall ye inherit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith My Lord Yahweh, As I live, surely, they who are in the waste places by the sword, shall fall, And him who is on the face of the field to the wild beast, have I given to be devoured,- And they who are in the mountain holds and in the pits :by pestilence, shall die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment, So shall be made to cease the pride of her strength,- And the mountains of Israel shall be too desolate for any to pass through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So shall they know that I, am Yahweh, When I makes the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thou therefore Son of man, the sons of thy people who are talking against thee Near the walls and in the entrances of the houses, are speaking one with another, every man with his brother saying. Come in we pray you and heat, what is the word that is coming forth from Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That they may come unto thee as people do come And may sit before thee as my people, And they will hear thy words, But the, words themselves, they not do, though fond with their mouths, they seem to be, After their unjust gain, their heart is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And lo! thou art to them As a bewitching song, Of one with a beautiful voice. And skilfully touching the strings, So will they hear thy words, And yet be going to do none of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when it cometh Lo! it is coming, Then shall they know that a prophet hath been in their midst.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
