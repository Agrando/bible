Yahweh, have myself answered him thereby. By the multitude of his manufactured gods:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>To the end the house of Israel may be taken by their own hearts,in that they have estranged themselves from me, through their manufactured godsall of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore say thou unto the house of Israel Thus saith My Lord.
