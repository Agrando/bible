Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then fell upon me the Spirit of Yahweh, and he said unto me SayThus, saith Yahweh, Thus have ye said O house of Israel, Yea the things that come up on your spirit, know every one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ye have multiplied your slain in this city,- And have fled her streets with slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore Thus, saith My Lord Yahweh, Your Main. whom ye have laid in her midst, They are the flesh, and She is the caldron,when ye are taken out of her midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A sword, have ye feared, And a sword, will I bring in upon you, Declareth My Lord Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So will I take you forth out of her midst, and will deliver you into the hand of foreigners, and will execute upon you judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By the sword, shah ye fall, Upon the boundary of Israel, will I judge you, So shall, ye know that a Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This city shall not serve you for a caldron, Neither shall, ye, serve in the midst thereof for flesh,Near the boundary of Israel, will I judge you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So hat ye now that I am Yahweh, In whose statutes, ye have not walked And whose appointments, ye have not executed, But according to the appointments of the nations that are round about you, have ye done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass as I prophesied, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died,so then I fell down upon my face and made outcry with a loud voice and said Alas!
