And who shall abide the glow of his anger? His wrath, hath been poured forth like fire, and, the rocks, have been broken down because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Good is Yahweh, as a protection in the day of distress,and one who acknowledgeth them who seek refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, with an overflow rolling on, a full end, will he make of them who rise up against him,and, his foes, will he pursue into darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What can ye devise against Yahweh?
