And he said Behold me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he saidTake, I pray thee, thy son, thine only one, whom thou lovest, even, Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah and cause him to ascend there as an ascending-sacrifice, on one of the mountains which I shall name unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took his two young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the pieces of wood for an ascending-sacrifice, and mounted and went his way unto the place which God had named to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It was, on the third day, that Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham said unto his young menTarry by yourselves here with the ass, but I and the young man must go yonder,that we may bow ourselves down and return unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Abraham took the pieces of wood for the ascending-sacrifice, and laid them on Isaac his son, and took in his own hand the fire and the knife, and they went on their way, both of them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Isaac unto Abraham his father, then said he; My father! And he said, Behold me, my son, And he said, Behold the fire, and the pieces of wood,but where is the lamb, for an ascending-sacrifice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham said, God, will provide for himself the lamb for an ascending-sacrifice, my son! So they went on their way, both of them, together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then came they into the place which God had named to him, and Abraham built there the altar, and aid in order the pieces of wood, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, above the pieces of wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abraham put forth his hand, and took the knife,to slay his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then called out unto him the messenger of Yahweh out of the heavens, and said. Abraham, Abraham! And he said Behold me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he said, Do not put forth thy hand unto the young man, neither do to himanything at all,for, now, know I that one who reverest God, thou art, when thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only one, from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo! a ram, behind, caught in a thicket by his horns, and Abraham went, and took the ram, and caused him to ascend as an ascending-sacrifice instead of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh,as to which it is still said to-day, In the mountain of Yahweh, will provision be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then called out the messenger of Yahweh unto Abraham,a second time out of the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said, By myself, have I sworn is the oracle of Yahweh,Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That I will, richly bless, thee, and, abundantly multiply, thy seed, as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is on the lip of the sea,that thy seed may take possession of the gate of his foes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves in thy seed,Because thou didst hearken unto my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they mounted, and went on their way together unto Beer-sheba,and Abraham dwelt in Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying,Behold!
