And they said: From haran, are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Know ye Laban, son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, Is it well with him. And they said, Well, but lo! Rachel his daughter, coming in with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said Lo! the day is yet high, it is not time for gathering together the cattle,water the sheep, and go feed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, We cannot, until that all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll away the stone, from off the mouth of the well,and then can we water the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>While yet he was speaking with them, Rachel, had come in with the sheep which belonged to her father, for a shepherdess, was she.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mothers brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mothers brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled away the stone from off the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban his mothers brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel,and lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers brother, and that he was Rebekahs son, then ran she, and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sisters son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fondly kissed him, and brought him into his house,when he recounted to Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him, Surely, my bone and my flesh, art thou. So he abode with him a month of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said Laban to Jacob, Is it because my brother, thou art, that thou shouldst serve me for naught? Come tell me! What shall be thy wages?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, Laban, had two daughters,the name of the elder, Leah, and the name of the younger, Rachel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, the eyes of Leah were weak,whereas, Rachel, was comely in form and comely in countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Jacob loved Rachel,and he said, I will serve thee seven years, for Rachel thy younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said, Better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man,Abide with me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Jacob served for Rachelseven years,and they became, in his eyes, as single days, for his love to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jacob unto Laban: Come give me my wife, for fulfilled are my days,that I may go in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a banquet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her in unto him,and he went in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave her Zilpah, his handmaid, unto Leah his daughter. as handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that lo! it was Leah,and he said unto Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? Was it not, for Rachel, I served with thee? Wherefore then hast thou deceived me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said, It must not be done so in our place,to give the later-born before the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfil the week of this one,then must we give thee, the other one also, for the service wherewith thou shalt serve with me, yet seven years more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled the week of this one,and he gave him Rachel his daughterto him to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid,to be hers as a handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So he went in, unto Rachel also, and loved, Rachel also, more than Leah,and he served with him, yet seven years more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, when Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, he granted her to bear children,whereas, Rachel, was barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Leah conceived, and hare a son, and called his name Reuben,for she said, Because, Yahweh hath looked upon my humiliation, For, now, will my husband love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again, and bare a son, and said. Because Yahweh heard that, I, was I hated, he gave me, this one also. So she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again and bare a son, and said, Nowthis time, will my husband he bound unto me, For I have borne him three sons,For this cause, called she his name Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again and bare a son, and said This time, will I praise Yahweh, For which cause, she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
