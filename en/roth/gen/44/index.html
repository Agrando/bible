So he did, according to the word of Joseph, which he had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>By the time, the morning, was light, the men, had been sent away, they, and their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They themselves, had gone out of the citythey had not gone far, when Joseph said to him who was over his house, Rise chase after the men,so shalt thou overtake them and shalt say unto them, Wherefore have ye requited evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby, he himself, doth divine? Ye have done evil in what ye have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he overtook them,and spake unto them these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said unto him, Wherefore should my lord speak such words as these? Far be thy servants, from doing such a thing as this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lo! the silver that we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan,how then could we steal out of the house of thy lord, silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomsoever of thy servants it can be found, he shall die,and, we also, will become my lords servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Yea, now, according to your words, so, let it be,he with whom it is found, shall be my servant, Ye, however, shall be clear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So they hastened and took down each man his sack to the ground,and opened each man his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then made he thorough search, with the eldest, he began, and with the youngest, he ended,and the cup was found in the sack of Benjamin!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they rent their mantles,and laded each man his ass, and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brethren came into the house of Joseph, he, yet being there,and fell down before him to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said to them, What is this deed which ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I, can even divine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said JudahWhat shall we say to my lord, how shall we speak and how shall we justify ourselves,when, God himself, hath found out the iniquity of thy servants? Behold us! my lords servants, both we, and he in whose hand the cup hath been found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Far be it from me to do this thing! The man in whose hand the cup hath been found, he, shall be my servant, but as for you, go ye up in peace unto your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah drew near unto him, and saidPardon my lord! Pray let thy servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and do not let thine anger be kindled against thy servant,for, thus, art, thou as Pharaoh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It was, my lord, who asked his servants, saying,Have ye a father, or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So we said unto my lord, We have an aged father, and the child of his old age a youth,his brother, being dead, he alone, is left of his mother and, his father, loveth him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So then thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,that I may set mine eyes upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father,as surely as he leaveth his father, so surely will he, die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother do come down with you, ye shall not again behold my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So it came to pass when we had gone up unto thy servant, my father, that we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said our father,Go again buy us a little food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We cannot go down,If our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down, for we cannot see the face of the man if, our youngest brother, is not with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then said thy servant my father, unto us,Ye yourselves, know, that, two, did my wife bear to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the one went forth from me, and I saidCertainly he hath been, torn in pieces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I have never seen him since. As surely as ye take, this one also, away from before my face and there befall him any mischief, so surely shall ye bring down my grey hairs, with misfortune to hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now, therefore, as surely as I go in unto thy servant my father, and, the lad, is not with us,seeing that his soul is bound up with the lads soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so surely shall it come to pass that when he sooth that the lad is not with us, then will he die. So shall thy servants bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For thy servant, became surety for the lad, while away from my father saying,If I bring him not unto thee, then will I count myself a sinner against my father all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now, therefore, I pray thee let thy servant remain instead of the lad, as servant to my lord,but as for the lad, let him go up with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how can I go up unto my father, should the lad, not be with me? lest I look on the calamity, that shall find out my father,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
