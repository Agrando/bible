So they went on yet more to hate him, because of his dreams and because of his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then dreamed he, yet another, dream, and related it to his brethren, and said:Lo! I have dreamed a dream, yet again, Lo! then, the sun and the moon, and eleven stars, were bowing themselves down to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he related it unto his father, and unto his brethren,and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream which thou hast dreamed? Shall we, indeed come in, I, and thy mother and thy brethren, to bow our-selves down to thee to the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then were his brethren jealous of him, but his father, marked the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now his brethren went their way,to feed their fathers flock in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Israel said unto Joseph Are not, thy brethren, feeding the flock in Shechem? Come on! and let me send thee unto them. And he said to him Behold me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he said to himGo, I pray thee, look after the welfare of thy brethren, and the welfare of the flock, and bring me back word. And he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came in towards Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a man found him, and to! he was wandering about in the field, so the man asked him sayingWhat seekest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, My brethren, am, I, seeking,do tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding their flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said, They have broken up from hence, for I heard them saying Let us go our way towards Dothan. So Joseph went after his brethren, and found them, in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they saw him afar off,and, ere yet he drew near unto them, they conspired against him, to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said each man unto his brother, Lo! that master of dreams yonder, coming in!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, therefore, come! let us slay him and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say A cruel beast, hath devoured him,And let us see what will become of his dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Reuben heard it, and rescued him out of their hand, and said Let us not smite him, so as to take his life!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben said unto them Do not shed blood! Cast him into this pit, which is in the wilderness, but put not forth, a hand, against him! that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him unto his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So it came to pass, when Joseph had come in unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph of his tunic, the long tunic which was upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and took him, and cast him into the pit, but the pit, was empty, there was in it no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had sat down to eat bread, they lifted up their eyes and looked, and lo! a caravan of Ishmaelites, coming in from Gilead,and, their camels, were bearing tragacanth gum, and balsam and cistus-gum, they were going their way, to take them down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Judah said unto his brethren,What profit that we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites; but let not, out own hand, be upon him, for our own brother, our own flesh, is he And his brethren hearkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there passed by certain Midianites travelling merchants, so they drew forth and uplifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites, for twenty pieces of silver,and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Reuben returned unto the pit, and lo Joseph was not in the pit, so he rent his clothes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and returned unto his brethren, and said,The, lad, is not! And, I, oh where can I, go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they took Josephs tunic,and slaughtered a buck of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and sent the long tunic and brought it in unto their father, and said This, have we found! Examine, we pray thee, whether it is the tunic of thy son, or not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So he examined it, and saidThe tunic of my son! A cruel beast hath devoured him,torn in piecestorn in pieces, is Joseph!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins,and mourned over his son many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to console him but he refused to be consoled, and saidSurely I will go down unto my son mourning to hades! And his father wept for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now, the Midianites, sold him into Egypt,to Potiphar courtier of Pharaoh, chief of the royal executioners.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
