And they said, From the land of Canaan, to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joseph recognised his brethren,whereas they, recognised him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed regarding them,so he said unto themSpies, are, ye! to see the nakedness of the land, have ye come in!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said unto him, Nay, my lord,but, thy servants, are come to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All of us, are, sons of one man,honest men, are we: thy servants are not, spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said unto him,Nay! but, the nakedness of the land, are ye come in to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said: We, thy twelve servants, are, brethren, sons of one man in the and of Canaan,and lo! the youngest: is with our father this day, and, the one, is not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph said unto them,The very thing, that I spake unto you, sayingSpies, are, ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hereby, shall ye be proved,By the life of Pharaoh, ye shall not go forth from hence, save only by the coming in of your youngest brother hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Sendfrom among youone that he may fetch your brother, but be, ye, held as prisoners, that your words may be proved whether, truth, is with you,and, if not, by the life of Pharaoh, surely, spies, ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he drew them all together into ward, for three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said unto them on the third day, This, do and live,God himself, do, I, revere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye, are, honest men, one brother of you shall be kept as a prisoner in your house of ward,but, ye, go, take in corn for the famine of your houses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and your youngest brother, shall ye bring in unto me, that your words may be confirmed, and ye die not. And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said each man unto his brotherVerily guilty, we are, respecting our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul when he appealed unto us for favour and we hearkened not,therefore, hath come in unto us this distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben responded to them, sayingSpake I not unto you saying, Do not sin against the child! And ye hearkened not? His very blood, therefore lo! it is required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, they, knew not that Joseph was hearkening,for, the interpreter, was between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he turned away from them, and wept,then came back unto them and spake unto them, and took away from them Simeon, and bound him prisoner before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then commanded Joseph that their bags should be filled with corn, and their silver be returned each mans into his sack, and provision be given for the journey,and it was done to them thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So they lifted up their corn on their asses,and went their way, from thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the first opened his sack to give fodder to his ass at the inn,and beheld his silver, yea there, it was in the mouth of his sack!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So he said unto his brethren My silver hath been returned, yea verily, there it is in my sack! Then went forth their heart and they turned tremblingeach man unto his brother saying. Wharf is this that God hath done to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they came in unto Jacob their father to the land of Canaan,and told him all that had befallen them saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man that is lord of the land spake unto us harsh things,and then delivered us up. as spies of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we said unto him Honest men, are, we,we are not spies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Twelve brethren, are, we, sons of our father,the one, is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then said the man the lord of the land unto us, Hereby, shall I get to know that honest men, ye are,One brother of you, leave ye remaining with me, and corn for the famine of your houses, take ye and go your way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And bring ye in your youngest brother unto me, So must I get to know that ye are, not spies, but are honest men: Your brother, will I give up to you, and with the land, shall ye traffic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass when, they, were emptying their, sacks then lo! each mans bundle of silver, was in his sack,and when they beheld their bundles of silverthey and their father, they were afraid,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob their father said unto them, Me, have ye bereaved,Joseph, is not, and, Simeon, is not, and Benjamin, ye would take! Against me, have happened all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then spake Reuben unto his father saying, My two sons, shalt thou put to death, if I bring him not unto thee,Come give him up upon my hand, and I, will restore him unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, My son shall not go down with you,For, his brother, is dead and, he alone, is left, and as surely as there befall him any mischief by the way wherein ye go, so surely shall ye bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto hades.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
