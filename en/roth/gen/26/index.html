Isaaclaughing with Rebekah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Abimelech called for Isaac, and said, But to she is, thy wife! How then, saidst thou, She is, my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because, I said, Lest I die on her account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then, said, Abimelech, What is this thou hast done to us? A little more, and one of the people might have lien with thy wife, so shouldst thou have brought upon us, guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abimelech commanded all the people saying,He that toucheth this man or his wife, shall surely be put to death</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year, a hundredfold,seeing that Yahweh had blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the man waxed great,and went on and on waxing great until that he had waxed exceeding great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he came to have possessions of flocks gild possessions of herds, and a large body of servants,and the Philistines envied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as for all the wells which the servants of his father digged, in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stepped them up, and filled them with dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Abimelech said unto Isaac,Get thee from us, for thou hast become far mightier than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Isaac went from thence,and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Isaac again digged the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father, and which the Philistines stopped up after the death of Abraham,and he called their names, after the names which his father called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Isaacs servants digged in the valley,and found there a well of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the herdmen of Gerar disputed with the herdmen of Isaac saying, Ours, is thee, water! So he called the name of the well Esek, because they had stirred up a quarrel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they digged another well, and they disputed over that also,so he called the name thereof Sitnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he moved on from thence and digged another well, and they disputed not for it,so he called the name thereof. Rehoboth, and said, For, now, hath Yahweh made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And be went up from thence, to Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Yahweh appeared unto him the same night, and said, I, am the God of Abraham thy father,Do not fear for with thee, am, I, And I will bless thee and multiply thy seed, For the sake of Abraham my servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he builded there all altar and called on the name of Yahweh, and spread out there, his rent,and the servants of Isaac cut out there a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, Abimelech, came unto him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol, commander of his host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore have ye come in mite me, seeing that, ye, hated me, and sent me away from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said: We, saw plainly, that Yahweh was with thee, so we said, Let there be we pray thee an oath betwixt us both, betwixt us and thee,and let us solemnise a covenant with thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That, thou wilt not do wrong by us, according as we touched not thee, and according as we did by thee nothing but good, and then sent thee away in peace, thee who, now, art blessed of Yahweh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So he made for them a banquet, and they did eat and drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and rose up early in the morning, and took an oath each man to his brother, so Isaac let them go, and they departed from him in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass, on the same day, that the servants of Isaac came in, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So he called it, Shibah. For this cause, hath the name of the city, been Beer-sheba, unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith, daughter of Beeri. the Hittite; and Basemath, daughter of Elon, the Hittite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they became a bitterness of spirit, to Isaac and to Rebekah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
