And they said, Thus, shalt thou do as thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Abraham hastened towards the tent unto Sarah,and said, Hasten thou three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make hearth-cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And unto the herd, ran Abraham,and took a calf tender and good and gave unto the young man, and he hastened to make it ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took butter and milk and the calf that he had made ready, and set before them,while, he, was standing near them under the tree, they did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said unto him, As to Sarah thy wife And he said Lo!   in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I will, surely return, unto thee at the quickening season,and lo! a son for Sarah thy wife. Now Sarah, was hearkening at the opening of the tent, it, being behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Abraham and Sarah, were old, far gone in days,it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then Sarah laughed within herself, saying: After I am past age, hath there come to me pleasure, my lord, also being old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh said unto Abraham,Wherefore now did Sarah laugh saying. Can it really and truly be that I should bear, seeing that have become old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anything, too wonderful for Yahweh? At the appointed time, I will return unto thee, at the quickening season and Sarah, shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not, For she was afraid. And he saidNay! but thou didst laugh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the men rose up from hence, and looked out over the face of Sodom,Abraham also going with them to set them on their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, Yahweh, had said,Am I going to hide from Abraham what I do,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>when, Abraham, shall surely become, a great and mighty nation,and all the nations of the earth, shall be blessed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I have become his intimate friend, To the end that he may command his sons and his house after him, so shall they keep the way of Yahweh, by doing righteousness and justice. To the end that Yahweh may bring in for Abraham, what he hath spoken concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Yahweh said, The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah, because it hath become great,And their sin, because it hath become exceeding grievous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Let me go down, pray, and let me behold, whether according to their outcry which hath come in unto me, they have done altogether, And if not. I must know!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the men turned from thence, and went their way, towards Sodom,but, Yahweh was yet standing before Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So then Abraham drew near and said, Wilt thou really sweep away, the righteous with the lawless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Peradventure there are fifty righteous, in the midst of the city, Wilt thou really sweep away, and not spare the place, for the sake of the fifty righteous which are therein?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Far be it from thee! to do after this manner. to put to death the righteous with the lawless! Then should righteous and lawless be alike, Far be it from thee! Shall, the Judge of all the earth not do justice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Yahweh said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous in the midst of the city, then will I spare all the place for their sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham responded and said,Behold I pray thee I have ventured to speak unto My Lord, though I am dust and ashes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peradventure there may lack, of the fifty righteous, five, Wilt thou destroy for five all the city? And he said, I will not destroy, if I find there forty and five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he added, yet once more, to speak unto him, and said, Peradventure there may be found thereforty. And he saidI will not do it, for the sake of the forty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said Let it not, I pray thee, be vexing to My Lord, but let me speak, Peradventure there may be found therethirty And be said, I will not to it, if I find therethirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he sad Behold, I pray thee, I have ventured to speak unto My Lord, Peradventure there may be found theretwenty. And he said I will not destroy it, for the sake of the twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said, Let it not, I pray thee, be vexing to My Lord, but let me speak only this once, Peradventure there may be found thereten. And he said, I will not destroy   , for the sake of the ten!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Yahweh went his way, when he had made an end. of speaking unto Abraham,Abraham, also returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
