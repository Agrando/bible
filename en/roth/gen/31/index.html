it was not with him as afore-time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then said Yahweh unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred,that I may be with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Jacob sent, and called for Rachel and for Leah, to the field unto his flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said to them, Beholding, am I the face of your father, that it is not towards me as aforetime,nevertheless, the God of my father, hath been with me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and, ye, know that with all my vigour, have I served your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, your father, hath deceived me, and hath changed my wages ton times,yet God hath not suffered him to deal harmfully with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If thus he saith, The speckled, shall be thy wages, then do all the flock bring forth speckled,But if thus he saith, The ring-straked, shall be thy wages, then do all the flock bring forth ring-straked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So hath God stripped away the herds of your father, and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass in the season when the flock were in heat, then lifted I mine eyes and beheld in a dream,and lo! the he-goats that were leaping upon the flock, were ring-straked speckled and dappled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the messenger of God said unto me in a dream, Jacob! and I said, Behold me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he said Lift, I pray thee, thine eyes and behold All, the he-goats that are leaping upon the flock are ring-straked, speckled, and dappled,for I have seen all that Laban, has been doing to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I, am the GOD of Beth-el, where thou didst anoint a pillar, where thou didst vow to me a vow,Now, rise, go forth out of this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then responded Rachel and Leah, and said to him,Have we any longer a portion or an inheritance in the house of our father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Are we not accounted, aliens, to him seeing that having sold us, he hath then gone on devouring, our silver?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Surely all the riches which God hath stripped off from our father, unto us, it belongeth, and unto our sons,Now, therefore, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Jacob arose,and mounted his sons and his wives on the camels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and drave away all his herds and all his goods which he had gathered, the gains he had gained, which he had gathered in Padan-aram; that he might go in unto Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, Laban, had gone, to shear his sheep,so Rachel stole the household gods that belonged to her father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus Jacob stole away unawares to Laban, the Syrian,in that he had not told him that he was about to flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he fled, theand all that he had, and he arose, and passed over the River,and set his face towards the mountain of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it was told Laban, on the third day,that Jacob had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him a journey of seven daysand overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God went in unto Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night,and said to him Take heed to thyself that thou speak not with Jacob either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So then Laban came up with Jacob,Jacob, having pitched his tent in the mountain, Laban, also, with his brethren pitched in the mountain of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then said Laban to Jacob, What hadst thou done, that thou shouldst steal away unawares to me,and shouldst carry off my daughters, as captives of the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore didst thou secretly flee, and rob me,and didst not tell me, that I might send thee away with rejoicing and with songs, with timbrel and with lyre;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now, hast thou done, foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in the power of my hand, to deal with thee for harm,but the God of your father, last night, spake unto me, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not with Jacob, either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, now, though thou, didst even take thy journey, because thou, didst sorely long, for the house of thy father,, wherefore didst thou steal away my gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob answered and said unto Laban,Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest thou take by force thy daughters from me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He with whom thou find thy gods, shall not live! Before our brethren, note thou for thyself what is with me and take what is thine. Neither did Jacob know that, Rachel, had stolen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then entered Laban into the tent of Jacob and into the tent of Leah and into the tent of the two handmaids, and found nothing,then went he forth out of the tent of Leah, and entered into the tent of Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now Rachel, had taken the household gods and put them in the basket-saddle of the camel, and taken her seat upon them. And Laban felt about throughout all the tent, and found them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she said unto her father, Let it not be vexing in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise up at thy presence, for, the way of women, is upon me. So he made search, but found not the household gods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it was vexing to Jacob and he contended with Laban,and Jacob responded and said to Laban, What was my trespass, what my sin, that thou shouldst have come burning after me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now that thou hast felt about among all my goods, what hast thou found of the goods of thine own house? Set it out here, right before my brethren and thy brethren,that they may give sentence betwixt us two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This twenty years time, have, I, been with theeThy ewes and thy she-goats, have not cast their young,And the rams of thy flock, have I not eaten,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The torn, have I not brought in unto theeI bare the loss, At my hand, didst thou require it,Stolen by day, or stolen by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thus have I beenBy day, drought hath consumed me, And, frost, by, night,So that my sleep fled away from mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>This, hath been my lot twenty years in thy house,I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, And six years for thy sheepAnd thou didst change my wages ten times:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But that the God of my fatherThe God of Abraham, and the Dread of IsaacProved to he mine, Surely even now, empty, hadst thou let me go? My humiliation and the wearying toil of my hands, God had seen, And therefore gave sentence last night!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then responded Laban and said unto Jacobthe daughters, are my daughters, And the sons, are my sons, And the sheep are my sheep, And, all that, thou, beholdest, To me doth it belong! But to my daughters, what can I do to these this day, Or to their sons whom they have borne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now, therefore, come on! Let us solemnise a covenant, I and thou,So shall it be a witness betwixt me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So Jacob took a stone,and set it up as a pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then said Jacob to his brethrenGather stones. And they took stones and made a heap,and they did eat there, by the heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Laban called it, Jegar-sahadutha,but, Jacob, called it, Galeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then said Laban: This heap, be witness betwixt me, and thee, to-day. For this cause, is the name thereof called Galeed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>also, The Watch Tower, as to which it is said, Yahweh watch betwixt me and thee, when we are parted one from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If thou oppress my daughters, or if thou take wives besides my daughters,there may be no man with ussee! God, be witness betwixt me, and thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Laban said to JacobBehold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have set betwixt me, and thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>A witness, be this heap, and, a witness, the pillar,That, I, am not to pass, unto thee, over this heap, And, thou, art not to pass, unto me, over this heap and this pillar for harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The Gods of Abraham and the Gods of Nahor judge betwixt usthe Gods of their fathers. And Jacob sware by the Dread of his father Isaac:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and Jacob offered sacrifice in the mountain, and called on his brethren to eat bread. So they did eat bread, and tarried the night in the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And Laban rose up early in the morning, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban went his way and returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
