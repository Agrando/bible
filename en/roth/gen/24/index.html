God of my lord Abraham, who hath not withdrawn his lovingkindness and his faithfulness, from my lord,Ibeing in the way, Yahweh led me unto the house of the brethren of my lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the young woman ran, and told the household of her mother,according to these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, Rebekah, had a brother, whose name, was Laban,so Laban ran unto the man outside, unto the fountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister saying, Thus, did the man speak unto me, that he came unto the man, and lo! he was standing by the camels near the fountain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he said, Come in. thou blessed of Yahweh,Wherefore shouldst thou stand outside, when I have made ready the house and a place for the camels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the man came in towards the house, and ungirded the camels,and there was given him straw and fodder for the camels, and water for bathing his own feet and the feet of the men who were with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and   was set before him to eat, But he said, I cannot eat, until I have spoken my words. And he saidSpeak!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said he,Servant of Abraham, am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now, Yahweh, having blessed my lord exceedingly, and made him great,and given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels, and asses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then did Sarah wife of my lord, bear a son to my lord, after she had become old,so he gave to him all that he had;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And my lord put me on oath saying,Thou shalt not take a wife for my son, of the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land, I, am dwelling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but, unto the house of my father, shalt thou go, and unto my family,and take a wife for my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So I said unto my lord,Peradventure the woman will not follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said unto me,Yahweh, before whom I have walked to and fro, will send his messenger with thee, so shall he prosper thy way, and thou shalt take a wife for my son out of my kindred and out of the house of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then, shalt thou clear thyself from mine oath, for thou shalt go in unto my kindred,and, if they will not grant her unto thee, then shalt thou be clear from mine oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So I came in to-day, unto the fountain,and I said O Yahweh God of my lord Abraham! if, I pray thee thou art prospering my way whereon am going,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>here, am I stationed by the fountain of water,so then it shall come to pass that, the maiden that is coming forth to draw, and I shall say unto her Let me drink. I pray thee a little water out of thy pitcher;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and she shall say unto me Both, thou, drink, and for thy camels also, will I draw, the same, shall be the woman whom Yahweh hath appointed for the son of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Ere yet, I, could make an end of speaking unto mine own heart, lo! then Rebekah, coming forth, with her pitcher on her shoulder, and she went down to the fountain, and drew,and I said unto her Let me drink I pray thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So she hastened and lowered her pitcher from off her, and said. Drink! and to thy camels also, will I give to drink,So I drank and the camels also, she let drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said Daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom, Milcah, bare to him,Then put I the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and bowed my head and bent myself down unto Yahweh,and I blessed Yahweh God of my lord Abraham, who had led me in a way of faithfulness, to take the daughter of the brother of my lord for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now, therefore, if ye are dealing in lovingkindness and faithfulness with my lord, tell me,and, if not, tell me, that I may turn unto the right hand or unto the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then answered Laban and Bethuel and said, from Yahweh, hath come forth the word,we cannot speak unto thee ill or well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Go! Rebekah, is before thee, Take her and go thy way,And let her become wife unto the son of thy lord, as Yahweh hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And it came to pass when Abrahams servant heard their words, that he bowed himself down towards the earth unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment, and gave unto Rebekah,and precious things, gave he to her brother and to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they did eat and drink he, and the men who were with him, and they tarried the night,and when they arose in the morning, he said Let me go unto my lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Then said her brother and her mother, Let the young woman remain with us some days or rather ten,After that, she shall go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And he said unto them, Do not hinder me, when, Yahweh, hath prospered my journey,Let me go, that I may take my journey unto my lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then said they, We must call the young woman and ask at her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>So they called Rebekah and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So they let go Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abrahams servant and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, Our sister! become thou, thousands of ten thousands,And let thy seed take possession of the gate of them that hate them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then mounted Rebekah and her young woman and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man,so the servant took Rebekah. and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Now, Isaac, had come in at the entrance, of Beer-lahai-roi,for, he, was dwelling in the land of the South:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>and Isaac came forth to meditate in the field at the approach of evening,so he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo! camels, coming in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac,so she alighted with haste from off the camel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>and said unto the servant, Who is this man that is walking in the field to meet us? And the servant said, That, is my lord. So she took the veil and covered herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And the servant recounted to Isaac,all the things which he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother; thus he took Rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her,and Isaac consoled himself, for the loss of his mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
