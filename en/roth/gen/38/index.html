For he said, Lest, he also, die, like his brethren. So Tamar went her way, and remained in the house of her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the days were multiplied, then died Shuas daughter, Judahs wife,and Judah consoled himself and went up unto his sheep shearers, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, towards Timnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was told Tamar saying,Lo! thy father-in-law is going up towards Timnah, to the shearing of his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So she put off from her the garments of her widowhood and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself up, and sat down in the entrance of, Enaim, which is by the way towards Timnah,for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she, had not been given him to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Judah, seeing her, reckoned her to be an unchaste woman,for she had covered her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So he turned aside unto her. by the way, and said Grant it! I pray thee, let me come in unto thee! For he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, if thou shouldst come in unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I, will send a kid of the goats from the flock.

And She saidThy signet-ring, and thy guard, and thy staff that is in thy hand. So he gave them to her and came in unto her and she conceived by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then she arose and went her way, and put off her veil from her,and put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge at the hand of the woman,but he found her not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he asked the men of her place saying. Where is the devotee, she that was in Enaim, by the way? And they said,Then hath been here no devotee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then returned he unto Judah, and saidI found her not,moreover also, the men of the place said, There hath been here no devotee..</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah said: Thou must take it to her, lest we become a contempt,lo! I sent this kid, and, thou, hast not found her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass that about three months after, it was told Judah, sayingTamar thy daughter-in-law hath been guilty of unchastity, moreover also lo! she hath conceived by unchastity. Then said Judah, Bring her forth and let her be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When, she, was about to be brought forth, then, she herself, sent unto her father-in-law saying, By the man to whom these belong, have I, conceived! And she saidExamine, I pray thee, to whom belong the signet-ring, and the guard, and the staffthese!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Judah examined them and saidMore righteous than I! forasmuch, as I had not given her to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, it came to pass at the time of her travail, that lo! twins, were in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass when she was in travail, that one put forth a hand,so the midwife took and bound upon his hand a crimson thread, sayingThis came first!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And so it was that, no sooner had he withdrawn his hand, than lo! his brother had come. And she said, Wherefore hast thou made for thyself a breach? So his name was called Perez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And afterwards, came his brother, on whose hand was the crimson thread,so his name was called, Zerah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
