But if thou do not right, at the entrance a sin-bearer is lying,Unto thee, moreover, shall be his longing, though, thou, rule over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Cain said unto Abel his brother Let us go into the field And it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Yahweh unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said know not, the keeper of my brother, am, I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, What hast thou done? With a voice, the shed-blood of thy brother is crying out to me from the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now therefore, accursed, art thou,from the ground which hath opened her mouth, to receive the shed-blood of thy brother at thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Though thou till the ground, it shall not go on to give its vigour to thee. A wanderer and a fugitive, shalt thou be in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said unto YahwehGreater is my punishment than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Lo! thou has driven me out, this day, from off the face of the ground And from thy face, shall I be hid, So shall I become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth. And it shall come to pass, whosoever findeth me, will slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Yahweh said to himNot so, whosoever slayeth Cain sevenfold, shall it be avenged. So Yahweh set, for Cain, a sign, that none finding him should smite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Cain went forth from the presence of Yahweh,and dwelt in the land of Nod, eastward of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bare Enoch,Now it happened that he was building a city, so he called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there was born to Enoch Irad, and, Irad, begat Mehujael,and Mehujael, begat Methusael,and Methusael, begat Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took to himself two wives,the name of the one, was Adah, and, the name of the second Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bare Jabal,he, was father of such as dwell in tents, and have cattle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and, the name of his brother, was Jubal,he, was father of everyone handling lyre and flute,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, as for Zillah, she also, bare Tubal-Cain, a sharpener of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron,and, the sister of Tubal-Cain, was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said Lamech to his wives, Adah and Zillah! hear ye my voice, Ye wives of Lamech! give ear to my tale, For a man, have I slain in dealing my wounds, Yea, a youth, in smiting my blows:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If, sevenfold, be, the avenging of Cain, Then, of Lamech, seventy and seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam again knew his wife, and she bare a son, and called his name Seth,For God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain slew him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Sethto him also, was born a son, and he called his name Enosh,then, was a beginning made, to call on the name of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
