And they said unto PharaohFeeders of flocks, are thy servants, both we and our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said unto PharaohTo sojourn in the land, are we come in, for there is no pasture for the flocks which pertain to thy servants, for, severe, is the famine in the land of Canaan. Now, therefore, let thy servants dwell we pray thee in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then spake Pharaoh unto Joseph saying,Thy father and thy brethren, are come in unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The land of Egypt, is, before thee, in the best of the land, cause thou thy father and thy brethren to dwell,let them dwell in the land of Goshen, And if thou knowest that there are among them men of ability, then shalt thou set them as chieftains of cattle over mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and caused him to stand before Pharaoh,and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh said unto Jacob: About how many, have been the days of the years of thy life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojournings, have been a hundred and thirty years,Few and evil, have been the days of the years of my life, neither have they attained unto the days of the years of the lives of my fathers, in the days of their sojournings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh,and came forth from the presence of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So then Joseph fixed the dwelling of his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt in the best of the land. in the land of Rameses,as Pharaoh had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren, and all his fathers house,with bread, according to the need of their little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But, bread, was there none in all the land,for the famine was, very severe,so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Joseph gathered up all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt. and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which, they, were buying,and Joseph brought the silver into the house of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the silver was spent out of the land of Egypt and out of the land of Canaan, so all the Egyptians came in unto Joseph, sayingDo give us bread, for why should we die before thee, although, silver, hath failed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Joseph: Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle,if silver hath failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they brought in their cattle unto Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses and for the cattle of the flock and for the cattle of the herd, and for the asses,and he provided them with bread for all their cattle, throughout that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When that year was ended, then came they unto him in the second year and said to himWe will not hide from my lord, how that the silver and the herds of beasts for my lord are come to an end,there is nothing left before my lord, save only our bodies and our ground:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore should we die before thine eyes both we, and our ground? Buy thou us and our ground, for bread,and we and our ground will become servants to Pharaoh, and give seed, that we may live, and not die, and the ground, not lie waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Joseph bought all the ground of the Egyptians for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine had laid fast hold upon them,so the land became Pharaohs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for the people, he brought them into bondage as servants,from one end of the boundary of Egypt unto the other end thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Only, the ground of the priests, bought he not,for the priests had a statutory-portion, from Pharaoh and they had been eating their statutory-portion, which Pharaoh had given them, for which cause, they had not sold their ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joseph said unto the people, Lo! I have bought you this day, and your ground for Pharaoh,see, here is seed for you, so shall ye sow the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and it shall come to pass that, of the yield, ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh,but the four parts, shall be your ownfor seed for the field, and for your food and for them who are in your households and for food for your little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they saidThou hast saved our lives! let us find favour in the eyes of my lord, so will we become Pharaohs servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joseph appointed it for a statuteuntil this day, regarding the ground of Egypt, that Pharaoh, should take a fifth,only, the ground of the priests, was, theirs alone, it had not become Pharaohs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the land of Goshen,and gained possessions therein, and became fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years,so it came to pass that the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the days of Israel drew near that he must die, so he called for his son for Joseph and said to himIf, I pray thee I have found favour in thine eyes, place, I pray thee thy hand under my thigh,so shalt thou deal with me in lovingkindness and faithfulnessDo not I pray thee, bury me in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When I shall lie down with my fathers, then shalt thou carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said: I, will do according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he said: Come, swear to me! And he sware to him. Then did Israel how himself down on the head of the couch.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
