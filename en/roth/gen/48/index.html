So he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And one told Jacob, and saidLo! thy son Joseph, coming in unto thee. So Israel strengthened himself, and sat up on the couch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then said Jacob unto Joseph, GOD Almighty, appeared unto me in Luz in the land of Canaan,and blessed me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and said unto meBehold me! about to make thee fruitful, so will I multiply thee, and give thee to become a multitude of peoples,so will I give this land to thy seed after thee, as an age-abiding possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now, therefore thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came in unto thee in Egypt, are Ephraim and Manasseh, like Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But thine offspring which thou hast begotten after them, thine own shall they be,after the name of their brethren, shall they be called in their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, as for me, when I came in from Padan, Rachel died by me, in the land of Canaan, in the way, while yet there was a stretch of country to come into Ephrath,so I buried her there in the way to Ephrath, the same, is Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Israel saw Josephs sons,and saidWho are these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joseph said unto his father, My sons, they are, whom God hath given me, in this place. And he saidBring them, I pray thee, unto me, that I may bless them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now, the eyes of Israel, had become dim from old age,he could not see,so he drew them near unto him, and kissed them, and embraced them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Israel said unto Joseph, To see thine own face, had I not thought,and lo! God hath caused me to see even thy seed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph brought them out from beside his knees, and bowed himself down with his face towards the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joseph took them both,Ephraim in his right hand on Israels left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand, on Israels right hand, and drew them near unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Israel put forth his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim, though, he, was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh,crossing his hands, although, Manasseh, was the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus blessed he Joseph, and said,God himselfbefore whom walked my fathers. Abraham and Isaac, God himselfwho hath been my shepherd, since I came into being until this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Messengerwho hath been my redeemer from all evilbless the lads! And may there be called upon them, my name, and the name of my fathers. Abraham and Isaac; And may they swarm into a multitude, in the midst of the earth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joseph saw that his father had laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim and it was displeasing in his eyes,so he took hold of his fathers hand to remove it from off the bead of Ephraim, on to the head of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said unto his fatherNot so, my father! for, this, is the firstborn, lay thy right hand upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And his father refused, and saidI knowmy son, I know! He also, shall become a people, and he also, shall become great,but nevertheless, his younger brother, shall become greater than he, and his seed, shall become a filling up of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he blessed them on that day, sayingIn thee, let Israel bless himself saying, God set thee as Ephraim, and as Manasseh! So he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel said unto Joseph: Lo! I, am about to die,but it shall come to pass that, God will be with you, and will take you back into the land of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But, I, have given to thee one mountain-track above thy brethren,which I took out of the hand of the Amorite, with my sword and with my bow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
