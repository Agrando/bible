O give thanks to YahwehFor he is good, For, age-abiding, is his lovingkindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let the redeemed of Yahweh say, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And, out of the lands, hath gathered themFrom the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They wandered about in the desertin a waste, Way to a city to dwell in, found they none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungryyea thirsty, their soul, within them, fainted:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then made they outcry to Yahweh, in their peril, Out of their distresses, he rescued them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And led them by a straight road, That they might journey to a city to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful dealings with the sons of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he hath satisfied the longing soul, and, the famished soul, hath he filled with good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The dwellers in darkness and death-shade, bound with oppression and iron;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because they had rebelled against the sayings of GOD,and, the counsel of the Most High, they had spurned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he bowed down, with labour, their heart, They staggered, with no one to help,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then made they outcry to Yahweh in their peril, Out of their distresses, he saved them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He brought them forth out of darkness and death-shade, and, their fetters, he tare off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful dealings with the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he brake in pieces the doors of bronze, And, the bars of iron, he hewed asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The perverse, by reason of their transgression, and on account of their iniquities, are afflicted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All manner of food, their soul abhorreth, and so they draw near unto the gates of death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then make they outcry to Yahweh in their peril, and, out of their distresses, he saveth them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sendeth his word, and healeth them, and delivereth them from their graves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful dealings with the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and recount his works with a shout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Men who go down to the sea, in ships, doing business through mighty waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They, see the works of Yahweh, and his wonders in the deep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he speaketh, and there ariseth a tempestuous wind, which lifteth on high its rolling waves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They mount the heavens, they descend the roaring deeps, their soul, by trouble, dissolveth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reel and stagger, like a drunken man, and, all their wisdom, is engulfed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then make they outcry to Yahweh in their peril, and, out of their distresses, he bringeth them forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He calmeth the storm to a whisper, and silent are their rolling waves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then are they glad, because they are hushed, And he guideth them unto their desired haven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful dealings with the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yea let them extol him in the convocation of the people, and, in the seated company of elders, let them praise him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He turneth Rivers into a desert, and, Springs of Water, into thirsty ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A Land of Fruit, into a waste of salt, For the wickedness of them who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He turneth A Desert, into a pool of water, and, A Parched Land into springs of water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And hath caused the famished to dwell there, And they have built them a city to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And have sown fields, and planted vineyards, and made them fruits of increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Thus hath he blessed them, and they have multiplied greatly, And, their cattle, he maketh not few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So have they become few and been brought low, By oppression, misfortune, and sorrow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He poureth contempt upon nobles, and causeth them to wander in a pathless waste;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But he hath set the needy on high from affliction, and made families, like a flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The upright seeth and is glad, And, all perverseness, hath closed her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Who is wise? then let him observe these things! and diligently consider the lovingkindness of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
