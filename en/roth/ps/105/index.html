to Yahweh, Call upon his Name, Make known, among the peoples, his doings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sing ye to him, Make ye music to him, Speak ye of all his wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Make your boast in his holy Name, Joyful be the heart of them who are seeking Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Search out Yahweh and his strength, Seek diligently his face at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember his wonders which he hath done, His portents, and the just decisions of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O ye Seed of Abrahamhis servants, Sons of Jacobhis chosen ones:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yahweh himself, is our God, Through all the land, are his just decision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He hath remembered, unto times age-abiding, his covenant, The word he commanded, to a thousand generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which he solemnised with Abraham, and his oath, to Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And confirmed if unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel, as a covenant age-abiding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying, To thee, will I give the land of Canaan, As your inherited portion;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While as yet they were men easily counted,A very few, and sojourners therein;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they wandered from nation to nation, From a kingdom, to another people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He suffered no son of earth to oppress them, And reprovedfor their sakes  kings!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye may not touch mine Anointed ones, And, to my Prophets, may ye do no wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then called he a famine over the and, All the staff of bread, he brake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent before them a man, For a slave, was he sold  Joseph;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They forced, into a fetter, his foot, Into the iron, entered his soul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Until the time when his word came to pass, Speech of Yahweh, proved him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king sent, and set him free, One having dominion over peoples, yet loosed he his bonds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He appointed him lord to his household, And one having dominion over all he possessed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That he might bind his rulers as he pleased, And, his elders, he might embue with wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Israel came into Egypt, And, Jacob, sojourned in the land of Ham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he made his people exceeding fruitful,And caused them to become stronger than their adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He let them turn their heartTo hate his people, To deal treacherously with his servants;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent Moses his servant, Aaron, whom he had chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He set among them his threatening signs, And his wonders, in the land of Ham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He sent darkness, and made it dark, But they rebelled against his words;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He turned their waters into blood, And so caused their fish to die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Their land swarmed with frogs, In the chambers of their kings!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He spake, and there came in the gad-fly, Gnats, in all their bounds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He made their showershail, A fire flaming throughout their land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he smote their vines, and their fig-trees, And brake in pieces the trees of their bounds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He spakethen came the swarming locust,The devouring locust, and that without number;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And devoured all the herbage in their land, And devoured the fruit of their ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then smote he every firstborn in their land, The beginning of all their strength;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus brought he them forth, with silver and gold, Nor was there, throughout his tribes, one that faltered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Egypt rejoiced when they went out, For the dread of them had fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He spread out a cloud as a covering, And fire, to give light by night,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They asked, and he brought in the quail,And, with the bread of the heavens, he satisfied them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He opened the rock, and there gushed forth waters, They flowed along, through parched places, as a river;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he remembered his holy word, With Abraham his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thus brought he forth his people with gladness,With shouts of triumph, his chosen ones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And gave them, the lands of the nations, And, of the toil of the peoples, took they possession:</span> <span class="verse"><a
