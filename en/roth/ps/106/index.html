They who observe justice, He that executeth righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O Yahweh, when thou acceptest thy people, Visit me, with thy salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That I may look upon the welfare of thy chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, That I may glory, with thine inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinnedwith our fathers, We have acted perversely, we have committed lawlessness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers, in Egypt, understood not thy wonders, They remembered not the abounding of thy lovingkindnesses, but rebelled by the seaat the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet he saved them, for the sake of his Name, to make known his mighty power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up, And he led them through deeps, as pasture-land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And saved them from the hand of one full of hatred, And redeemed them out of the hand of the foe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the waters covered their adversaries, Not one from among them, was left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They believed therefore in his words, They sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Soon forgat they his works,They waited not for his counsel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But lusted a lust in the desert, and tested GOD in the waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they became jealous of Moses in the camp,of Aaron the holy one of Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and engulfed Dathan, and covered up the assembly of Abiram;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then was kindled a fire in their assembly,a flame, consumed the lawless ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb,and bowed down to a molten image;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus changed they my glory, for the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgat GOD their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wonders in the land of Ham, Terrible things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then would he have bidden to destroy them,had not Moses his chosen, stood in the breach before him, To turn back his wrath from destroying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they refused the delightful land, They believed not his word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But murmured in their tents,They hearkened note unto the voice of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he lifted up his hand unto them, that he would let them fall in the desert;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And would disperse their seed among the nations, and would scatter them throughout the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet they let themselves be bound to Baal-peor,and did eat sacrifices to the dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they provoked to anger by their doings, and a plague, made a breach among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then stood up Phinehas, and interposed, and stayed was the plague:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So it was counted unto him, for righteousness, To generation after generation, unto times age abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they provoked by the waters of Meribah,And it fared ill with Moses, for their sakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For they embittered his spirit, and he spake rashly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They destroyed not the peoples of which Yahweh had spoken to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But had fellowship with the nations, and learned their doings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Yea they served their idols, and they became to them a snare:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to mischievous demons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, And the land was polluted with blood-shed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they became unclean by their works, and became unchaste in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then was kindled the anger of Yahweh with his people, and he abhorred his own inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So he delivered them up into the hand of the nations, And they who hated them, had dominion over them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And their enemies oppressed them, And they were bowed down under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times, did he rescue them,But, they, rebelled by their counsel, and sank low in their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then looked he on the distress which befell them,when he heard their loud cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then remembered he, for them, his covenant, and was moved to pity, according to the abounding of his lovingkindnesses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And granted them compassion before all their captors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O Yahweh our God, and gather us from among the nations, That we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, That we may triumph aloud in thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, from one age even unto another, And all the people, shall say, Amen! Praise ye Yah!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
