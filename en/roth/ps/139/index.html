O Yahweh, thou hast observed it on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behind and before, hast thou shut me in, and hast laid upon me thy hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Knowledge, too wonderful, for me! high, I cannot attain to it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whither can I go from thy spirit? or whither, from thy face, can I flee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I ascend the heavens, there, thou art!
