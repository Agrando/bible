Or provide flesh for his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, Yahweh hearkened, and became wroth,And, a fire, was kindled against Jacob, Moreover also, anger, mounted against Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because, They believed not in God, Nor trusted in his salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Though he had commanded the skies above, And, the doors of the heavens, had opened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And had rained on them manna to eat, And, the corn of the heavens, had given to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The food of the mighty, each one did eat, Nourishment, sent he them to the full;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He let loose an east wind in the heavens, Then guided he, in his might, a south wind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And rained upon them flesh as the dust, And, like the sand of the seas, birds of wing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And let them fall in the midst of their camp,Round about their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they did eat and were abundantly filled, When, what they longed for, he had brought them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They had not turned away from what they had longed for, Yet was their food in their mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When, the anger of God, mounted against them, And he slew of their vigorous youths, And, the choice young men of Israel, caused he to bow down in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this, sinned they still, And believed not in his wonders;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So he ended, in a breath, their days, And their years, in a sudden terror!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If he slew   them, then they sought him, Yea they turned, and did earnestly seek GOD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And remembered that, Elohim, was their rock, Yea, EL Most High, their Redeemer:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So they spake him fair with their mouth, And, with their tongue, did promise him falsely;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, their heart, was not fixed with him, Nor were they trusty in his covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Yet, he, full of compassion, would put a propitiatory-covering over iniquity, and not destroy,Yea, many a time, turned he back his anger, And would not stir up all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So then he remembered, That, Flesh, they were, A Wind departing, that returneth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often they, Resisted him in the desert, Vexed him, in the waste:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea they again put GOD to the test, And, to the Holy One of Israel, caused they sorrow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They remembered not his handThe day, When he ransomed them from the adversary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When he set, in Egypt, his signs, And his wonders, in the plain of Zoan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>When he turned, into blood, their Nile-streams, And, their own rivers, could they not drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent among them, The gad-fly, and it devoured them, And the frog, and it despoiled them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>When he gave to the corn-locust their produce, And their toil, to the swarming locust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He killed, with hail, their vine, And their sycomores, with frost:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When he gave up, to hail-storms, their beasts, And their cattle, to pestilent fevers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He sent among them the heat of his anger, Wrath and indignation and distress,A mission of messengers of misfortune:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He leveled a path for his anger, Withheld not, from death, their soul, But, their lifeto the pestilence, he delivered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So he smote, Every first-born in Egypt, The beginning of their strength, in the tents of Ham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he set forth, like sheep, his people, And guided them, like a flock in the desert;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Yea he led them securely, and they dreaded not, And, their enemies, the sea did cover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then brought he them within his own holy bounds, The mountain-range, which his right hand made his own:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>So he drave out, before them,   nations, And allotted them, by line, an inheritance, And caused to dwell, in their own homes, the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But they tested and resisted God Most High, And, his testimonies, did not observe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But drew back and dealt treacherously, like their fathers, They turned aside, like deceitful bowmen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And provoked him to anger with their high places, And, with their images, used to move him to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>God heard and was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So he gave up the habitation of Shiloh, The tent he had set up among Men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Yea he gave up, into captivity, his strength, And his beauty into the hand of an adversary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And delivered up, to the sword, his people, And, with his own inheritance, was he wroth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>His young men, were devoured by fire, And, his virgins, were not praised in song;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>His priests, by the sword, did fall, And, his widows, were not able to bewail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then awoke, as one that had slept, Adonay, As a warrior exulting with wine!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So he smote his adversaries in the rear, Reproach age-abiding, laid he upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Howbeit he rejected the tent of Joseph, And, the tribe of Ephraim, did not choose:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But made choice of the tribe of Judah, The mountain of Zion, which he loved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And built, like the heights, his sanctuary, Like the earth, he founded it to times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And made choice of David his servant, And took him from among the folds of the sheep:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From after the sucking ewes, he brought him in,To be shepherd to Jacob his people, And to Israel, his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he did shepherd them, according to the singleness of his heart, And, with the discernment of his hands, used he to guide them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
