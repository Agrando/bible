And, straightway, cleansed was his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus saith unto him, Mind! tell, no one,but withdraw, thyself, shew to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses directed, for a witness unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, when he entered into Capernaum, there came near unto him a centurion, beseeching him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and saying, Lord! my servant, is laid prostrate in the house, a paralytic, fearfully tortured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He saith unto him, I, will come and cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the centurion, answering, said, Lord! I am of no consideration, that, under my roof, thou shouldest enter,but, only say with a word, and healed shall be my servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, I also, am a man  set  under authority, having under myself, soldiers,and I say to this one, Go! and he goeth, and to another, Come! and he cometh, and, to my servant, Do this! and he doeth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Jesus, hearing, marveled, and said to them that followed,Verily, I say unto you, With no one in Israel, such faith as this, have I found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I say unto you, Many from east and west, will have come, and shall recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whereas, the sons of the kingdom, shall be cast forth into the darkness outside,There, will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus said unto the centurion, Withdraw! and, as thou hast believed, be it done for thee. And healed was the servant in that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus, coming into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law laid prostrate and in a fever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he touched her hand, and the fever left her,and she arose, and began ministering unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, when, evening, came, they brought unto him many demonized,and he cast out the spirits with a word, and, all who were sick, he cured:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,Himself, our weaknesses, took, and, diseases, bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Jesus, seeing a multitude about him, gave orders to depart unto the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a certain scribe, coming near, said unto him,Teacher; I will follow thee, whithersoever Thou goest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus saith unto him: The foxes, have, dens, and, the birds of the heavens, nests,but, the Son of Man, hath not where, his head he may recline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, another of the disciples, saith unto him,Lord! suffer me, first, to depart, and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But, Jesus, saith unto him,Be following me, and leave, the dead, to bury, their own dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, when he, entered, into a boat, his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And 1o! a great squall, arose in the sea, so that, the boat, was being covered, by the waves,but, he, was sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, coming near, they aroused him, saying, Master! save, we perish!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he saith unto them, Why, are ye, fearful, little of faith? Then, aroused, he rebuked the winds and the sea,and it became a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, the men, marveled, saying, Whence is this one,that, both the winds and the sea, unto him, give ear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, when he, came, unto the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him, two men demonized, out of the tombs, coming forth,fierce exceedingly, so that no one could pass that way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and lo! they cried aloud, saying, What have we in common with thee, O Son of God? Hast thou come hither, before the right time, to torment us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now there was, far from them, a herd of many swine, feeding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and, the demons, began to beseech him, saying, If thou dost cast us out, send us away, into the herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said unto them, Withdraw! So, they, going out, departed into the swine,and lo! all the herd rushed down the cliff, into the sea, and died in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, they who were feeding them, fled,and, departing into the city, reported all things, and what concerned them who had been demonized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And lo! all the city, came out to meet Jesus,and, seeing him, they besought that he would pass on from their bounds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
