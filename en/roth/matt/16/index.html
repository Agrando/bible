A snare, art thou of mine, because thou art not regarding the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then, Jesus said unto his disciplesIf any one intendeth, after me, to come, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and be following me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For, whosoever intendeth, his life, to save, shall lose it,but, whosoever shall lose his life, for my sake, shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what shall a man be profited, though, the whole world, he gain, and, his life, he forfeit?
