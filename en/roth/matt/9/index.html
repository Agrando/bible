And, arising, he followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as he was reclining in the house, that 1o! many tax-collectors and sinners, came, and were reclining together with Jesus and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, the Pharisees, observing it, began to say unto his disciples,Wherefore, with tax-collectors and sinners, doth your Teacher eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, he, hearing it, said,No need have the strong, of a physician, but they who are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But go ye, and learn what this meaneth,Mercy, I desire, and not, sacrifice; For I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then come near unto him the disciples of John, saying,Wherefore do, we, and the Pharisees, fast, whereas, thy disciples, fast not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus said unto them,Can, the sons of the bridechamber, mourn, so long as, the bridegroom, is, with them? But days will come, when the bridegroom, shall be taken from them, and, then, will they fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Howbeit, no one, layeth on a patch of unshrunk cloth, upon an old garment,for the shrinking of it teareth away from the garment, and, a worse rent, is made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither pour they new wine into old skins: otherwise at least, the skins are burst, and, the wine, runneth out, and, the skins, are spoiled,but they pour new wine into unused skins, and, both, are together preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While, these things, he was speaking unto them, lo! a  certain  ruler, came, and began bowing down to him, saying,My daughter, just now died! But come, and lay thy hand upon, her, and she shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus, arising, was following him, also his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And lo! a woman, having a flow of blood twelve years, coming near behind, touched the fringe of his mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she kept saying within herself,If only I touch his mantle, I shall be made well!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, Jesus, turning and seeing her, said,Take courage! daughter, Thy faith, hath made thee well. And the woman was made well, from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, Jesus, coming, into the house of the ruler, and seeing the flute-players and the multitude in confusion, was saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Give place! for the maiden died not, but is sleeping. And they began to deride him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, when the multitude had been put forth, he went in, and grasped her hand,and the maiden arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And forth went this report, into the whole of that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, as Jesus, was passing aside from thence, there followed him, two blind men, crying aloud and saying,Have mercy on us, O Son of David!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, when he entered the house, the blind men came unto him,and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye, that I can, do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it done unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus, sternly charged them, saying, Mind! let no one know!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They, however, going forth, made him known throughout the whole of that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, as, they, were going forth, lo! there was brought to him, a dumb man, demonized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, the demon being cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the multitudes marvelled, saying,Never, was it seen thus, in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But, the Pharisees, beg to say, In the ruler of the demons, is he casting out the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus was going round all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad-message of the kingdom,and curing every disease, and every infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But, seeing the multitudes, he was moved with compassion concerning them, because they were torn and thrown down, like sheep hating no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then, saith he unto his disciples, The harvest, indeed, is great, but, the labourers, few;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Beg ye, therefore, of the Lord of the harvest,That he would thrust forth labourers, into his harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
