How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me, here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked it; and the demon came out of him,and cured was the boy, from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, the disciples, coming near, to Jesus, privately, saidWherefore could, we, not cast it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, he, saith unto themBecause of your little faith. For, verily, I say unto youIf ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, remove hence yonder; and it shall be removed, and, nothing, shall be impossible to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>fehlt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, as they were being gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said unto themThe Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will slay him, and, on the third day, will he, arise. And they were grieved exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, when they came into Capernaum, they who, the half shekel, were receiving, came near unto Peter, and said, Your teacher, doth he not pay the half shekel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He saithYea. And, coming into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, How, to thee, doth it seem, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom receive they dues or tax? from their sons, or from the aliens?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, when he said, From the aliens, Jesus said unto him, Well then, free, are the sons!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, that we may not cause them to stumble, go unto the sea, and cast in a hook, and, the first fish that cometh up, take, and, opening its mouth, thou shalt find a shekel,that, take, and give to them for me and thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
