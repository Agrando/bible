the sower went forth to sow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and, as he sowed, some, indeed, fell by the pathway, and, the birds, came, and devoured it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, some, fell on the rocky places, where it had not much earth,and, straightway, it sprang up, because if had no depth of earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and, the sun arising, it was scorched, and, because it had no root, it withered away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, some, fell upon the thorns, and the thorns came up, and choked it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, some, fell upon the good ground, and did yield fruit,this, indeed a hundred fold, and, that, sixty, and, the other, thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He that hath ears, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the disciples, coming near, said to him, Wherefore, in parables, art thou speaking to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, he, answering, said, Because, unto you, hath it been given, to get to know the sacred secrets of the kingdom of the heavens,whereas, unto them, hath it not been given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For, whosoever hath, it shall be given, to him, and he shall be made to abound,but, whoever hath not, even what he hath, shall be taken from him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this reason, in parables, unto them, do I speak,because, seeing, they see not, and, hearing, they hear not,neither do they understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, again is being fulfilled in them, the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,They shall, surely hear, and yet will not understand, and, surely see, and yet not perceive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the heart of this people hath become dense, and, with their ears, heavily have they heard, and, their eyes, have they closed,lest, once they should see with their eyes, and, with their ears, should hear, and, with their hearts, should understand, and return; when I would certainly heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But happy are, your, eyes, that they see, and your ears, that they hear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, verily, I say unto youMany prophets and righteous men, have coveted to see what ye see, and have not seen, and to hear what ye hear, and have not heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hear, ye, then, the parable of him that sowed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, the wicked one cometh, and catcheth up that which hath been sown in his heart,this, is he, by the pathway, sown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, he on the rocky places sown, the same, is he that, heareth the word, and, straightway, with joy, receiveth it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet hath he no root in himself, but is, only for a season,and, there arising, tribulation or persecution because of the word, straightway, he findeth cause of stumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, he among the thorns sown, the same, is he that, heareth the word,and, the anxiety of the age and the deceit of riches, choke up the word, and, unfruitful, it becometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, he on the good ground sown, the same, is he who doth hear and understand the word, who, indeed, beareth fruit and produceth,this, a hundred, and, that, sixty, and, the other, thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable, put he before them, sayingThe kingdom of the heavens hath become like a man sowing good seed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and, while men were sleeping, his enemy came, and sowed over darnel, in among the wheat,and away he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, when the blade shot up, and brought forth, fruit, then, appeared, the darnel also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the servants of the householder, coming near, said to him,Sir! was it not, good seed, thou didst sow in thy field? Whence then hath it, darnel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto themAn enemy, hath, done this. And they say, unto himWilt thou, then, that we go and collect it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, he, saithNay! lest, at any time, while collecting the darnel, ye uproot, along with it, the wheat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Suffer both to grow together until the harvest, and at, harvest time, I will say unto the reapers,Collect ye first, the darnel, and bind it into bundles, with a view to the burning it up; but, the wheat, be gathering it into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable, put he before them, sayingThe kingdom of the heavens is like unto, a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>which, indeed, is, less, than all seeds, but, when grown, is greater than garden-plants, and becometh a tree,so that the birds of heaven come, and lodge among its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable,  spake he unto them :The kingdom of the heavens is like, unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until, the whole, was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things, spake Jesus in parables, unto the multitudes, and, without a parable, was he speaking, nothing, unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through the prophet, sayingI will open, in parables, my mouth, I will bring up things hidden from the foundation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then, dismissing the multitudes, he went into the house, and his disciples came near to him, sayingMake quite plain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, he, answering, saidHe that soweth the good seed, is the Son of Man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, the field, is the world, and, the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom,and, the darnel seeds, are the sons of the evil one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, the enemy that sowed them, is the adversary, and, the harvest, is, the conclusion of an age, and, the reapers, are, messengers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Just, therefore, as collected is the darnel, and, with fire is burned, so, will it be in the conclusion of the age:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of Man will send forth his messengers, and they will collect, out of his kingdom, all the causes of stumbling, and the doers of lawlessness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and will cast them into the furnace of fire: there, will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then, the righteous, will shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The kingdom of the heavens is like unto, a treasure hid in the field, which a man, finding, hid,and, by reason of his joy, withdraweth and selleth whatsoever he hath, and buyeth that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is, like, unto, a merchant, seeking beautiful pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and, finding one very precious pearl, departing, he at once sold all things, whatsoever he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto, a large drag-net, cast into the sea and gathering of every kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was filled, they dragged up on the beach, and, sitting down, collected the good into vessels, but, the worthless, forth they cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So, will it be in the conclusion of the age: The messengers will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and will cast them into the furnace of fire: there, will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And, he, said unto themWherefore, every scribe, discipled unto the kingdom of the heavens, is like unto a householder, who putteth forth out of his treasure, things new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he removed from thence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and, coming into his own city, began teaching them in their synagogue, so that with astonishment were they being struck, and were sayingWhence, hath, this one, this wisdom, and the mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not, this one, the carpenters, son? Is not, his mother, called Mary, and are not his brethrenJames and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and, his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence, then hath, this one, all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they began to find cause of stumbling in him. But, Jesus, said unto themA prophet is not without honour, save in his city, and in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not, there, many mighty works, because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
