And, Jesus, saith unto themYea: Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, hast thou prepared praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, leaving them behind, he went forth outside the city into Bethany, and spent the night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, early, returning into the city, he hungered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and, seeing one fig-tree by the way, he came up to it, and nothing, found he thereon, save leaves only,and he saith unto itNo more, from thee, let fruit spring forth, unto times age-abiding,and the fig-tree, instantly withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the disciples, seeing it, marvelled, sayingHow instantly, did the fig-tree wither away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus, answering, said unto themVerily, I say unto you, If ye have faith, and do not doubt, not only, this of the fig-tree, shall ye do,but, even if, unto this mountain, ye shall say, Be lifted up, and be cast into the sea, it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, when he, entered, the temple, the Chief-priests and the Elders of the people, came unto him as he was teaching, saying, By what authority, these things, art thou doing? and, who, to thee, gave, this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, making answer, Jesus said unto themI also, will ask, you, one thing,which if ye tell me, I also, will tell, you, by what authority, these things, I am doing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The immersion by John, whence was it? Of heaven, or of men? But, they, began to deliberate among themselves, sayingIf we say, Of heaven; He will say unto us, Wherefore then did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, if we say, Of men, we fear the multitude, for, all, as a prophet, are holding John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, making answer to Jesus, they saidWe know not. He also, said unto themNeither do, I, tell, you, by what authority, these things, I am doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But how, to you, doth it seem? A man, had two sons: coming unto the first, he said, Son! go thy way, to-day, be working in the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, he, answering, said, I, sir! and went not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, coming unto the second, he spake, in like manner,and, he, answering, said, I will not: afterwards, smitten with regret, he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two, did the will of the father? They say, The latter. Jesus saith unto themVerily, I say unto you, the tax-collectors and the harlots, are going before you, into the kingdom of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came unto you, in a way of righteousness, and ye believed him not,but, the tax-collectors and the harlots, believed him; and, ye, seeing it, were not even smitten with regret, afterwards, so as to believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable, hear ye:A man there was, a householder, who planted a vineyard, and, a wall around it, placed, and digged in it a wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen,and left home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, when the season of fruits drew near, He sent forth his servants unto the husbandmen to receive his fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the husbandmen, taking his servants, one, indeed, they beat, and, another, slew,and, another, stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, sent he forth other servants, more than the first, and they did unto them, likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Afterwards, however, he sent forth unto them his son, saying,They will pay deference unto my son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But, the husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves,This, is, the heir: Come on! Let us slay him, and have his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, taking him, they cast him forth outside the vineyard,and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When therefore the master of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say unto himMiserable men! Miserably, will he destroy them; and will let out, the vineyard, to other husbandmen, who will render unto him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus saith unto themHave ye, never, read in the Scriptures, A stone which the builders rejected, the same, hath become, head of the corner: From the Lord, hath this come to pass, and is marvellous in our eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Wherefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God, will be taken away from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, he that falleth on this stone, will be sorely bruised; but, on whomsoever it may fall, it will utterly destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the Chief-priests and the Pharisees, hearing his parables, took note, that, concerning them, he was speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And, seeking to secure him, they feared the multitudes; since, for a prophet, were they holding him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
