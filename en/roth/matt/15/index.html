Whatsoever, out of me, thou mightest be profited,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in nowise, shall honour his father or his motherand so ye have cancelled, the word of God, for the sake of your, tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hypocrites! well prophesied concerning you, Isaiah, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people, with the lips, do, honour, me, while, their heart, far off, holdeth from me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But, in vain, do they pay devotions unto me, teaching, for teachings, the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, calling near the multitude, he said to themHear and understand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that which entereth into the mouth, defileth the man, but, that which proceedeth out of the mouth, the same, defileth the man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then, coming near, his disciples say unto himKnowest thou, that the Pharisees, hearing the word, were caused to stumble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, he, answering, saidEvery plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, will be uprooted:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone! they are, blind leaders; and, if the, blind, lead the, blind, both, into a ditch, will fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Peter, answering, said unto him, Declare to us the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, he, said, To this moment, are, ye also, without discernment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Perceive ye not that, every thing which entereth into the mouth, into the stomach, findeth way, and, into the draught, is passed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>while, the things which proceed out of the mouth, out of the heart, come forth, and, they, defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, out of the heart, come forth wicked designs,murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, profane speakings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>these, are the things which defile the man, but, the eating with unwashed hands, doth not defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, going forth from thence, Jesus retired into the parts of Tyre and Zidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And lo! a Canaanite woman, from those bounds, coming forth, began crying out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter, is miserably demonized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, he, answered her no a word. And his disciples, coming forward began requesting him, sayingDismiss her, because she is crying out after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, he, answering, said, I was not sent forth, save unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, she, coming, began bowing down to him, saying, Lord! help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, he, answering, said, It is, not seemly, to take the loaf of, the children, and cast, to the little dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, she, said, True, Lord!  for , even the little dogs, eat of the crumbs which are falling from the table of, their masters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then, answering, Jesus said to herO woman! great, is, thy faith! Be it, done, for thee, as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed, from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, passing on from thence, Jesus came near the sea of Galilee, and, going up into the mountain, was sitting there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there came unto him large multitudes, having with themselves the lame, the maimed, the blind, the dumb, and many others,and they cast them near his feet, and he cured them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that the multitude marvelled, seeing the dumb speaking, the lame walking, and the blind seeing,and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But, Jesus, calling near his disciples, saidMy compassions are moved towards the multitude, because  even now , three days, abide they with me, and they have nothing to eat,and, to dismiss them fasting, I am not willing, lest by any means they faint in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his disciples say unto himWhence, to us, in a wilderness, loaves in such numbers as to fill a multitude, so great?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus saith unto themHow many, loaves have ye? And, they, said,Seven, and a few small fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, sending word to the multitude to recline upon the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>he took the seven loaves, and the fishes, and, giving thanks, brake,and began giving to his disciples, and, the disciples, to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all did eat and were filled,and, the remainder of the broken pieces, took they up, seven hampers, full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, they who did eat, were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, dismissing the multitudes, he went up into the boat,and came into the bounds of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
