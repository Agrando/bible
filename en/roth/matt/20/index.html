And, again, going forth about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, about the eleventh, going forth, he found others, standing, and saith unto themWhy, here, stand ye, all the day, unemployed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say unto himBecause, no one, hath hired, us. He saith unto themYe also, go your way into the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, when evening came, the master of the vineyard saith unto his stewardCall the labourers, and pay the hire,beginning from the last, unto the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they of the eleventh hour, coming, received severally a denary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, when the first came, they supposed that, more, they should receive,and, they also, received severally a denary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, having received it, they began to murmur against the householder, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>These last, one hour, wrought, and thou hast made them, equal unto us, who have borne the burden of the day, and the scorching heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, he, answering, unto one of them, said,Friend! I wrong thee not: Was it not, for a denary, thou didst agree with me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take thine own, and go thy way; but I please, unto this last, to give, as also to thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Is it not allowed me to do, what I please, with my own? or is, thine eye, evil, because I good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus, shall beThe last first, and the first last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, Jesus, being about to go up unto Jerusalem, took unto him the twelve  disciples , apart, and, in the way, he said unto them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lo! we are going up unto Jerusalem; and, the Son of Man, will be delivered up unto the chief-priests and Scribes, and they will condemn him,  to death ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And deliver him up unto the nations, to mock and to scourge and to crucify,and, on the third day, he will, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came unto him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing down, and asking something from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, he, said to herWhat desirest thou? She saith unto himBid, that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus, answering, saidYe know not what ye are asking: Are ye able to drink the cup, which, I, am about to drink; They say unto himWe are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He saith unto themMy cup, indeed, ye shall drink; but, to sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give,except unto those for whom it hath been prepared by my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the ten, hearing, were sorely displeased, concerning the two brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, Jesus, calling them near, saidYe know that, the rulers of the nations, lord it over them, and, the great ones, wield authority over them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Not so, is it, among you,but, whosoever shall desire, among you, to become, great, shall be, your minister;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, whosoever shall desire, among you, to be first, shall be, your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Just as, the Son of Man, came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom instead of many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, as they were going forth from Jericho, there followed him a great multitude;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and lo! two blind men, sitting beside the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried aloud sayingLord! have mercy on us! Son of David!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the multitude rebuked them, that they might hold their peace. But, they, the more, cried aloud, sayingLord, have mercy on us! Son of David!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, standing still, Jesus called them, and saidWhat desire ye I should do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They say unto himLord! that, our eyes, may open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes,and, straightway, they recovered sight, and followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
