So that it is allowable, on the sabbath, nobly, to act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then saith he unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand! And he stretched it forth,and it was restored, whole, as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees, going forth, took, counsel, against him, to the end that, him, they might destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, Jesus, taking note, retired from thence,and many followed him, and he cured them all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and straitly charged them, lest they should make him, manifest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lo! my servant, whom I have chosen, My beloved, in whom, my soul, delighteth,I will put my Spirit upon him, and, justice, unto the nations, will he report:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will not strive, nor will he cry out, nor shall any hear, in the broadways, his voice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised cane, will he not break, and, a smoking wick, will he not quench,until he urge on, justice, to victory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, in his name, shall nations hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then they brought unto him, one demonized, blind and dumb,and he cured him, so that the dumb did speak and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the multitudes were beside themselves, and were saying, Can, this one, be, the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, the Pharisees, hearing it, said, This one, doth not cast out the demons, save in Beelzebul ruler of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, knowing their inward thoughts, he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself, is laid waste,and, no city or house divided against itself, will stand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, if, Satan, is casting, Satan, out, against himself, hath he become divided,How then shall, his kingdom, stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, if, I, in Beelzebul, am casting out the demons, In whom are, your sons, casting them out? Wherefore, they, shall be, judges of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, if, in Gods Spirit, I, am casting out the demons, then doubtless hath come upon you unawares, the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or how can one enter the house of the mighty and, seize his goods, unless, first, he bind the mighty one? and, then, his house, he will plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He that is no with me, is, against me,and, he that gathereth not with me, scattereth</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Wherefore, I say unto you, All sin and profane speaking, shall be forgiven unto men,but, the speaking profanely of the Spirit, shall not be forgiven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him,but, whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age, or the coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree worthless, and its fruit worthless; for, from the fruit, the tree is known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Broods of vipers! How can ye speak, good things, being, evil? For, out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The good man, out of the good treasure, putteth forth, good things; and, the evil man, out of the evil treasure, putteth forth, evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I say unto you, That, every useless expression that men shall utter, they shall render, concerning it, an account, in a day of judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For, by thy words, shalt thou be, justified, and, by thy words, shalt thou be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then, answered him, certain of the Scribes and Pharisees, saying, Teacher! we desire of thee, a sign, to behold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But, he, answering, said unto them, A wicked and adulterous generation, a sign, doth seek, and, a sign, will not be, given, it, save the sign of Jonah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For, just as was Jonah in the belly of the sea-monster three days and three nights, so, will be the Son of Man, in the heart of the earth, three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Men of Nineveh, will rise up in the judgment, with this generation, and will condemn it,because they repented into the proclamation of Jonah; and lo! something greater than Jonah, here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south, will arise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn itbecause she came out of the ends of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo! something greater than Solomon, here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But, when the impure spirit goeth out of the man, it passeth through waterless places, seeking rest,and findeth it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then, it saith, Into my house, will I return whence I came out,and, coming, findeth it empty  and  swept and adorned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then, it goeth, and taketh along with itself, seven diverse spirits, more wicked than itself,and, entering, abideth there; and, the last state of that man, becometh, worse than the first. So, shall it be, with this, wicked, generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While yet he was speaking unto the multitudes, lo! his mother and brethren, were standing without, seeking to speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And one said to him, Lo! thy mother and thy brethren, without, are standing, seeking, to speak, with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But, he, answering, said unto him that was telling him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And, stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said, Lo! my mother and my brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For, whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he, is my, brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
