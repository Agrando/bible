For I know that, Jesus the crucified, ye are seeking:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here, for he hath arisen, as he said. Come! see the place where he lay;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, quickly going, tell his disciplesHe hath arisen from the dead, and lo! he is going before you into Galilee;There, shall ye yourselves see him: Lo! I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, departing quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring tidings unto his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And lo! Jesus, met them, sayingJoy to you! And, they, going forward, held his feet, and worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then, Jesus saith unto themBe not afraid! Go your way, bear tidings unto my brethren, that they may depart into Galilee; and, there, shall they themselves see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now as they were, going, 1o! certain of the guard, went into the city and reported unto the High-priests all the things that had come to pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and, being gathered together with the Elders and taking counsel, sufficient pieces of silver, gave they unto the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>sayingSay ye, His disciples, coming, by night, stole him, while we were sleeping;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, if this be reported unto the governor, we, will persuade him, and will make, you, free from care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, they, taking the pieces of silver, did as they were instructed. And this account was spread abroad among the Jewsuntil this  very  day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, the eleven disciples, went into Galilee, unto the mountain which, Jesus, had appointed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and, seeing him, they worshipped, but, some, doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus, coming near, spake unto them, sayingAll authority, in heaven and on earth, hath been given unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go ye, therefore, and disciple all the nations, Immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I myself have commanded you, And lo! I, am, with you, all the days, until the conclusion of the age.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
