And they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, from that time, was he seeking a favourable opportunity that he might, deliver him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, on the first of the days of unleavened bread, the disciples came unto Jesus, sayingWhere wilt thou, that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, he, saidGo your way into the city, unto such-a-one, and say to him, The teacher, saith, My season, is, near, with thee, will I keep the passover, with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did, as Jesus directed them, and made ready the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, when, evening, came, he was reclining with the twelve  disciples ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and, as they were eating, he saidVerily, I say unto you, One from among you, will deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, being exceedingly grieved, they began to be saying to him, each oneCan it be, I, Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, he, answering, saidHe who hath dipped with me his hand in the bowl, the same, will deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of Man, indeed, goeth his way, according as it is written concerning him,But alas! for that man, through whom the Son of Man, is being delivered up: Well, had it been for him, if, that man, had not been born!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Judas, who was delivering him up, answering, saidCan it be, I, Rabbi? He saith unto himThou, hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, as they were eating, Jesus, taking a loaf and blessing, brake,and, giving to his disciples, saidTake, eat! This, is, my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, taking a cup, and giving thanks, he gave unto them, sayingDrink of it, all of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For, this, is my blood of the covenant, which, for many, is to be poured out, for remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moreover, I say unto youIn nowise, will I drink, henceforth, of this produce of the vine, until that day, whensoever I shall drink it with you, new, in the kingdom of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, having sung praise, they went forth unto the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then, Jesus saith unto themAll ye, will find cause of stumbling in me, during this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and, the sheep of the flock, will be scattered abroad;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But, after my arising, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now Peter, answering, said unto himThough, all, shall find cause of stumbling in thee, I, shall never find cause of stumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus saith unto him: Verily, I say unto theeDuring this night, before a cock crow, Thrice, wilt thou deny me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter saith unto him: Even though it be needful for me, with thee to die, in nowise, will I deny thee. Likewise, all the disciples also, said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus cometh with them, into a place called Gethsemane,and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, taking with him, Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved and to be in great distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then, saith he unto them: Encompassed with grief, is my soul, unto death: Abide ye here, and be watching with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, going forward a little, he fell upon his face, offering prayer, and sayingMy Father! If it is possible, let this cup pass from me,Nevertheless, not as, I, will, but as, thou, wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he cometh unto his disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and said unto PeterThus, powerless are ye, one hour, to watch with me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Be watching and praying, that ye may not enter into temptation: The spirit, indeed, is, eager, but, the flesh, weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again, a second time, departing he prayed, saying: My Father! If it is impossible for this to pass, except I, drink, it, Accomplished, be, thy will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And coming, he, again, found them sleeping, for their eyes had become heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, leaving them, he, again, departed, and prayed a third time, the same word, saying again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then, cometh he unto the disciples, and saith unto them,Ye are sleeping what time remaineth, and taking your rest: Lo! the hour hath drawn near, and, the Son of Man, is being delivered up into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Arise! let us be going,Lo! he that delivereth me up, hath drawn near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, while, yet, he was speaking, lo! Judas, one of the twelve, came, and, with him, a large multitude, with swords and clubs, from the High-priests and Elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And, he who was delivering him up, gave them a sign, sayingWhomsoever I shall kiss, he, it is,secure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And, straightway, coming unto Jesus, he saidJoy to thee! Rabbi, and eagerly kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But, Jesus, said unto himFriend! wherefore art thou here? Then, coming forward, they thrust their hands upon Jesus, and secured him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And lo! one of those with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, grasped his sword, and smiting the servant of the High-priest, cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then, Jesus saith unto himPut back thy sword into its place, for, all they who take a sword, by a sword, shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Or thinkest thou that I cannot call upon my Father, and he will set near me, even now, more than twelve legions of messengers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that, thus, it must needs come to pass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour, said Jesus unto the multitudes: As against a robber, came ye forth, with swords and clubs, to arrest me? Daily in the temple, used I to sit teaching, and ye secured me not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But, this, hath, wholly, come to pass, that, the Scriptures of the prophets, may be fulfilled. Then, the disciples, all forsaking him, fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And, they who secured Jesus, led him away unto Caiaphas the High-priest, where the Scribes and the Elders gathered themselves together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Now, Peter, was following him afar off, unto the court of the High-priest,and, entering within, was sitting with the attendants, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now, the High-priests and all the High-council, were seeking false-witness against Jesus, that they might, put him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and found not any, though many came forward as false-witnesses. At length, however, there came forward, two,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said: This, man saidI am able to pull down the shrine of God, and, in three days, to, build, it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the High-priest, arising, said unto himNothing, answerest thou? What are these, against thee bearing witness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But, Jesus, was silent. And, the High-priest, said unto him: I put thee on oath, by the Living God, that, to us, thou sayWhether, thou, art the Christ, the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus saith unto him: Thou, hast said; Moreover, I say unto youHereafter, ye will see the Son of Man, sitting on the right hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then, the High-priest rent asunder his garments, sayingHe hath spoken profanely! What further need have we, of witnesses? Lo! now, ye have heard the profanity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>How, to you, doth it seem? And, they, answering, said: Guilty of death, he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then, spat they into his face, and buffeted him; and, others, struck him smartly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>sayingProphesy unto us, O Christ! Who is he that struck thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now, Peter, was sitting without, in the court; and there came unto him a certain female servant, sayingThou also, wast with Jesus, the Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But, he, denied before all, sayingI know not what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And, when he went out into the porch, another female saw him, and said unto them who were thereThis, one was with Jesus the Nazarene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And, again, he denied, with an oathI know not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And, after a little, the by-standers, coming forward, said unto Peter: Truly, thou also, art, from among them, for, thy very speech, maketh thee, manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then, began he to be cursing and swearingI know not the man! And, straightway, a cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter was put in mind of the declaration of Jesus, of his having saidBefore a cock crow, thrice, wilt thou utterly deny me; and, going forth outside, he wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
