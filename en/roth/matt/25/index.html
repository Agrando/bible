Be going forth to meet him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then, arose all those virgins, and trimmed their torches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, the foolish, unto the prudent, saidGive us of your oil, because, our torches, are going out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the prudent, answered, sayingLest once, by any means, there be not enough for us and you, be going rather unto them that sell, and buy for yourselves</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and, they who were ready, went in with him, into the marriage-feast, and, the door was locked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, afterwards, came the other virgins also, sayingLord!

Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I hungered, and ye gave me to eat, I thirsted, and ye gave me drink, a stranger, was I, and ye took me home,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Naked, and ye clothed me, sick, and ye visited me, in prison, was I, and ye came unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then, will the righteous answer him, saying: Lord! when, saw we theehungry, and fed thee, or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, when, saw we theea stranger, and took thee home, or naked, and clothed thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, when, saw we theesick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And, answering, the king will say unto them: Verily, I say unto youInasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my least brethren, unto me, ye did it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then, will he say unto those also, on his left hand: Depart ye from me, accursed ones! Into the age-abiding fire, which hath been prepared for the adversary and his messengers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I hungered, and ye gave me not to eat,  and  I was thirsty, and ye gave me not to drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>A stranger, was I, and ye took me not home, naked, and ye clothed me not, sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then, will, they also, answer, saying: Lord! when saw we theehungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and ministered not unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then, will he answer them, saying: Verily, I say unto youInasmuch as ye did it not, unto one of these least, neither unto me, did ye it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And, these, shall go away, into, age-abiding, correction, but, the righteous, into, age-abiding, life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
