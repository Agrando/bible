Verily, I say unto you, they are getting back their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But, thou, when thou wouldest pray, enter into thy closet, and, fastening thy door, pray unto thy Father who is in secret,and, thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, being at prayer, use not vain repetitions, just like the nations,for they think, that, in their much speaking, they shall be hoard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>do not, therefore, make yourselves like them, for  God  your Father knoweth of what things ye have, need, before ye ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus, therefore pray, ye: Our Father, who art in the heavens,Hallowed be thy name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Come may thy kingdom,Accomplished be thy will, as in heaven, also on earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Our needful bread, give us, this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our debts, as, we also, have forgiven our debtors;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And bring us not into temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, if ye forgive men their faults, Your Father who is in the heavens, will forgive, even you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, if ye forgive not men  their faults , neither will your Father forgive, your faults.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, when ye may he fasting, become not ye, as the hypocrites, of sullen countenance,for they darken their looks, that they may appear, unto men, to be fasting: Verily, I say unto you, they are getting back their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, when, thou, art fasting, anoint thy head, and, thy face, wash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that thou do not appear, unto men, to be fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret,and, thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Be not laying up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where, moth and rust, do tarnish, and where, thieves, dig through and steal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but be laying up or yourselves treasures in heaven, where, neither moth nor rust, doth tarnish, and where, thieves, dig not through nor steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for, where, thy treasure, is, there, will be, thy heart  also .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The lamp of the body, is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body, shall be, lighted up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, if thine eye be, evil, thy whole body, shall be, in the dark;if therefore, the light which is in thee, is, darkness, the darkness, how great!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No one, unto two masters, can be in service; for either, the one, he will hate, and, the other ,love, or, one, he will hold to, and, the other, despise: Ye cannot be in service, unto God, and, unto Riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this cause, I say unto you: Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat  or what ye shall drink ,or for your body, what ye shall put on: Is not, the life, more than, the food? And, the body, than, the raiment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Observe intently, the birds of the heaven,that they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and yet, your heavenly Father, feedeth, them: Are no, ye, much better than, they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But who from among you, being anxious, can add to his stature one cubit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, about clothing, why are ye anxious? Consider well the lilies of the field, how they grow,they toil not neither do they spin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And yet, I say unto you, not even Solomon, in all his glory, was arrayed like, one of these!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now, if the grass of the fieldwhich to-day, is, and, to-morrow, into an oven, is castGod thus adorneth, not much rather, you, little of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do not then be anxious saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or Wherewithal shall we be arrayed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For, all these things, the nations, seek after,for your heavenly Father, knoweth, that ye are needing, all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But be seeking first, the kingdom and its righteousness,and, all these things, shall be added unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Do not, then, be anxious for the morrow; for the morrow, will be anxious, for itself: Sufficient for the day, is the evil thereof.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
