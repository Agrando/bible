A reed, by a wind, shaken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what went ye forth to see? A man, in soft clothing, arrayed? Lo! they who soft clothing do wear, are in the houses of kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But why went ye forth? A prophet, to see? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This, is he, concerning whom it is written,Lo! I, send my messenger before thy face, who shall make ready thy way before thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily, I say unto youThere hath not arisen, among such as are born of women, a greater than John the Immerser,yet, he that is less in the kingdom of the heavens, is, greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, from the days the Immerser, until even now, the kingdom of the heavens, is being invaded, and, invaders, are, seizing upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, all the prophets and the law, until John, did prophesy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, if ye are willing to accept it, he, is Elijahthe one destined to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that hath ears, let him hear!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, unto what, shall I liken this generation? It is, like, unto children, sitting the market-places, who, calling unto the others,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>say, We played the flute to you, and ye danced not,we sang a lament, and ye beat not the breast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, John, came, neither eating nor drinking, and they sayA demon, he hath!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man, came, eating and drinking, and they say, Lo! a gluttonous man and a wine-drinker! a friend of, tax-collectors, and sinners! And yet wisdom hath been justified by her works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then, began he to upbraid the cities, in which had been done his noblest mighty works; because they repented not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! Because, if, in Tyre and Zidon, had been done the works of power, which were done in you, of old, in sackcloth and ashes, had they repented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover, I say unto you, For Tyre and Zidon, more tolerable, will it be, in the day of judgment, than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, thou, Capernaum! Unto heaven, shalt thou be uplifted? Unto hades, thou shall be brought down; because, if, in Sodom, had been done the works of power, which were done in thee, it would, in that case, have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Moreover, I say unto youFor the land of Sodom, more tolerable, will it be in a day of judgment, than, for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In that season, answered Jesus, and saidI openly give praise unto thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,in that thou hast hid these things from the wise and discerning, and hast revealed them unto babes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yea, O Father! That, so, it hath become, a delight, before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things, unto me, have been delivered up by my Father; and, no one, fully knoweth the Son, save the rather, neither doth any one fully know, the Father, save, the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son, may be minded, to reveal, him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come unto me! all ye that toil and are burdened, and, I, will give you rest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me,because, meek, am I and lowly, in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For, my yoke, is easy, and, my burden, light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
