If a certain man come to have a hundred sheep and one from among them go astray, Will he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains, and going, seek the straying one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, if it should be that he find it, Verily, I say unto youHe rejoiceth over it, more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus, there is no desire, in the presence of my Father who is in the heavens, that, one of these little ones, should be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, if thy brother sin, withdraw, convince him, betwixt thee and him, alone,If unto thee he hearken, thou hast gained thy brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, if he do not hearken, take with thee, yet one or two, that, at the mouth of two witnesses or three, every declaration, maybe established;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, if he hear them amiss, tell it to the assembly,And, if, even the assembly, he hear amiss, Let him be unto thee, just as the man of the nations and the tax-collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Verily, I say unto youWhatsoever things ye shall bind on the earth, shall be bound in heaven; and, whatsoever things ye shall loose on the earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Again,  verily  I say unto youIf two from among you shall agree upon the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be brought to pass for them, from my Father who is in the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, where there are two or three, gathered together into my name, there, am I, in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then, coming near, Peter said  to him Lord! how many times, shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until, seven, times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus saith to himI say not unto thee, unto, seven, times, but, until seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For this cause, hath the kingdom of the heavens become like unto a man, a king, who wished to settle an account with his servants;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, when he, began, to settle, there was brought unto him a, certain, debtor, of a thousand talents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and, he, not having, wherewith to pay, the master ordered him to be sold, and the wife, and the children, and whatsoever he had,and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The servant therefore, falling down, began to do homage unto him, sayingHave patience with me, and, all, will I pay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, moved with compassion, the master of that servant released him, and, the loan, he, forgave, him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But that servant, going out, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him, a hundred denaries, and, laying hold of him, he began seizing him by the throat, saying, Pay! if anything thou owest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>His fellow servant, therefore, falling down, began beseeching him, saying, Have patience with me! And I will pay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He, however, would not, but went away and cast him into prison,until he should pay what was owing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>His fellow-servants, therefore, seeing, the things that were done, were grieved exceedingly,and went and made quite plain to their master all the things which had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then, calling him near, his master saith unto himO wicked servant! All that debt, forgave I thee, because thou didst beseech me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Was it not binding, upon thee also, to have mercy upon thy fellow-servant, as, I also, on thee, had mercy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, provoked to anger, his master delivered him up to the torturers, until he should pay all that was owing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Thus, my heavenly Father also, will do unto you, if ye forgive not each one his brother, from your hearts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
