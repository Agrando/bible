And, he, was put to silence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then, the king said unto the ministers, Binding him feet and hands, cast him forth into the darkness, outside: There, shall be wafting and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, many, are called, but, few, chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then, went the Pharisees and took, counsel, that they might ensnare him, in discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent forth to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher! we know that, true, thou art, and, the way of God, in truth, dost teach, and it concerneth thee not about anyone,for thou lookest not unto the face of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us then, how, to thee, it seemeth? Is it allowable to give tax unto Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus, taking note of their wickedness, saidWhy are ye tempting me, hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Shew me the coin appointed for the tax. And, they, brought unto him a denary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he saith unto themWhose, is this image and the inscription?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They sayCaesars. Then, saith he unto themRender, therefore, the things of Caesar, unto Caesar,and, the things of God, unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, hearing, they marvelled,and, leaving him, departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On that day, there came unto him Sadducees, who say, there is, no resurrectionand they questioned him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>sayingTeacher! Moses, said, If any man die not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were, with us, seven brethren; and, the first, marrying, died, and not having seed, left his wife unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise, the second also, and the third,unto the seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, last of all, died, the wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In the resurrection, therefore,Of which of the seven, shall she be wife? For, all, had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answering, saidYe are deceiving yourselves, knowing neither the Scriptures, nor yet the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For, in the resurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but, as messengers in the heaven, are they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But, as touching the resurrection of the deadHave ye not read what was spoken unto you by God, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I, am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?He is not God, of the dead, but, of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, the multitudes, hearing, were being struck with astonishment at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now, the Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, were brought together with one accord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and one from among them, a lawyer, proposed a question, putting him to the test:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Teacher! which commandment, is greatest in the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, he, said unto himThou shalt love the Lord thy Godwith all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This, is the great and first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The second, like it, is, this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>In these two commandments, all the law, is contained, and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now, the Pharisees having come together, Jesus questioned them, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>How, to you, doth it seem, concerning the Christ? Whose son, is he? They say unto himDavids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He saith unto themHow then doth, David, in spirit, call him, Lord, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The Lord, hath said unto, my Lord,Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If then, David, calleth him, Lord, How, is he, his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And, no one, was able to answer him a word, neither durst anyone, from that day, question him, any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
