But, they, saidWhat is that to us? thou, shalt see to it for thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, throwing the pieces of silver into the Temple, he withdrew, and, going away, hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But, the High-priests, taking the pieces of silver, saidIt is not allowed, to cast them into the treasury; since, a price of blood, they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, taking counsel, they bought with them, the field of the potter, as a burial-place for strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wherefore, that field hath been called Field of Blood, until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then, was fulfilled, that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, as the value of him whom they had valued, whom they had valued, of Israels sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And gave them for the field of the potter, as, the Lord, directed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, Jesus, stood before the governor; and the governor questioned him, sayingThou, art the king of the Jews? And, Jesus, saidThou, sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, while he was being accused by the High-priests and Elders, he answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then, Pilate saith unto himHearest thou not how many things against thee they are bearing witness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he answered him, no not so much as a single word, so that the governor was marvelling exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, feast by feast, the governor had been wont to release one unto the multitude, a prisoner whom they were desiring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now they had at that time a distinguished prisoner, called, Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They therefore having come together, Pilate, said to themWhom will ye I should release unto you? Barabbas? or Jesus, who is called Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he knew that, for envy, they had delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, as he was sitting upon the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man, for, many things, have I suffered this day, by dream, because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, the High-priests and the elders, persuaded the multitudes, that they should claim Barabbas, but, Jesus, should, destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now the governor, answering, said unto themWhich of the two desire ye I should release unto you? And they saidBarabbas!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate saith unto themWhat then shall I do unto Jesus, who is called Christ? They all sayLet him be crucified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, he, saidIndeed! what evil hath he done? But, they, vehemently, were crying aloud, sayingLet him be crucified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate, seeing, that, nothing, it availed, but rather, a tumult, was arising, taking water, washed his hands of it before the multitude, sayingInnocent, am I, of the blood of this man,Ye, shall see to it for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the people, answering, saidHis blood be upon us and upon our children!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then released he unto them Barabbas, but, scourging, Jesus, delivered him up, that he might be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the soldiers of the governor, taking Jesus aside into the judgment-hall, gathered unto him all the band;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and, unclothing him, a scarlet scarf, put they about him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and, plaiting a crown out of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand,and, kneeling before him, began to mock him, sayingJoy to thee, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, spitting upon him, they took the reed, and began striking upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, when they had mocked him, they put off him the scarf, and put on him his garments, and led him away unto the crucifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, as they were going forth, they found a man of Cyrene, by name, Simon,the same, they impressed to bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, coming into a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Skull-place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they gave him to drink, wine, with gall, mingled, and, tasting, he would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, having crucified him, they parted among themselves his garments, casting a cloth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and, being seated, were watching him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they put up, over his head, his accusation, writtenTHIS, IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then, are crucified with him, two robbers,one on the right hand, and one on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, they who were passing by, were reviling him, shaking their heads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and sayingThe man that taketh down the Temple and in three days buildeth it! Save, thyself! If thou art Gods, Son, come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Likewise, the High-priests,  also , mocking, with the Scribes and Elders, were saying: Others, he saved,Himself, he cannot save:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Israels King, he is! Let him come down, now, from the cross,and we will believe on him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He hath put confidence upon God, Let him rescue him, now, if he desireth him; for he said, I am, Gods Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, the same thing, the robbers also, who were crucified with him, were casting in his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now, from the sixth hour, darkness, came upon all the landuntil the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And, about the ninth hour, Jesus uttered a cry, with a loud voice, sayingEloi! Eloi! lema sabachthanei? that is, My God! my God! to what end hast thou forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now certain of them who were there standing, when they heard, began to sayThis man, calleth, Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And, straightway, one from among them, running, and taking a sponge, and filling it with vinegar and putting it on a reed, was giving him to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>but, the rest, saidStay! let us see whether Elijah is coming, and will save him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And, Jesus, again crying out with a loud voice, dismissed the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And lo! the veil of the Temple, was rent, from top to bottom, into two; and, the earth, was shaken, and, the rocks, were rent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and, the tombs, were opened and, many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep, arose,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and, coming forth out of the tombs after his arising, entered into, the holy city, and plainly appeared unto many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now, the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things coming to pass, were violently affrighted, sayingTruly, Gods Son, was, he!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now there were there, many women, from afar, beholding, who indeed had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>among whom was Mary the Magdalene, also Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And, when, evening, arrived, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, whose name was Joseph, who also, himself, had been discipled unto Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>The same, going unto Pilate, claimed the body of Jesus. Then, Pilate commanded it to be given up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And Joseph, taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean Indian-cloth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and laid it in his new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock, and, rolling near a large stone unto the door of the tomb, departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Now there were there, Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And, on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the High-priests and the Pharisee were gathered together unto Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>sayingSir! we have been put in mind that, that deceiver, said, while yet living,After three days, will I, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Command, therefore, that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day,lest once the disciples should come and steal him, and say unto the people, He hath arisen from the dead! and, the last deception, shall be, worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate saith unto themYe have a guard: Go your way, secure it for yourselves, as ye know how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And, they, went and secured for themselves the sepulchre, sealing the stone, with the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
