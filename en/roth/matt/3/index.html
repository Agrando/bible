In the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight, be making his paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But John, himself, had his raiment of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins,while, his food, was locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then, were going forth unto himJerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round about the Jordan:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and were being immersed in the Jordan river, by him, openly confessing their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, seeing, many of the Pharisees and Sadducees, coming unto his immersion, he said to them,Broods of vipers! who suggested to you, to be fleeing from the coming wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bring forth, therefore, fruit worthy of repentance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and think not to be saying within yourselves,As our father, we have, Abraham; for, I say unto you, that God is able, out of these stones, to raise up children unto Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Already also, the axe, unto the root of the trees, is being laid,every tree, therefore, not bringing forth good fruit, is to be hewn down, and, into fire, to be cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I, indeed, am immersing you, in water, unto repentance,but, he who, after me, cometh is, mightier than I, whose, sandals, I am not worthy to bear, he, will immerse you, in Holy Spirit and fire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will clear out his threshing-floor,and will gather his wheat into the granary, but, the chaff, will he burn up with fire unquenchable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then, cometh Jesus, from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John,to be immersed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, he, would have hindered him, sayingI, have, need, by thee, to be immersed,and dost, thou, come unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus answering, said unto him, Suffer   even now,for, thus, it becometh us, to fulfil, all righteousness; then, he suffered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus, having been immersed, straightway, went up from the water,and lo! the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God, descending like a dove coming upon him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and lo! a voice out of the heavens,saying, This, is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
