Five loaves, give thou into my hand,or, whatever can be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand,but, hallowed bread, there is, if the young men have kept themselves, at least from women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David answered the priest and said to himOf a truth, women, have been withheld from us, of late, through my coming out, and the wallets of the young men have become hallowed,while   to be hallowed, in the vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the priest gave him hallowed   ,because there was there no bread, save the Presence-Bread, which had to be removed from before Yahweh, to put hot bread, on the day when it should be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, in that very place, was a man of the servants of Saul, on that day, detained before Yahweh, whose name, was Doeg the Edomite,chief of the shepherds that belonged unto Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said David to Ahimelech, See whether there is here, under thy hand, a spear or a sword? for, neither my sword, nor my other weapons, did I take in my hand, for, the kings business, was, urgent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the priest said: The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou didst smite in the vale of Elah, lo! that, is wrapped up in a cloth, behind the ephod, if, that, thou wilt take to thee, take it, for there is no other, save that, here.
