Let us fetch unto us, out of Shiloh, the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that, when it cometh into our midst, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the people sent to Shiloh, and bare from thence the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts, who inhabiteth the cherubim,and, there, were the two sons of Eli, with the ark of the covenant of God, namely, Hophni and Phinehas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And so it was, when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, that all Israel brake out into a loud shout of joy,so that the earth rang again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they saidWhat meaneth the noise of this loud shout of joy in the camp of the Hebrews? And they learned that, the ark of Yahweh, had come into the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Philistines were afraid, for they saidGod hath come into the camp. And they saidWoe to us! for there hath not happened the like of this, heretofore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Woe to us! Who shall rescue us out of the hand of these majestic gods? These, are the gods, who smote the Egyptians with all manner of smiting in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Take courage, and quit yourselves like men, ye Philistines, lest ye come into bondage to the Hebrews, as they have been in bondage unto you,therefore must ye quit yourselves like men, and fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his home; and the slaughter became exceeding great,and there fell of Israelthirty thousand footmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, the ark of God, was taken,and, the two sons of Eli, were slain, Hophni and Phinehas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and entered Shiloh on the same day,with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, when he entered, lo! Eli was sitting upon his chair, by the wayside, watching, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God,and, the man, entered to tell the news in the city, and all the city made outcry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, when Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he saidWhat meaneth the noise of this tumult? And, the man, hasted, and came, and told Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now, Eli, was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were fixed, that he could not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the man said unto Eli, I, am he that came in from the army, yea, I, from the army, fled to-day. And he saidWhat is the thing that hath happened, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the bearer of tidings answered, and saidIsrael hath fled before the Philistines, Moreover also, a great smiting, hath taken place among the people,Moreover also, thy two sons, are slain, Hophni and Phinehas, And, the ark of God, is taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backwards, at the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died, for, old, was the man, and, heavy,and, he had judged Israel forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, his daughter-in-law, wife of Phinehas, was with child, ready to give birth, and, when she heard the tidings, as to the taking of the ark of God, and the death of her father-in-law, and her husband, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her pains had seized her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said: Do not fear, for, to a son, hast thou given birth. But she neither answered nor regarded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she called the boy I-chabod! saying, Exiled is the glory from Israel,In regard to the taking of the ark of God, and to her father-in-law, and to her husband. \fs15</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So she saidExiled is the glory from Israel,For the ark of God hath been taken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
