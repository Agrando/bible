So the Kenites departed out of the midst of the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul smote Amalek,from Havilah, till thou enterest Shur, which is over against Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag, king of Amalek, alive,but, all the people, devoted he to destruction at the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and the oxen and the lambs, also the fatlings, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction,but, all the cattle that was contemptible and diseased, that, devoted they to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then came the word of Yahweh unto Samuel, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am grieved that I made Saul to be king, for he hath turned back from following me, and, my words, hath he not established. And it was vexing to Samuel, so that he made outcry unto Yahweh, all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul, in the morning, and it was told Samuel, sayingSaul having come to Carmel, and lo! having set him up a sign, hath gone round, and passed over, and descended to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came unto Saul,and Saul said unto himBlessed, be thou by Yahweh: I have established the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, What then is this bleating of sheep, in mine ears,and the lowing of oxen, which I can hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said SaulFrom the Amalekites, have they brought them in; in that the people spared the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Yahweh thy God,but, the rest, have we devoted to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Samuel unto Saul, Stay, and let me tell thee, that which Yahweh hath spoken unto me, this night. And he said to himSpeak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, Was it not, when, little, thou wast in thine own eyes, that thou wast made, head of the tribes of Israel,and that Yahweh anointed thee to be king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then Yahweh sent thee on a journey,and saidGo, and devastate to destruction, the sinnersthe Amalekites, and make war against them, until they have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore, then, didst thou not hearken unto the voice of Yahweh,but didst rush upon the spoil, and do that which was wrong in the sight of Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said unto SamuelAs indeed I have hearkened unto the voice of Yahweh, and have been on the journey on which Yahweh sent me,and have brought in Agag, king of Amalek, and, the Amalekites, have I devoted to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people took, of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things so devoted,to sacrifice unto Yahweh thy God, in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said SamuelDoth that which is pleasing unto Yahweh consist in ascending-offerings and sacrifices, So much as in hearkening unto the voice of Yahweh? Lo! to hearken, is, better, than, sacrifice. And, to give heed, than, the fat of rams;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, as the sin of divination, is, rebelliousness,and, as transgression with household gods, is, stubbornness,Because thou hast rejected the word of Yahweh, therefore hath he rejected thee from being king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Saul unto SamuelI have sinned; for I have transgressed the bidding of Yahweh, and thy words,for I feared the people, and hearkened unto their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin,and turn again with me, that I may bow down unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not turn again with thee,Because thou hast rejected the word of Yahweh, therefore hath Yahweh rejected thee from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, when Samuel turned about to go away, then laid he hold of the skirt of his robe, and it was rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said unto him, Yahweh hath rent the kingdom of Israel from off thee, to-day,and will give it unto a neighbour of thine, who is better than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moreover also, the Eminence of Israel, will not lie, neither will he repent,For no, iron of earth, is, he, to repent!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said: I have sinned, Now, honour me, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel,and turn again with me, then will I bow down unto Yahweh thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then Samuel turned again, after Sauland Saul bowed down unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then said SamuelBring ye near unto meAgag, king of Amalek, And Agag came unto him, in fetters. Then said Agag, Surely, terrible, is the bitterness of death!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, As women have been made childless by thy sword, So, childless among women, shall be, thine own mother. And Samuel cut Agag asunder before Yahweh, in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel departed unto Ramah,but, Saul, went up unto his own house, at Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel did no more see Saul, until the day of his death, for Samuel pined for Saul,but, Yahweh, was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
