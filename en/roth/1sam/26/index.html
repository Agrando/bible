And Abishai said, I, will go down with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David came, with Abishai, unto the people by night, and lo! Saul lying asleep, within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground, at his head,and Abner and the people lying round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Abishai unto David, God hath surrendered, to-day, thine enemy, into thy hand: Now, therefore, let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth, at one stroke, I, will not do it twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But David said unto Abishai, Do not destroy him,for who that hath thrust forth his hand against the Anointed of Yahweh, shall be guiltless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David saidBy the life of Yahweh, surely, Yahweh himself, must smite him,or, his day, must come that he die, or, into battle, must he go down, and be swept away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Far be it from me, of Yahweh, that I should thrust forth my hand against the anointed of Yahweh! Now, therefore, take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So David took the spear, and the cruse of water, from near the head of Saul, and they went their way,and no man saw, and no man knew, and no man awoke, for all of them were sleeping, for, a deep sleep from Yahweh, had fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then David crossed over to the other side, and took his stand on the top of the mountain, afar off,a great space, being between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David cried aloud unto the people, and unto Abner son of Ner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abner? Then answered Abner, and said, Who art thou, that hast cried aloud unto the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said unto AbnerArt not thou, a man? Who indeed is like thee, in Israel? Wherefore, then, hast thou not kept watch over thy lord, the king? For one of the people hath entered, to destroy the kingthy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Not good, is this thing which thou hast done, by the life of Yahweh, verily, worthy of death, ye are, in that ye have not kept watch over your lord, over, the Anointed of Yahweh. Now, therefore, see where the spear of the king is, and the cruse of water, that was at his head?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul knew the voice of David, and saidThy voice, is this, my son David? And David said, My voice, my lord O king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Wherefore is it, that my lord is in pursuit of his servant? For what have I done? or what is in my hand that is wrong?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant,If, Yahweh, have goaded thee on against me, let him accept the sweet smell of a gift, but, if the sons of men, accursed, they are before Yahweh, for they have driven me out, to-day, from joining myself with the inheritance of Yahweh, sayingGo, serve other gods!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth, away from the presence of Yahweh,for the king of Israel hath come out to hunt for a single flea, as when one pursueth a partridge among the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said SaulI have sinned, Return, my son David, for I will harm thee no more, because my life was precious in thine eyes, this day,lo! I have acted foolishly and, greatly, erred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David responded, and said, Lo! the spear of the king! Let, therefore, one of the young men come over, and fetch it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And let, Yahweh, give back to each man, his righteousness, and his faithfulness,in that Yahweh delivered thee, to-day, into my hand, but I would not thrust forth my hand against the Anointed of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Lo! then, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so, let my life be much set by in the eyes of Yahweh, and let him rescue me out of all tribulation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said Saul unto DavidBlessed, be thou, my son David, thou shalt both, do, and shalt, prevail. And David went on his way, but, Saul, returned unto his own place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
