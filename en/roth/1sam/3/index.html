And he saidI called not, returnIts down. So he went, and lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And again Yahweh called once thereSamuel! Then rose Samuel, and went unto Eli, and saidBehold me! for thou calledst me. And he saidI called not, my son, returnlie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, Samuel, as yet knew not Yahweh,nor, as yet, had been revealed unto him, the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again Yahweh calledSamuel! a third time. Then he arose, and went unto Eli, and saidBehold me! for thou calledst me. Then did Eli perceive, that, Yahweh, was calling the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Eli said to SamuelGo, lie down, and it shall be, if he call unto thee, that thou shalt saySpeak, Yahweh, for thy servant is listening. And Samuel went, and lay down in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then came Yahweh, and stood, and called as time after timeSamuel! Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant is listening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh said unto Samuel, Lo! I am doing a thing, in Israel,at which both ears of everyone that heareth it shall tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day, will I confirm against Eli, all that I have spoken against his house,beginning and finishing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore do I tell him, that I am about to judge his house unto times age-abiding, for the iniquity which he knoweth, in that his sons are cursing God, and he hath not rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And therefore have I sworn, respecting the house of Eli,that the iniquity of the house of Eli shall receive no propitiatory-covering, by sacrifice or by present, unto times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel lay until the morning, and rose early in the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh,but, Samuel, feared to tell the appearing, unto Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Eli called Samuel, and saidSamuel! my son. And he saidBehold me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he saidWhat is the word, which he spake unto thee? I pray thee, do not hide it from me. So, let God do to thee, and, so, let him add, if thou hide from me a word, out of anything which he hath spoken unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said, Yahweh, he is; what is good in his own eyes, let him do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel grew,and, Yahweh, proved to he with him, and let none of all his words fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, came to know,that Samuel had become confirmed as a prophet unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus did Yahweh again appear in Shiloh,for Yahweh had revealed himself unto Samuel in Shiloh, in the word of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
