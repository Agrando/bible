I am with thee!), according to thine own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Jonathan, Lo! we, are crossing over unto the men,and will discover ourselves unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If, thus, they say unto us, Keep quiet until we get to you, then will we stand still where we are, and will not go up unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but, if thus, they say, Come up unto us, then will we go up; for Yahweh hath delivered them into our hand,This, then, is our sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So they two discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines,and the Philistines saidLo! Hebrews, coming forth out of the holes, wherein they had hidden themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men of the garrison responded to Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and saidCome up unto us, and we will let you know a thing. Then said Jonathan unto his armour-bearerCome up after me, for Yahweh hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Jonathan went up on his hands and on his feet, and, his armour-bearer, followed him,and they fell before Jonathan, and, his armour-bearer, was slaying after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the first smiting wherewith Jonathan and his armour-bearer smote, was about twenty men,within, as it were, half a furrows length of a yoke of land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there came to be a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people, the outposts and the spoilers, they too, trembled,and the earth quaked, so it became a preternatural trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the scouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and lo! the camp, melted away, hither and thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Saul unto the people who were with him: Number, I pray you, and see who hath departed from us. So they numbered; and lo! Jonathan and his armour-bearer were missing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said Saul unto Ahijah, Bring near the ark of God; for the ark of God was, on that day, in the midst of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, as soon as Saul had spoken unto the priest, that, the tumultuous noise that was in the camp of the Philistines, went on and on, increasing. Then said Saul unto the priest,Withdraw thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul and all the people that were with him gathered themselves together, and came as far as the host,and lo! the sword of every man was against his fellow, an exceeding great confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, the Hebrews who had aforetime belonged to the Philistines, who had come up with them in the host, even they, turned round so as to be with Israel who were with Saul and Jonathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves throughout the hill country of Ephraim, heard that the Philistines had fled, and, they also, followed hard after them in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus did Yahweh, on that day, save Israel,and, the battle, passed over by Beth-aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, the men of Israel, were tired out on that day,yet had Saul bound the people by an oath, sayingCursed, be the man that eateth food until the evening, and I be avenged upon mine enemies. So none of the people had tasted food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, all the land, had entered into the forest,and there was honey upon the face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the people came into the forest, and lo! there were streams of honey,but no man reached his hand to his mouth, because the people revered the oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, Jonathan, heard not his father putting the people on oath, so he reached forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honey-copse,and brought back his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were brightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then responded one from among the people, and saidWith an oath, did thy father charge the people, sayingCursed, be the man that eateth food to-day! And so the people were faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then said Jonathan: My father hath afflicted the land,See, I pray you, how my own eyes have been brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How much more if haply the people had, eaten freely, to-day of the spoil of their enemies, which they found? for, now, would not the smiting of the Philistines have been, mighty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Howbeit they smote the Philistines on that day from Michmash to Aijalon,but the people became exceeding faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people darted greedily upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and felled them to the ground,and the people did eat, with the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they told Saul, saying, Lo! the people, are sinning against Yahweh, by eating with the blood. And he saidYe have dealt treacherously, roll unto me, here, a great stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Saul saidDisperse yourselves among the people, and say unto themBring near unto me every man his ox,, and every man his lamb, and slay them here, and then eat, so shall ye not sin against Yahweh, by eating with the blood. And all the people brought nearevery man that which was in his hand, that night, and they slew them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Saul built an altar unto Yahweh,the same, was the first altar that he built unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said SaulLet us go down after the Philistines by night, and make of them a prey until the morning light, and let us not leave of them, a man. And they said, All that is good in thine eyes, do! Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So Saul asked of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not, that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then said Saul, Come near hither, all ye chiefs of the people,and get to know and see, wherein, hath been this sin, to-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For, by the life of Yahweh, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, yet shall he, die. But there was none ready to answer him, of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then said he unto all IsraelYe, shall be on one side, and, I and Jonathan my son, will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, What is good in thine eyes, do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Saul said unto YahwehO God of Israel! now set forth the truth. Then were, Jonathan and Saul, taken, and, the people, escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Saul said, Cast lots between me, and Jonathan my son. Then was, Jonathan, taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Saul said unto Jonathan, Come tell me, what thou hast done. So Jonathan told him, and said, I, just tasted, with the end of the staff that was in my hand, a little honey, here I amI must die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then said Saul: So, may God do, and, so, may he add, surely thou must, die, Jonathan!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the people said unto SaulShall, Jonathan, die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far be it! By the life of Yahweh, there shall not fall a hair of his head to the ground, for, with God, hath he wrought this day. So the people delivered Jonathan, that he died not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines,and, the Philistines, departed unto their own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, Saul, took possession of the kingdom over Israel,and made war round about against all his enemiesagainst Moab, and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines, and, whomsoever he turned against, he was victorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then made he ready a force, and smote the Amalekites,and delivered Israel out of the hand of such as plundered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua,and, the names of his two daughters, were, the name of the firstborn, Merab, and, the name of the younger, Michal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and, the name of Sauls wife, was Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz,and the name of the prince of his host, Abner, son of Ner, Sauls uncle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, Kish, was Sauls father, and, Ner, Abners father, was son of Abiel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the war was severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul,and, whensoever Saul saw any mighty man, or any son of valour, he drew him unto himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
