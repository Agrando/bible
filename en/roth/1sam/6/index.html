Let us know, wherewith we shall send it to its own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they saidIf ye are going to send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away, empty, but ye must, surely return, to him, a guilt-offering,then, shall ye be healed, and it shall be known to you, wherefore his hand would not turn away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they saidWhat shall be the guilt-offering, that we shall return to him? And they saidBy the number of the lords of the Philistines, five tumours of gold, and five mice of gold,for, one plague, was on you all, and on your lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore ye shall make likenesses of your turnouts, and likenesses of your mice that are laying waste the land, and shall, give unto the, God of Israel, glory,Peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your god, and from off your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Wherefore, then, should ye make your heart dull, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh made their heart dull! When he had done his great doings upon them, did they not let them go, and they departed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, therefore, take and get ready, one new waggon, and two milch kine, whereon hath never come yoke,then shall ye fasten the kine in the waggon, and withdraw their calves from them, into the shed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and ye shall take the ark of Yahweh, and place it in the waggon, also, the jewels of gold which ye send back to him as a guilt-offering, shall ye put into a coffer, at the side thereof,so shall ye let it go, and it shall depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shall ye lookif, by the way of its own boundary, it goeth up to Beth-shemesh, he, it was who caused us this great affliction,but, if not, then shall we know that it was not, his hand, that smote us, a chance, it was, that befell us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The men, therefore, did so, and took two milch kine, and fastened them in the waggon,but, their calves, shut they up in the shed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they put the ark of Yahweh, into the waggon,also the coffer, with the mice of gold, and the likenesses of their tumours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the kine went straight along the road, on the way to Beth-shemesh, yea, along the main highway, they went, lowing as they went, turning not aside, to the right hand or to the left.
