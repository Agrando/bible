Am not, I, a Philistine, while, ye, are servants unto Saul? Choose you a man, and let him come down unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If he prevail in fighting with me, and smite me, then will we become your servants,but, if, I, prevail over him, and smite him, then shall ye become our servants, and serve, us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Philistine saidI, reproach the ranks of Israel, this day,give me a man, that we may fight together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and feared exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now, David, was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem-judah, whose, name, was Jesse, and, who, had eight sons,and, the man, in the days of Saul was old, advanced in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the three eldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle,and, the names of his three sons who went into the battle, were Eliab the firstborn, and, the next to him, Abinadab, and, the third, Shammah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, as for David, he, was the youngest,and, the three eldest, followed Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>whereas, David, kept going and returning from Saul,to tend his fathers sheep at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Philistine drew near morning and evening,and presented himself forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesse said unto David his son, Take, I pray thee, unto thy brethrenthis ephah of parched corn, and these ten loaves,and run to the camp unto thy brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>also these ten slices of soft cheese, shalt thou take to the captain of their thousand,and, as for thy brethren, give good heed to their welfare, their pledge, also shalt thou receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, ready to fight with the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So then David rose up early in the morning, and entrusted the sheep to a keeper, and took up   and went his way, as Jesse had commanded him,and came into the circular rampart, as, the force, was going forth into the ranks, and shouted for the fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Israel and the Philistines set in array for battle, army against army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David entrusted the provisions that were upon him to the care of the keeper of the stores, and ran unto the ranks,and came and asked for the welfare of his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, as he was speaking with them, lo! the champion coming up, Goliath the Philistine, by name, of Gath,   .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from before him, and feared exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the men of Israel saidHave ye seen this man that is coming up? For, to reproach Israel, is he coming. So then it shall be, that, the man that shall smite him, the same, will the king enrich with great riches, and, his own daughter, will give him, and, his fathers house, will he make free in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then spake David unto the men that were standing by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that shall smite yonder Philistine, and so shall take away reproach from off Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he hath reproached the ranks of a Living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the people answered him, according to this word saying,So, shall it be done to the man that shall smite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men,then was kindled the anger of Eliab against David, and he saidWherefore is it that thou hast come down? and to whom hast thou entrusted those few sheep in the wilderness? I, know thy pride, and the foolishness of thy heart, for, to see the battle, hast thou come down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And David said, What have I done, now? Was there not, a cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then turned he from him unto another, and saidaccording to this word,and the people returned him an answer, like the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the words which David spake were overheard,and, when they told them before Saul, he summoned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And David said unto Saul, Let not the heart of my lord fail, because of him,thy servant, will go, and fight with this Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul said unto DavidThou art not able to go against this Philistine, to fight with him,for, a youth, art, thou, but, he, a man of war, from his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said David unto Saul, Thy servant used to tend his fathers sheep,and there would come a lion, or a bear, and carry off a lamb out of the flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and I would go out after him, and smite him, and rescue it out of his mouth,and, if he rose against me, I would catch him by his beard, and smite him, and slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thy servant could slay, either a lion or a bear,and, this uncircumcised Philistine, shall become, as one of them, for he hath reproached the ranks of a Living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And David said, Yahweh, who hath rescued me out of the power of the lion, and out of the power of the bear, he, will rescue us out of the hand of this Philistine. Then said Saul unto DavidGo! and, Yahweh, will be with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul clad David with his own military coat, and set a helmet of bronze upon his head,and clad him with a coat of mail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And David girded his sword above his military coat, but was reluctant to go, for he had not proved them,so David said unto SaulI cannot go in these, for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then took he his stick in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the torrent-bed, and put them in the shepherds-pouch which he hadeven in the wallet, and had his sling in his hand,and so drew near unto the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the Philistine came on and on, and drew near unto David,and the man carrying the shield was before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him,for he was a youth, and ruddy, a stripling of fair countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then said the Philistine unto David, A dog, am, I, that thou art coming unto me, with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David, by his god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Philistine said unto David,Come, unto me, that I may give thy flesh to the birds of heaven, and to the beasts of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then said David unto the PhilistineThou, art coming unto me with sword, and with spear, and with javelin,but, I, am coming unto thee in the name of Yahweh of hosts, God of the ranks of Israel which thou hast reproached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This day, will Yahweh deliver thee into my hand, and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee, and will give thy dead body and the dead bodies of the host of Philistines, this day, unto the birds of heaven, and unto the wild beasts of the earth,that all the earth may know that Israel hath a God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that all this gathered host may know that, not with sword and with spear, doth Yahweh save,for, unto Yahweh, belongeth the battle, and he will deliver you into our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the ranks to meet the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And David thrust his hand into his pouch, and took from thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine, in his forehead,that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face, to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Thus David prevailed over the Philistine, with the sling and with the stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him,but, sword, was there none in the hand of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So David ran, and stood by the Philistine, and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off, therewith, his head,and, when the Philistines saw that their hero was slain, they fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then arose the men of Israel and Judah, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, as far as the entrance into Gath, and as far as the gates of Ekron,and the slain of the Philistines fell in the way to the two gates, even as far as Gath and as far as Ekron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the sons of Israel returned from hotly pursuing the Philistines,and plundered their camps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it into Jerusalem,but, his armour, put he into his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And, when Saul saw David going forth to meet the Philistine, he said unto Abner, prince of the host, Whose son is the young man, Abner? And Abner said, By the life of thy soul, O king! I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then said the king,Ask, thou, whose son the stripling is?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And, when David returned from smiting the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul,with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Saul said unto him, Whose son art, thou, O young man? And David said, Son of thy servant Jesse, the Bethlehemite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
