And he offered up the ascending-sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as he had made an end of offering up the ascending-sacrifice, lo! Samuel, had come,and Saul went out to meet him, that he might bless him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said SamuelWhat hast thou done? And Saul saidBecause I saw that the people had been scattered from me, and, thou, hadst not come within the appointed days, and, the Philistines, had gathered themselves together to Michmash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>therefore I saidNow, will the Philistines come down against me, at Gilgal, but, the face of Yahweh, have I not appeased: So I forced myself, and offered up the ascending-sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel said unto SaulThou hast shewn thyself foolish,thou hast not kept the commandment of Yahweh thy God, which he commanded thee, for, now, would Yahweh have established thy kingdom unto Israel until times age-abiding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whereas, now, shall thy kingdom not be established,Yahweh hath sought out for him a man after his own heart, and Yahweh hath commanded him to be leader over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Yahweh commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose, and ascended from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with him, were abiding in Geba of Benjamin,but, the Philistines, had encamped in Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the spoilers came forth out of the camp of the Philistines, in three companies, the first company, turned unto the way of Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and, the second company, turned unto the way of Beth-horon,and, the third company, turned unto the way of the boundary that overlooketh the valley of Zeboim, towards the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, a smith, could not be found, throughout all the land of Israelfor the Philistines had said, Lest the Hebrews make sword or spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So all Israel went down to the Philistines,to sharpen every man his share, and his mattock, and his axe, and his sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Howbeit they had a file for the sickles, and the mattocks, and the three-pronged forks, and the axes,and for setting the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus would it come to pass, in the day of battle, that there was foundneither sword nor spear, in the hand of any of the people, that were with Saul and Jonathan, but such were found belonging to Saul and to Jonathan his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the garrison of the Philistines had come out to the pass of Michmash.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
