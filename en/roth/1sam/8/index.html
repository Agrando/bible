So Samuel prayed unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Yahweh said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people, in all that they shall say unto thee,for, not thee, have they rejected, but, me, have they rejected, from being king over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According to all the doings which they have done, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt, even until this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so, are they doing even unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, therefore, hearken to their voice,save that thou, enter protest, against them, and tell them the manner of the king who will reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So then Samuel spake all the words of Yahweh unto the people, who were asking of him, a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, This, will be the manner of the king who will reign over you,Your sons, will he take and appoint for himself, as his charioteers and as his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he will appoint for himself, princes of thousands, and princes of fifties,and to plough his fields, and to reap his harvest, and to make his weapons of war, and the instruments of his chariots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, your daughters, will he take,as perfumers and as cooks, and as bakers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, the best of them, will he take, and give to his servants;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, your seed, and your vineyards, will he tithe, and give to his courtiers and to his servants;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, your men-servants, and your maidservants, and your oxen, even the goodliest, and your asses, will he take,and put them to his work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your flocks, will he tithe,and, ye yourselves, shall become his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then will ye make outcry, in that day, because of your king whom ye have chosen for yourselves,and Yahweh will not answer you, in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel,and they saidNay! but, a king, shall be over us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so shall, even we, become like all the nations,and our king shall judge us, and go forth before us, and fight our battles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Samuel heard all the words of the people,and spake them in the ears of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Yahweh said unto Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel: Go ye, every man to his own city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
