I am coming down unto thee, to offer up ascending-offerings, to sacrifice peace-offerings,seven days, shalt thou tarry, until I come unto thee, then will I let thee know what thou shalt do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And so it was, that, when he turned away to depart from Samuel, God gave him another heart,and all these signs came to pass that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, when they came thither to the hill, lo! a band of prophets coming to meet him,then came suddenly upon him, the Spirit of God, and he was moved to prophesy in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, that, all who knew him aforetime, looked, and lo! with the prophets, he did prophesy. So the people said, one to anotherWhat, now, hath befallen the son of Kish? Is, even Saul, among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then responded one of that place, and said, But who is, their father? For this cause, it became a proverb, Is, even Saul, among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said Sauls uncle unto him, and unto his young manWhither have ye been? And he said, To seek the asses, and, when they were nowhere, to be seen, we came unto Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Sauls uncle said,Do tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul said unto his uncle, He, told, us that the asses were found,but, as to the matter of the kingdom, he told him not what Samuel had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Samuel called out the people, unto Yahweh, at Mizpah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and said unto the sons of IsraelThus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel: I myself, brought up Israel, out of Egypt,and rescued you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that distressed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet, ye, to-day, have rejected your God, who, himself, hath been giving you salvation from all your calamities and your distresses, and ye have said to him: A king, shalt thou set over us,Now, therefore, present yourselves before Yahweh, by your tribes, and by your thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, when Samuel had brought near all the tribes of Israel, then was taken the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, when he had brought near the tribe of Benjamin, by their families, then was taken the family of Matri,and, when he had brought near the family of Matri, man by man, then was taken Saul the son of Kish; so they sought him, but he was not to be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then asked they again of Yahweh, Hath there yet to come in hither a man? And Yahweh said, Lo! he, hath hid himself among the stores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they ran, and fetched him thence, and, when he presented himself in the midst of the people, then was he   taller than any of the people, from his shoulders and upwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Samuel said unto all the peopleHave ye seen him whom Yahweh hath chosen, that there is none like him, among all the people? And all the people shouted, and saidLet the king live!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Samuel declared unto the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a scroll, and laid it up before Yahweh. And Samuel sent away all the people, every man to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yea, even Saul, went to his own house, at Gibeah,and the valiant men whose heart God had moved went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, abandoned men, saidHow can this one save us? So they treated him with contempt, and brought him no present,but he was as one that was deaf.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
