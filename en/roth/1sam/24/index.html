David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men, out of all Israel,and went to seek David and his men, over the face of the rocks of the mountain-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he came into the sheep-folds by the way, there, being a cave, which Saul entered, to cover his feet,David and his men, in the hinder part of the cave, having taken up their abode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Davids men said unto himLo! the day of which Yahweh said unto theeLo! I am about to deliver up thine enemy, into thy hand: therefore shall thou do unto him, as shall be good in thine eyes. And David arose, and cut off the corner of the robe which belonged to Saul, by stealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass afterwards that Davids heart smote him,because he had cut off the corner   which belonged to Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto his menFar be it from me, of Yahweh, that I should do this thing unto my lord, unto the Anointed of Yahweh, to thrust forth my hand against him,for, the Anointed of Yahweh, is he!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David did chide his men with the words, and did not suffer them to rise up against Saul. And, Saul, rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then David rose up, afterwards, and went forth out of the cave, and cried out after Saul, sayingMy lord, O king! And, when Saul looked about behind him, David inclined his face to the earth, and bowed himself down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said David to Saul, Wherefore shouldst thou hearken unto the words of the sons of earth, saying,Lo! David is seeking thy hurt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Lo! this day, have thine own eyes seen, how Yahweh had delivered thee up, to-day, into my hand in the cave, and, when one bade me slay thee, I looked with compassion upon thee,and I saidI will not thrust forth my hand against my lord, for, the Anointed of Yahweh, is he!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, my father, see, yea, see, the corner of thy robe in my hand,for, in that I cut off the corner of thy robe, and yet did not slay thee, know thou, and see, that there is not in my hand either wrong or transgression, neither have I sinned against thee, yet art thou hunting my life, to take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let Yahweh do justice betwixt me and thee, and let Yahweh avenge me of thee,but, mine own hand, shall not be upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As saith the proverb of the ancients, From the lawless, proceedeth lawlessness,mine own hand, therefore shall not be upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After whom, hath the king of Israel come forth? After whom, art thou in pursuit? After a dead dog! after a single flea!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore shall, Yahweh, become, judge, and do justice betwixt me and thee,that he may see, and plead my cause, and justly deliver me out of thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Thy voice, is this, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said unto David, More righteous, art thou than I, for, thou, hast requited me, good, but, I, have requited thee, evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou, then, hast told to-day, how thou hast dealt with me, for good,how, when Yahweh had surrendered me into thy hand, thou didst not slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet, when a man findeth his enemy, will he let him get easily away? Yahweh, then, give thee, good, reward for what, this day, thou hast done unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, therefore, lo! I know that thou, shalt indeed become king,and that the kingdom of Israel, shall be established in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, therefore, swear unto me by Yahweh, that thou wilt not eat off my seed, after me,and wilt not destroy my name out of the house my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So David sware unto Saul,and Saul departed unto his own house, but, David and his men, went up on the stronghold.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
