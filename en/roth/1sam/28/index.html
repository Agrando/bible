And Achish said unto David, Therefore, keeper of my head, will I appoint thee, all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now, Samuel, was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city,Saul, moreover had put away them who had familiar spirits and them who were oracles, out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So then the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came in, and encamped in Shunem,and Saul gathered together all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Saul enquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh answered him not,neither by Dreams, nor by the Lights, nor by prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Saul unto his servantsSeek me out a woman that owneth a familiar spirit, that I may even go unto her, and enquire of her. And his servants said unto him, Lo! there is a woman that owneth a familiar spirit in En-dor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Saul therefore disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and departedhe and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night,and he saidDivine for me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring up for mewhomsoever I shall name unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the woman said unto himLo! thou, knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off them who have familiar spirits and him who is an oracle, out of the land,wherefore, then, art thou striking at my life, to put me to death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So then Saul sware unto her by Yahweh, saying,By the life of Yahweh, there shall no punishment befall thee for this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up for thee? And he said, Samuel, bring thou up for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, when the woman saw Samuel, she made outcry with a loud voice,and the woman spake unto Saul, sayingWherefore hast thou deceived me, thou thyself being Saul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king said unto herBe not afraid, but what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, A god, saw I, coming up out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to herWhat was his form? And she saidAn old man, coming up, he being wrapped about with a robe. Then Saul knew, that it was, Samuel, so he inclined his face to the earth, and bowed himself down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel said unto Saul, Wherefore hast thou disquieted me, by bringing me up? And Saul saidI am in sore distress, for, the Philistines, are making war against me, and, God, hath turned away from me, and answereth me no moreeither by means of the prophets, or by dreams, therefore have I even called for thee, to let me know, what I am to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Samuel, Wherefore, then, shouldst thou ask me,when, Yahweh, hath turned away from thee, and hath come to be with thy neighbour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore hath Yahweh done for him, as he spake by me,yea Yahweh hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to a neighbour of thineto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Yahweh, neither didst execute the glow of his anger upon Amalek, therefore, this thing, hath Yahweh done unto thee this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>that Yahweh may deliver, Israel also, with thee, into the hand of the Philistines, and, to-morrow, thou and thy sons with thee are about to fall,the host of Israel also, will Yahweh deliver, into the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Saul hastened, and fell prostratethe whole length of himto the earth, and was sore afraid, at the words of Samuel, and indeed, no, strength, was left in him, for he had not eaten food all the day and all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the woman came unto Saul, and, when she saw that he was greatly terrified, she said unto himLo! thy handmaid hearkened unto thy voice, and I put my life into my hand, and heard thy words which thou didst speak unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now, therefore, I pray thee, hearken, thou also, unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set before thee a morsel of food, and eat thou,that there may be in thee strength, when thou goest on thy journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he refused, and saidI will not eat. But, when his servants, and the woman also, strongly urged him, then hearkened he unto their voice,and rose up from the earth, and sat on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, the woman, had a calf fattening, in the shed. So she hastened, and sacrificed it,and took meal, and kneaded, and baked thereof, unleavened cakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and brought near before Saul and before his servants, and they did eat. Then rose they up and departed, the same night.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
