Am, I, not better to thee, than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Hannah rose up, after she had eaten in Shiloh, and after she had drunk,and, Eli the priest, was sitting upon his chair, by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and, she being in bitterness of soul, prayed unto Yahweh, and, wept sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow, and saidYahweh of hosts! If thou wilt, look, upon the humiliation of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then will I give him unto Yahweh, all the days of his life, and no, razor, shall come upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And so it was, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli was watching her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for, Hannah, she, was speaking in her heart, only her lips, were moving, but, her voice, could not be heard,so Eli thought she had been drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said unto her, How long, wilt thou be, drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah responded and saidNay! my lord; A woman depressed in spirit, am I: neither wine nor strong drink, have I drunk,but I poured out my soul, before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not count thy handmaid for an abandoned woman,for, out of the abundance of my grief and my vexation, have I spoken, hitherto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then responded Eli, and saidGo and prosper! And the, God of Israel, grant thy petition which thou hast asked of him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said: Let thy serving-woman find favour, in thine eyes. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and, her countenance, was sad no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and worshipped before Yahweh, and returned, and entered their own house, in Ramah,and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and Yahweh remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so it was, when the days had come round during which Hannah was with child, that she bare a son,and called his name Samuel, Because, of Yahweh, I asked him. \fs15</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up, to offer unto Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and   his own vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But, Hannah, went not up,for she said to her husband  till the boy is weaned, then will I take him, and he shall appear before Yahweh, and abide there evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said to herDo what is good in thine own eyes, tarry until thou have weaned him, only may Yahweh establish his word! So the woman tarried, and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then took she him up with her, when she had weaned him, with a bullock of three years old, and one ephah of meal, and a skin of wine, and took him to the house of Yahweh, at Shiloh,the boy yet being young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So they slew the bullock,and took the boy in, unto Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she saidPardon, my lord! By the life of thy soul, my lord,I, am the woman who was standing near thee here, praying unto Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this boy, I prayed,And Yahweh hath given me my petition which I asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Hence, I also, have loaned him unto Yahweh, all the days that he liveth. He, is lent unto Yahweh. And he bowed down there, unto Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
