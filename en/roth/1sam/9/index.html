I pray thee, a man of God,   in this city, and, the man, is held in honour, all that he saith, surely cometh to pass. Now, let us go thither; peradventure he may tell us our way, whereon we should have gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Saul to his young man: Behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man, for, the bread, hath failed from our sacks, and, present, there is none to bring to the man of God,what is there with us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the young man again answered Saul, and saidLo! there is found in my hand, the fourth part of a shekel of silver,which thou canst give to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Beforetime, in Israel, thus, said a man when he went to enquire of God, Come and let us go as far as the seer,for, the prophet of to-day, used to be called, beforetime, the seer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul said unto his young man, Good, is thy word, come! let us go! So they went unto the city, where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were going up the ascent of the city, when they found young women, coming out to draw water,so they said unto these, Is, the seer, in this place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the young women answered them and said: He is, lo! before you now, even as, to-day, hath he entered the city, for the people have a sacrifice, to-day, in the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As ye enter the city, so, shall ye surely find him, ere yet he shall go up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he hath come, for, he, doth bless the sacrifice, after that, will they eat who have been bidden. Now, therefore, go up, for, about this very time, shall ye surely find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So they went up into the city. As they were entering into the midst of the city, lo! Samuel, coming out over against them, to ascend the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now, Yahweh, had unveiled the ear of Samuel,one day before Saul came, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>About this time to-morrow, will I send unto thee, a man out of the land of Benjamin, whom thou shalt anoint, to be leader over my people Israel, and he shall save my people, out of the hand of the Philistines,for I have looked upon the oppression, because their outcry hath come in unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, when, Samuel, beheld Saul, Yahweh, answered him, Lo! the man, of whom I said unto thee, Here, is one shall control my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul drew near unto Samuel, in the midst of the gate,and saidI pray thee, do tell me, where is the house of the seer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul, and saidI, am, the seer! Go up before me, to the high place, so shall ye eat with me, to-day,and I will let thee go in the morning, and, all that is in thy heart, will I tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, as for the asses that went astray from thee three days ago, do not regard them, for they are found,but to whom belongeth all that is desirable in Israel? is it not to thee, and to all the house of thy father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then answered Saul, and saidAm not I, a man of Benjamin, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and   , my family, the poorest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Wherefore, then, hast thou spoken unto me of such a thing as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his young man, and brought them into the guest-chamber,and gave them a place at the head of them who were bidden, they being about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said to the cook, Set on the portion that I gave thee,of which I said unto thee, Put it by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and placed it before Saul, and saidLo! the part reserved! Set it before thee   eat, for, unto the time appointed, hath it been kept for thee, since the time that I said, The people, have I bidden. So Saul did eat with Samuel, on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, when they had come down from the high place into the city, he spread a couch for Saul upon the house-top, and he lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass, at the uprisings of the dawn, that Samuel called unto Saul on the house-top, saying, Arise! that I may send thee away. So Saul arose, and they two, he and Samuel, went forth abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As they were going down the end of the city, Samuel, said unto SaulBid the young man, that he pass on before us, (and he passed on) but, thou, stand still where thou art, that I may let time hear the word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
