But David moved round from before him, twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul feared because of David,for Yahweh was with him, whereas, from Saul, he had departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Saul removed him from him, and appointed him to be for him the captain of a thousand,and he went out and came in before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass that David, in all his ways, acted prudently,and, Yahweh, was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, when Saul saw that, he, was acting very prudently, he was afraid of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, all Israel and Judah, were in love with David,for he was going out and coming in before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then Saul said unto DavidLo! my elder daughter Merab, her, will I give thee to wife, only, approve thyself unto me as a son of valour and fight the battles of Yahweh. Saul, however, had said to himselfLet not, my own hand, be upon him, but let, the hand of the Philistines, be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David said unto SaulWho am, I, or who are my kinsfolk, the family of my father, in Israel,that I should become son-in-law, to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But it came to pass, within the time for giving Merab daughter of Saul to David, that, she, was given to Adriel the Meholathite, to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then did Michal, Sauls daughter, love David,and it was told Saul, and the thing was right in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said to himselfI will give her unto him, that she may prove to him a snare, and that, the hand of the Philistines, may be upon him. So then Saul said unto David, A second time, mayest thou become my son-in-law to-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul commanded his servantsSpeak ye unto David quietly saying, Lo! the king delighteth in thee, and, all his servants, love thee,now, therefore, become thou son-in-law to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the servants of Saul spake, in the ears of David, these words. And David saidSeemeth it a light thing, in your eyes, to become son-in-law to the king, seeing that, I, am a poor man and lightly esteemed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the servants of Saul told him, saying,According to these words, spake David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said SaulThus, shall ye say unto DavidThe king hath no delight in purchase-price, but rather in a hundred foreskins of Philistines, by avenging himself on the enemies of the king. But, Saul, thought to let David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So, when his servants told David these words, the thing was right in the eyes of David, to become son-in-law unto the king,and the days had not expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore David arose, and wenthe and his men, and smote among the Philistines two hundred men, and David brought in their foreskins, and gave them in full tale unto the king, that he might become son-in-law unto the king, and Saul gave him Michal his daughter, to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Saul saw and knew that, Yahweh, was with David, and that, all Israel, loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So then Saul went on to fear because of David, yet more,and it came to pass that Saul was hostile to David, all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, when the princes of the Philistines came forth, so it was, that, as often as they came forth, David was more circumspect than any of the servants of Saul, so that his name was, precious exceedingly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
