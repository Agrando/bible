For, to Yahweh, belong the pillars of the earth, And he setteth thereon the habitable world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The feet of his loving ones, he doth guard, But, the lawless, in darkness shall be silent,For, by strength, shall no man prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for Yahweh,they shall be shattered who contend with him, Over him, in the heavens will he thunder, Yahweh, will judge the ends of the earth,That he may give strength to his King, And exalt the horn of his Anointed One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then went Elkanah to Ramah, unto his own house,but, the boy, remained ministering unto Yahweh, before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now, the sons of Eli, were abandoned men,they knew not Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, the custom of the priests with the people, waswhen any man offered a sacrifice, then would come the priests young man, as the flesh was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and would strike it into the boiler, or into the trough, or into the kettle, or into the pot, all that the fork would bring up, the priest took for himself. Thus and thus, used they to do unto all Israel, who came thither, in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also, before any could make perfume with the fat, the priests young man would come in and say to the person who was sacrificing, Come! give flesh for the priests roastings,for he will not take of thee boiled fleshonly raw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, if the man said to him, Let them at least, make incense, at once with the fat, then take thou as much as thy soul craveth, Then said he to him, But, at once, shalt thou give it; or else, I will take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And so it was, that, the sin of the young men, was exceeding great, before Yahweh,for men scorned the offerings of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, as for Samuel, he was ministering before Yahweh,a boy girded with an ephod of linen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also, a little robe, used his mother to make for him, and bring it up to him, from year to year,when she came up with her husband, to offer the sacrifice of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Eli used to bless Elkanah and his wife, and to sayYahweh give thee seed of this woman, instead of the loan that hath been lent unto Yahweh. So they went their way to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons, and two daughters. Thus did the boy Samuel grow up with Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now, Eli, was very old,but he used to hear all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how they even lay with the women who did service, at the opening of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he said to them, Wherefore should ye do such things as these? for I keep hearing of your wicked doings, from all these people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nay, my sons! for it is no good report that I do hear: leading into transgression the people of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one man sin against another, God will interpose, but, if, against Yahweh, a man sin, who will intercede, for him? But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, for Yahweh was pleased to put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, the boy Samuel, went on growing in stature, and in favour,both with Yahweh, and also with men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there came a man of God, unto Eli,and said unto himThus, saith Yahweh, I, did indeed reveal myself, unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt, as servants unto the house of Pharaoh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>choosing him out of all the tribes of Israel unto myself, to minister as priest, to offer upon mine altar, to perfume with incense to bear an ephod before me,Therefore gave I unto the house of thy father all the altar-flames of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wherefore have ye been kicking at my sacrifices, and my presents, which I commanded, to serve for a home,and shouldest have honoured thy sons more than me: fattening yourselves, with the first of every present of Israel, before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Hence, the oracle of Yahweh God of Israel, I, said, that, thy house, and the house of thy father, should go to and fro in my presence, unto times age-abiding: But, now, (is the oracle of Yahweh)Be it far from me! For, them who honour me, will I honour, but, they who despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Lo! days are coming, when I will hew off thine arm, and the arm of the house of thy father,that there shall be no elder in thy house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But thou shalt descry distress at home, in all that shall gladden Israel,and there shall not be an elder in thine own house, all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But, any man of thine whom I may not cut off from mine altar, it shall beto consume his eyes, and grieve his soul; Howbeit, all the multitude of thy house, shall die, by the sword of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, this, for thee is the sign, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas,In one day, shall they, both of them, die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, According to that which is in my heart and in my soul, will he do; Therefore will I build for him an assured house, and he shall go to and fro in presence of mine Anointed, all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it shall be, that, any that is left in thy house, shall come bowing down to him for a small coin of silver, and for a cake of bread, and shall say: Appoint me, I pray thee, to one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
