And Samuel judged the sons of Israel in Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered themselves together unto Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel,and, when the sons of Israel heard it, they shrank with fear, from the face of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Israel said unto Samuel, Do not turn in silence from us, from making outcry unto Yahweh our God,that he would save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Samuel took one sucking lamb, and offered it up, as an entire ascending-sacrifice unto Yahweh,and Samuel made outcry unto Yahweh, for Israel, and Yahweh answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, when Samuel was offering up the ascending-sacrifice, the Philistines, drew near to fight against Israel,but Yahweh thundered with a great noise throughout that day, over the Philistines, and confused them, and they were smitten before Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of Israel went forth out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines,and smote them as far as under Beth-car.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel took a certain stone, and set it between Mizpah and Yeshanah, and called the name thereof Eben-ezer,and said, Hitherto, hath Yahweh helped us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Philistines were subdued, and, no more, came within the boundary of Israel,and the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines, all the days of Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even as far as Gath; even the boundaries thereof, did Israel rescue out of the hand of the Philistines,thus came there to be peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel judged Israel, all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he used to take his journey, from year to year, and go round to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpah,and used to judge Israel, at all these places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, his returning, was to Ramah, for, there, was his house, and, there, judged he Israel,so he built there an altar unto Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
