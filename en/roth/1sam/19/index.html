Wherefore, then, shouldst thou sin against innocent blood by putting David to death, without cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan,and Saul sware, By the life of Yahweh, he shall not be put to death!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jonathan called for David, and Jonathan told him all these things,and Jonathan brought in David unto Saul, and so he was in his presence, as aforetime.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, when the war again brake out,and David went forth and fought with the Philistines, and smote them with a great smiting, and they fled before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then came there a sad spirit of Yahweh unto Saul, he being in his house, seated, with his spear in his hand,while, David, played with his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Saul sought to smite David with the spear, even to the wall, but he slipped away from before Saul, who smote the spear into the wall,whereas, David, fled and escaped, that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Saul sent messengers unto Davids house, to watch him, and to put him to death, in the morning! And Michal his wife told David, saying, If thou do not deliver thyself to-night, to-morrow, art thou to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Michal let down David, through the window, and he departed and fled, and escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Michal took the household god, and put it in the bed, and, a fly-net of goats-hair, put she at its head,and covered it with the clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, when Saul sent messengers to take David, she saidHe is, sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Saul sent messengers to see David, saying,Bring him up in the bed unto me, that I may put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, when the messengers entered, lo! the household god in the bed,with a fly-net of goats-hair at its head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said unto MichalWherefore, in this way, hast thou deceived me, and let go mine enemy, that he hath escaped? Then said Michal unto Saul, He, himself, said unto meLet me go, wherefore should I put thee to death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So, David, fled, and escaped, and came in unto Samuel in Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him,and he and Samuel departed, and dwelt in Naioth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it was told Saul, saying,Lo! David, is in Naioth, in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Saul sent messengers to take David, but, when they saw the assembly of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, then came the Spirit of God upon the messengers of Saul, and, they also, were, moved to prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, when they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, then were, they also, moved to prophesy. And, when Saul again sent messengers a third time, then were, they also, moved to prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then went, he also himself, to Ramah, and came in as far as the well of the threshing-floor which is in Sephi, and asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one saidLo! in Naioth, in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, when he departed from thence towards Naioth in Ramah, then came upon, him also, the Spirit of God, and he went on and on, and was moved to prophesy, until he entered Naioth in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, even he, stripped off his upper garments, and, even he, was moved to prophesy before Samuel, and lay prostrate, disrobed, all that day, and all the night. For this cause, do they say, Is, even Saul, among the prophets?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
