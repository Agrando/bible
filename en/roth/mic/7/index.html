Every manfor his brother, do they hunt as for one devoted to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Of wickedness with both hands to make sure, the ruler, doth make demandand the judgefor a recompense,and, as for the great man, he, is putting into words the desire of his soul, So have they woven the net!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The best of them, is as a sharp briar, and, the most upright, worse than a thorn hedge, The day of thy watchmenof thy visitation, hath come, Now, shall be their confusion!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do not trust in a friend, do not put confidence in an associate,from her that lieth in thy bosom, keep thou the doors of thy mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For, the son, treateth as foolish, the father, and, the daughter, riseth up against, her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,The foes of a man, are the men of his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, I, for Yahweh, will watch, I will wait for the God of my salvation,My God, will hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not rejoice, O mine enemy, against me, Though I fall, I shall rise again!
