And Yahweh must tell thee that, a house, will Yahweh make for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall be that, when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, then will I raise up thy seed after thee, which proceedeth from thine own body,and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He, shall build a house for my name,and I will establish his kingly throne unto times age-abiding:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I, will become his father, And, he, shall become my son: If he commit iniquity, then will I correct him, with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, my lovingkindness, shall not depart from him,as I caused it to depart from Saul, whom I caused to depart from before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So shall thy house and thy kingdom be made steadfast unto times age-abiding, before thee,thy throne, shall be established unto times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so, spake Nathan unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then entered King David, and tarried before Yahweh,and saidWho am, I, My Lord, Yahweh, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me, hitherto;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and hast yet further made this seem little in thine eyes, My Lord, Yahweh, in that thou hast spoken, even of the house, of thy servant, for a great while to come? This, then is the law of manhood, O My Lord, Yahweh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>What more, then, can David yet further speak unto thee,seeing that, thou thyself knowest thy servant, O My Lord Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the sake of thine own word, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this great thing,making it known unto thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For this cause, hast thou magnified thyself, O Yahweh Elohim,for there is none like unto, thee, yea there is no God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, then, is like thy people, like Israel, a nation alone in the earth? whom God went to redeem for himself as a people, so to make himself a name, and to do for you the great deed, fearful things also for thy land, to make way for thy people, whom thou hadst redeemed for thyself, out of Egypt,   nations and their gods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and hast established for thyself thy people Israelfor thyself as a people, unto times age-abiding,thou thyself, also, O Yahweh, becoming their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, therefore, O Yahweh Elohim, the word which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou, unto times age-abiding,and do, as thou hast spoken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that thy name may be age-abidingly magnified, saying, Yahweh of hosts, is God over Israel, and so, the house of thy servant David, be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, thou, O Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, hast unveiled the ear of thy servant, sayingA house, will I build for thee. For this cause, hath thy servant found in his heart, to pray unto thee, this prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now, therefore, O My Lord, Yahweh, thou, art God, and, thy words, shall prove true,therefore hast thou spoken unto thy servant this goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, therefore, be pleased to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue age-abidingly before thee,for, thou, O My Lord, Yahweh, hast spoken, therefore, with thine own blessing, shall the house of thy servant be age-abidingly blessed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
