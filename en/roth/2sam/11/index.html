So Joab sent Uriah unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, when Uriah had come in unto him, David askedhow Joab prospered, and how the people prospered, and how the war prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said David unto Uriah, Go down unto thy house, and bathe thy feet. And, when Uriah went out of the house of the king, there followed him, a present from the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Uriah slept at the entrance of the kings house, with all the servants of his lord,and went not down unto his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it was told David, saying, Uriah went not down, unto his own house. So David said unto UriahWas it not, from a journey, thou didst come? why, then, hast thou not been down unto thine own house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Uriah said unto DavidThe ark, and Israel and Judah, are dwelling in huts and, my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, on the face of the field, are encamped, Was, I, then, to enter my own house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? By thy life, yea by the life of thy soul, I could not do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said David unto UriahAbide here to-day also, and, to-morrow, will I let thee go. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David called him, and he did eat before him, and drank, and he made him drunk,and he went forth in the evening to lie down on his bed, with the servants of his lord, but, unto his own house, went he not down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And so it was, in the morning, that David wrote a letter unto Joab,and sent it by the hand of Uriah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he wrote in the letter, saying,Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he be smitten and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it came to pass, when Joab was laying siege to the city, that he put Uriah in the place where he knew that the men of valour, were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And forth sallied the men of the city, and fought with Joab, and there fell some of the people, of the servants of David,then died also, Uriah the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Joab sent and told David all the news of the battle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he charged the messenger saying,When thou hast ended all the news of the battle, in speaking unto the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>then shall it be, if the kings anger arise, and he say unto thee, Why came ye near unto the city, to fight? Knew ye not, that they would shoot from off the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who smote Abimelech son of Jerubbaal? Did not, a woman, cast on him an upper millstone from off the wall, that he died, in Thebez? Wherefore came ye near unto the wall? Then shalt thou sayMoreover, thy servant, Uriah the Hittite, died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the messenger went his way,and came in, and told David, all that Joab had sent him   .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the messenger said unto David, The men were too strong for us, and sallied forth against us, in the field,so we were drawn against them as far as the opening of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then did the archers shoot upon thy servants, from off the wall, and there died some of the servants of the king,moreover also, thy servant, Uriah the Hittite, died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said David unto the messengerThus, shalt thou say unto Joab,Let not this thing be grievous in thine eyes, for, now this one, and then that one, doth the sword devour,make hot thy battle against the city, and overthrow it; Thus embolden thou him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, when Uriahs wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made loud lamentation over her lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, when the time of mourning had passed, David sent and received her into his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing which David had done was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
