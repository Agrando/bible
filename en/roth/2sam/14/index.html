And Joab put the words in her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, when the woman of Tekoa came in unto the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did homage,and saidSave, O king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king said to herWhat aileth thee? And she saidOf a truth, a widow woman, am I, for my husband is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, thy maidservant, had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, with none to tear them apart,so the one smote the other, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo! therefore, all the family hath risen up against thy maidservant, and have said: Give up him that hath smitten his brother, that we may put him to death, for the life of his brother, whom he hath slain, that we may destroy, the heir also. So will they quench my ember that is left, and make my husband without name or remainder, on the face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king said unto the womanGo to thy house, and, I, will give command concerning thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said the woman of Tekoa unto the king, Upon me, my lord, O king, be the iniquity, and upon the house of my father, but, the king and his throne, be guiltless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said,He that speaketh unto thee, bring him in unto me, and he shall, no more, annoy thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said she: Let the king, I pray thee, remember Yahweh thy God; so that the blood-redeemer may not make utter ruin, and that they destroy not my son. And he saidBy the life of Yahweh, not one hair of thy son shall fall to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said the woman, Pray let thy maidservant speak unto my lord the king, a word. And he saidSpeak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman said, Wherefore, then, hast thou devised the like of this, for the people of God; and yet the king, in speaking this word, is verily guilty, unless the king, bring back his fugitive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, when we, die, we become as water poured on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again,therefore doth God not take away the life, but deviseth plans so as not to thrust out from him, a fugitive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now, therefore,   that I have come to speak unto the king my lord this word, because the people kept putting me in fear,so thy maidservant saidDo let me, I pray you, speak unto the king! peradventure the king will fulfil the request of his handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the king can hearken, to rescue his handmaid out of the power of the man who would seek to destroy both me and my son together, out of the inheritance of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So thy maidservant said, Pray let the word of my lord the king be comforting,for, as the messenger of God, so is my lord the king, in hearing the good and the bad, Yahweh thy God, then, be with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then responded the king, and said unto the woman, Nay, now! do not hide from me, the thing which I am about to ask thee. And the woman said, Pray let my lord the king speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said the king, Is, the hand of Joab, with thee, in all this? And the woman answered and saidBy the life of thy soul, my lord, O king, there is no way to the right or to the left, of anything that my lord the king hath spoken, for, thy servant Joab himself, charged me, and, himself, put, in the mouth of thy maidservant, all these words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the purpose of turning round the face of the matter, hath thy servant Joab done this thing,my lord being wise, as with the wisdom of a messenger of God, in knowing all that is</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said the king unto Joab, See, I pray thee, I a have done this thing,go thenbring back the young man, Absolom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Joab fell with his face to the earth, and did homage, and blessed the king,and Joab saidTo-day, doth thy servant know, that I have found favour in thine eyes, my lord O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joab arose, and went to Geshur,and brought Absolom to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king saidLet him go round to his own house, and, my face, let him not see. So Absolom went round, unto his own house, and, the face of the king, saw he not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, like unto Absolom, was there no man handsome in all Israel, to be greatly praised,from the sole of his foot, even unto the crown of his head, there was not, in him, a blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he polled his headand it was at every years end that he used to poll it, because it was heavy upon him, therefore he used to poll ithe would weigh the hair of his head, two hundred shekels, by the royal standard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there were born to Absolom three sons, and one daughter, whose name, was Tamar,she, was a woman beautiful to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Absolom dwelt in Jerusalem two years of days,and, the face of the king, had he not seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then sent Absolom unto Joab, to send him unto the king, but he would not come to him,so he sent yet a second time, but he would not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then said he unto his servantsSee, the allotted portion of Joab, adjoineth me, and, he, hath barley there, go, and set it on fire. So the servants of Absolom set the portion on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then rose Joab, and went unto Absolom, in his house,and said unto him, Wherefore, have thy servants set the portion that pertaineth to me, on fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Absolom said unto JoabLo! I sent unto thee, sayingCome hither, that I may send thee unto the king, sayingWherefore, am I come from Geshur? I, might as well have yet been there. Now, therefore, let me see the face of the king, and, if there is in me iniquity, then let him put me to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Joab came unto the king, and told him, and the king called for Absolom, and he came in unto the king, and bowed himself down with his face to the ground, before the king,and the king kissed Absolom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
