And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel, am I escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David said unto himHow turned out the matter? tell me, I pray thee. And he saidThe people have fled from the battle, yea moreover, many, of the people have fallen, and died, Yea moreover, Saul, and Jonathan his son, are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said David unto the young man who was telling him,How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man who was telling him said, It, so happened, that I was on Mount Gilboa, when lo! Saul, leaning upon his spear, and lo! the chariots and horsemen, hotly pursued him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so he turned behind him, and saw me,and cried out unto me, and I said, Behold me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I said unto him, An Amalekite, am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto me, I pray thee, take thy stand by me, and put me to death, for the cramp hath seized me,even for as long as my life shall be in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I took my stand by him, and put him to death, for I perceived that he could not survive his fall,so I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them in unto my lord, here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David took hold of his clothes, and rent them,yea moreover,   all the men who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they lamented aloud, and wept, and fasted until the evening,for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said unto the young man who was telling him, Whence art thou? And he said, Son of a sojourneran Amalekite, am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said unto him,How wast thou not afraid to thrust forth thy hand, to destroy the Anointed of Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So David called one of the young men, and said,Go nearfall upon him. And he smote him, that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said unto him, Thy blood, be upon thine own head,for, thine own mouth, hath testified against thee, saying, I myself, put to death the Anointed of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then chanted David this dirge,over Saul and over Jonathan his son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he thought to teach the sons of Judah   the Bow,lo! it is written in the Book of the Upright:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The beauty of Israel! on thy high plumesslain! How have fallenthe mighty!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not tell it in Gath, Do not publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the Uncircumcised triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye mountains in Gilboa! Be there neither dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings,for, there, were cast away, the shields of the mighty, The shield of Saul, unanointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan neer drew back,and, the sword of Saul, neer returned, empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan, delightfully loving in their lives, even, in their death, were not divided,Beyond eagles, were they swift, beyond lions, were they strong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye daughters of Israel! For Saul, weep ye,who clothed you in crimson,   with lovely things, who hung ornaments of gold on your apparel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How have fallen the mighty, in the midst of the battle! Jonathan, on thy high places, slain!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for thee, my brother, Jonathan! Delightful to me, exceedingly,Wonderful, was thy love to me, passing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How have fallen the mighty, and perished the weapons of war!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
