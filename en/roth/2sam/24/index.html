Or, for three months, wilt thou flee before thine enemies while, they, pursue thee? Or shall there be, for three days, pestilence in thy land? Now, consider and see, what, answer, I shall return to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said unto GadI am in a great strait,let us fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Yahweh, for, manifold, are, his compassions, but, into the hand of man, let me not fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Yahweh sent forth a pestilence throughout Israel, from the morning even unto the time appointed,and there died of the people, from Dan even unto Beer-sheba, seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, when the messenger stretched out his hand towards Jerusalem, to destroy it, then relented Yahweh as to the evil, and he said to the messenger who was destroying the peopleEnough! now, stay thy hand. And, the messenger of Yahweh, was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said David unto Yahweh, when he saw the messenger who was smiting the people, yea he saidLo! I, have sinned, and, I, have done perversely, but what have, these sheep, done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against the house of my father!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Gad came unto David, on that day,and said unto himGo up, rear thou unto Yahweh an altar, in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So David went up, according to the word of Gad, as Yahweh had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Araunah looked out, and saw the king, and his servants, passing over unto himso Araunah went forth, and did homage unto the king, with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Araunah, Wherefore, hath my lord the king come unto his servant? And David saidTo buy of thee the threshing-floor, to build an altar unto Yahweh, that the plague may be stayed from off the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said Araunah unto David, Let my lord the king accept it and cause to ascend what is good in his own eyes,see! the oxen for the ascending-sacrifice, and the threshing-sledges and ox-yokes for wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The whole, did Araunah give, as a king to a king. And Araunah said unto the king, Yahweh thy God, accept thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the king said unto AraunahNay! but I will, buy, it of thee, for a price, and will not cause to ascend unto Yahweh my God, offerings that have cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor, and the oxen, for fifty shekels of silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and David built there an altar unto Yahweh, and caused to go up ascending-sacrifices and peace-offerings,then was Yahweh entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
