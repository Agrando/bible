David therefore went and brought up the ark of God, out of the house of Obed-edom, unto the city of David, with rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And so it was that, when they who bare the ark of Yahweh had stepped forward six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a heifer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, David, was dancing with all boldness before Yahweh,David, being girt with an ephod of linen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So, David and all the house of Israel, were bringing up the ark of Yahweh,with triumphant shoutings, and with the sound of a horn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it so came about that, when the ark of Yahweh entered the city of David, Michal Sauls daughter, looked out through the window, and saw King David, leaping and dancing before Yahweh, and she despised him, in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent which David had stretched out for it,and David caused to go up ascending-sacrifices before Yahweh, and peace-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, when David had finished offering up the ascending-sacrifice and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he apportioned to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, both to men and to womento every one, a loaf of bread, and a sweet drink, and a raisin-cake,and all the people went their way, every one unto his own house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and David returned, to bless his household. Then came forth Michal Sauls daughter to meet David, and saidHow honoured, to-day, was the king of Israel in disrobing himself to-day, in the sight of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the low people, might disrobe himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David said unto Michal, Before Yahweh, I will dance,blessed, be Yahweh, who made choice of me above thy father, and above all his house, putting me in charge as leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel,therefore will I dance before Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and will make myself, yet more, lightly esteemed that this, and become lowly in mine own eyes,nevertheless, with the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, with them, shall I be honoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, Michal Sauls daughter, had no child,unto the day of her death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
