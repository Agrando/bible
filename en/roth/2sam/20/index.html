Now, Joab, was girded about with his war-coat as his upper garment, and, over it, a girdle with a sword, fastened upon his loins, in the sheath thereof, and, it, came out and fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Joab unto Amasa, Art thou, well, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand, to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Amasa not heeding the sword that was in the hand of Joab, he smote him therewith in the belly, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and   him not again, and he died. So, Joab and Abishai his brother, pursued Sheba son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, a man, stood over him, of the young men of Joab,and saidWhosoever is well pleased with Joab, and whosoever pertaineth to David, let him follow Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, Amasa, was wallowing in blood, in the midst of the highway,and, when the man saw that all the people stood still, he moved Amasa, out of the highway into the field, and cast over him a garment, as soon as he saw that every man that came up to him stood still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he had removed him out of the highway, every man passed on, after Joab, to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he passed on throughout all the tribes of Israel, unto Abel and unto Beth-maachah, and all the Berites,and they were called together, and came in, yea and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they came, and laid siege against him, in Abel, Beth-maachah, and they cast up a mound against the city, so that it stood within a rampart, and, all the people who were with Joab, were battering the wall to throw it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then cried a wise woman out of the city,Hear ye! hear ye! I pray you, say unto Joab, Come near hither, and let me speak unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he came near unto her, and the woman said,Art thou Joab? And he said,I am. And she said unto him,Hear thou the words of thy handmaid. And he said, I do hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then spake she, saying,They, used to speak, in former times, saying, Enquire, in Abel! And, so, they ended it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I, am of the peaceable among the faithful in Israel,thou, art seeking to put to death a city, and a mother in Israel, wherefore wouldst thou swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then answered Joab and said,Far be it! far be it from me! I will neither swallow up nor lay waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not so, is the matter! but, a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba son of Bichri, his name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David, give up him alone, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Lo! his head, shall be cast unto thee, through the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the woman came unto all the people in her wisdom, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri, and cast it out unto Joab. And he blew with a horn, and they dispersed themselves from the city, every man to his home; but, Joab, returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, Joab, was   unto all the army of Israel,And, Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, Adoniram, was over the tribute,And, Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the remembrancer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, Sheva, was scribe,And, Zadok and Abiathar, were priests;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover also, Ira the Jairite, was chief ruler unto David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
