Thus, saith Yahweh, God of IsraelI, anointed thee to be king over Israel, and, I, delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and gave unto thee the household of thy lord, and the wives of thy lord, into thy bosom, and gave unto thee the house of Israel and Judah. And, if this had been too little, I could have further given thee more and more of such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Wherefore, hast thou despised the word of Yahweh, by doing that which is wicked in mine eyes? Uriah the Hittite, hast thou smitten with the sword, and, his wife, hast thou taken to thyself to wife, yea, him, hast thou slain with the sword of the sons of Ammon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now, therefore, the sword shall not depart from thy house, unto age-abiding times,because thou hast despised me, and taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus, saith Yahweh,Behold me! raising up over thee calamity out of thine own household, and I will take thy wives, before thine eyes, and give unto thy neighbour, and he will lie with thy wives, in the eyes of this sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For, thou, didst it, in secret,but, I, will do this thing, before all Israel, and before the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Yahweh. Then said Nathan unto David,Yahweh also, hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless, because thou hast greatly blasphemed Yahweh, by this thing, the very son that is born to thee, shall, die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Nathan departed unto his own house,and Yahweh struck the child that the wife of Uriah had borne unto David, and it fell sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David therefore earnestly sought God in behalf of the boy,and David kept a fast, and used to go in and pass the night, and lie upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the elders of his house stood up over him, to raise him from the ground,but he would not, neither would he eat food with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, on the seventh day, that the child died,but the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead, for said theyLo! while the child was living, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice, how then can we say unto him, The child is dead, and so he do   harm?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, when David saw that his servants were whispering among themselves, then understood David that the child was dead,and David said unto his servantsIs the child, dead? And they answeredDead!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David arose from the ground, and bathed and anointed, and changed his apparel, and, entering into the house of Yahweh, bowed himself down,then came he into his own house, and asked, and they set before him food, and he did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said his servants unto him, What is this thing that thou hast done? For the childs sake, while living, thou didst fast and weep, but, as soon as the child was dead, thou didst arise and eat food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said,While yet the child lived, I fasted, and wept,for I saidWho knoweth whether Yahweh may not grant me favour, and the child live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, now, that he is dead, wherefore should I go on fasting? can I bring him back again? I am going unto him, but, he, will not come back unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David consoled Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her,and she bare a son, and called his name, Solomon, and Yahweh loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name Jedidiah, for Yahwehs sake. \fs15</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joab fought against Rabbah, of the sons of Ammon,and captured the royal city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Joab sent messengers unto David,and saidI have fought against Rabbah, I have also captured the city of the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now, therefore, gather thou together the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and capture it,lest, I, capture the city, and it be called by my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So David gathered together all the people, and went to Rabbah,and fought against it, and captured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then took he the crown of Milcom from off his head, the weight thereof, being a talent of gold, with the precious stones, and it remained on the head of David,the spoil of the city also, brought he forth in great abundance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the people also that were therein, brought he forth, and put them to the saw, and to threshing sledges of iron, and to axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln, and thus used he to do unto all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
