But, as for the lame and the blind, they were the hated of Davids soul,for which cause, they kept on saying, Blind and lame! he will not enter the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then David dwelt in the citadel, and called it, The City of David,and David built round about, from Millo and inwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David went on and on waxing great,Yahweh, God of hosts, being with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers unto David, with cedar-wood, and carpenters, and masons, and they built a house for David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So David perceived that Yahweh had established him to be king over Israel,and that he had exalted his kingdom, for the sake of his people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took him yet more concubines and wives, out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron, and there were, yet further, born unto David, sons and daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now, these, are the names of the sons who were born unto him in Jerusalem,Shammua and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Yaphia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Elishama and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, when the Philistine heard that they had anointed David to be king over Israel, then came up all the Philistines to seek to secure David, and David heard of it, and went down into the citadel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now, the Philistines, had come,and had spread themselves out in the vale of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then David enquired of Yahweh, saying,Shall I go up against the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Yahweh said unto DavidGo up; for I, will surely deliver, the Philistines into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David entered Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and saidYahweh hath broken forth upon mine enemies, before me, like a breaking forth of waters. For this cause, called he the name of that place, Baal-perazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they left their images there,and David and his men took them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, yet again, did the Philistines come up, and they spread themselves out in the vale of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So David enquired of Yahweh, and he saidThou shalt not go up,Get round behind them, and come in upon them, over against the mulberry-trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, then, shalt thou act with decision,for, then, will Yahweh have gone forth before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did so, as Yahweh had commanded him,and smote the Philistines, from Gibeon until thou enterest Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
