Ziba, servant of Mephibosheth, met him,with a couple of asses saddled, and, upon them, two hundred cakes of bread, and one hundred cakes of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou, by these? And Ziba saidThe asses, are for the kings household, to ride on, and, the bread and the summer fruits, are for the young men to eat, and, the wine, is for drink to such as are faint in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then said the king, And where is thy lords son? And Ziba said unto the kingLo! abiding in Jerusalem, for he said, To-day, will the house of Israel, restore unto me, the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said the king unto Ziba, Lo! thine, is all that pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba saidI have done homage, that I might find favour in thine eyes, my lord O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, when King David had come as far as Bahurim, lo! from thence a man coming out, of the family of the house of Saul, whose name, was Shimei son of Gera, coming out and cursing as he came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he pelted, with stones, David and all the servants of King David,all the people, and all the mighty men, being on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, thus, said Shimei, when he cursed,Out! Out! thou man of bloodshed, and man of the Abandoned One!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yahweh, hath brought back upon thee, all the shed-blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned, and Yahweh hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absolom thy son,and, here thou art, in thy ruin, for that, a man of bloodshed, thou art.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Abishai, son of Zeruiah, unto the kingWherefore should this dead dog curse my lord the king? I pray thee, let me cross over and take off his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the king said, What have I in common with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? thus, he curseth, because, Yahweh, hath said unto himCurse David. Who then can say, Why hast thou done thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said David unto Abishai, and unto all his servants, Lo! my own son who sprang from my body, is seeking my life,then how much more, now, a Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse, for, Yahweh, hath permitted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be, that Yahweh will behold with his eye,and that Yahweh will return me good, for his cursing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, when David and his men went along in the way, Shimei, was going along on the side of the hill over against him, cursing as he went, pelting him with stones, and throwing dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king and all the people that were with him arrived, weary,and they refreshed themselves there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, Absolom and all the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem,and Ahithophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, the friend of David, came in unto Absolom, that Hushai said unto Absolom: Long live the king! Long live the king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Absolom unto Hushai, Is, this, thy lovingkindness unto thy friend? Wherefore wentest thou not with thy friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Hushai said unto Absolom, Nay! but, whom Yahweh, and all this people, and the men of Israel have chosen, his, will I be, and, with him, will I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, again, whom, should, I serve? Should it not be in presence of his son? as I served in presence of thy father, so, will I continue thy presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said Absolom unto Ahithophel,Give ye your counsel, what we shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ahithophel said unto Absolom, Go in unto thy fathers concubines, whom he hath left to keep the house,so shall all Israel hear that thou hast made thyself odious unto thy father, and the hands of all that are with thee, shall be strengthened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they stretched out for Absolom a tent, upon the house-top,and Absolom went in unto his fathers concubines, in the sight of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, the counsel of Ahithophel which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God,so, was all the counsel of Ahithophel, both to David, and also to Absolom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
