Yahweh, indeed, had given charge to frustrate the wise counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring upon Absolom, ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Hushai said unto Zadok and unto Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus, did Ahithophel counsel Absolom and the elders of Israel,and, thus and thus, have, I, counselled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, therefore, send quickly, and tell David, saying,Do not lodge to-night in the waste plains of the wilderness, thou must, even pass over, lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, were staying by En-rogel, and a maidservant was to go and tell them, and, they, were to go and tell King David,for they might not be seen to eater the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, though a young man did see them, and told Absolom, yet they both departed quickly, and entered the house of a man in Bahurim, and, he, had a well in his court, into which they went down;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the woman took and spread the cover over the face of the well, and spread thereon her pounded corn,so nothing was known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came the servants of Absolom unto the woman in the house, and saidWhere are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to themThey have passed over the stream of water. And, when they had searched and not found, they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, after those had gone, that these came up out of the well, and went, and told King David,and said unto David,Arise ye and pass quickly over the water, for, thus and thus, hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So David arose, and all the people who were with him, and passed over the Jordan, by the morning light, so much as one, was not lacking, who had not passed over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, when, Ahithophel, saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose and went unto his own house, unto his own city, and gave charge unto his household, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the grave of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When, David, had come to Mahanaim, Absolom, had passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Absolom had appointed, Amasa, instead of Joab, over the army,Amasa, being the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Ishmaelite, who went in unto Abigail, daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Israel and Absolom encamped in the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when David entered Mahanaim, that Shobi son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon and Machir son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite, of Rogelim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>brought, sleeping rugs, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat and barley, and meal and roasted corn,and beans and lentils, and parched pulse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and honey and cream, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat,for they said, The people, are hungry and weary and thirsty, in the wilderness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
