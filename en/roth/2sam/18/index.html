Then said the king, unto the people, I myself, will, surely go forth, with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the people saidThou must not go forth, for, if we, flee, they will not regard us, neither, if half of us die, will they regard us, for, thou, compared with us,   ten thousand,now, therefore, it will be better that thou come to us out of the city, with succour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said unto them, Whatever is best in your eyes, I will do. And the king stood beside the gate, while, all the people, came out by hundreds and by thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king charged Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently, for my sake, with the young man, even Absolom. And, all the people, heard when the king charged all the captains, for the sake of Absolom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the people went forth into the field against Israel,and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then were the people of Israel defeated there, before he servants of David,and the slaughter there was great, on that daytwenty thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the battle there was spread out over the face of all the land,and the forest devoured more of the people than the sword devoured on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, when Absolom met the servants of David, Absolom, was riding upon a mule, and the mule came under the thick branches of a large oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth, the mule that was under him passing on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab,and saidLo! I saw Absolom suspended in an oak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Joab to the man that was telling him, Lo! since thou sawest him, why didst thou not smite him there, to the ground? then should I have been bound to give thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said unto Joab, Though I were weighing upon my palm a thousand pieces of silver, yet would I not put forth my hand against the son of the king,for, in our hearing, the king Charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Watch any man who   the young man Absolom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Otherwise, had I dealt with my life falsely (and nothing can be hid from the king), then, thou thyself, wouldst have stood aloof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joab said, Not thus, may I tarry before thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absolom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then came round ten young men who bare Joabs armour,and smote Absolom, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Joab blew with a horn, and the people returned from pursuing Israel,for Joab had restrained the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they took Absolom, and cast him, in the forest, into a large pit, and raised up over him a very great heap of stones,and, all Israel, fled, every man to his home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, Absolom, had taken, and raised up for himself, in his lifetime, the pillar that is in the kings vale, for he said, I have no son, to keep in remembrance my name, so he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absoloms monument unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, Ahimaaz, son of Zadok, said, Let me run, I pray thee, and carry tidings unto the king,how that Yahweh hath vindicated him, at the hand of his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joab said to himNot a man to bear tidings, art thou this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day,but, this day, shalt thou not bear tidings, for this cause, that, the kings son, is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Joab to a Cushite, Go tell the king, what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself down to Joab, and ran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then, yet again, said Ahimaaz son of Zadok unto Joab. But, be what may, do, I pray thee, let, me also, run, after the Cushite. And Joab saidWherefore is it that, thou, wouldst run, my son, when, thou, hast no tidings of, any profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, be what may, I will run. So he said to himRun. Then ran Ahimaaz by the way of the plain, and got beyond the Cushite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, David, was sitting between the two gates,and the watchman went on to the top of the gate-house, upon the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and lo! a man, running alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the watchman called out, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there are tidings in his mouth. And he came on nearer and nearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then saw the watchman another man, running, so he called out unto the porter, Lo! a man, running alone. And the king said. This one also, beareth tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then said the watchman, It seemeth, to me, that, the running of the foremost, is like the running of Ahimaaz son of Zadok. And the king said, A good man, is he, and, with good tidings, he cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then called out Ahimaaz, and said unto the king, Peace! And he bowed himself down to the king, with his face to the earth,and saidBlessed, be Yahweh thy God, who hath surrendered the men who were lifting up their hand, against my lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king said, Is it, well, with the young manAbsolom? Then said AhimaazI saw a great crowd, when Joab sent the kings servant and   .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king said, Aside! stand, here. So he turned aside, and stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then lo! the Cushite, coming in,and the Cushite saidTidings, getteth my lord the king, how that Yahweh hath vindicated thee to-day, at the hand of all them who had risen up against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the king said unto the CushiteIs it, well, with the young manAbsolom? Then said the CushiteBe, like the young man, the enemies of my lord the king, and all who have risen up against thee, for harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then was the king deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept,and, thus, he said as he wentO my son Absolom, my sonmy sonAbsolom! could, I, but have died in thy stead, O Absolom, my sonmy son!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
