These, were born unto David, in Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, while the war continued between the house of Saul and the house of David, that, Abner, shewed himself courageous for the house of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, Saul, had a concubine, whose name, was Rizpah daughter of Aiah,and   said unto Abner, Why, wentest thou in, unto my fathers concubine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it provoked Abner greatly, on account of the words of Ish-bosheth, and he saidAm I, the head of the dogs, that pertain unto Judah? To-day, would I deal in lovingkindness with the house of Saul thy father, towards his brethren, and towards his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David,and yet thou hast charged upon me the transgression of the woman, today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So, may God do unto Abner, and, so, may he add to him,if, as Yahweh hath sworn unto David, even so, I deal not with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>by turning over the kingdom from the house of Saul,and establishing the throne of David, over Israel and over Judah, from Dan, even unto Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he could no further answer Abner, a word,because he feared him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Abner sent messengers unto David, on the spot, sayingWhose, is the land? Saying   Solemnise thy covenant with me; and lo! my hand, shall be with thee, to bring round unto thee, all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he saidGood! I, will solemnise with thee a covenant,but, one thing, must I ask of thee, sayingThou shalt not see my face, except thou have brought in Michal, Sauls daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David sent messengers unto Ish-bosheth son of Saul, saying,Give up my wife, Michal, whom I espoused to myself, for a hundred foreskins of Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband,from Paltiel, son of Laish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And her husband went along with her, weeping as he went behind her, as far as Behurim,when Abner said unto himGo, return. And he returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then had Abner, speech, with the elders of Israel, saying,In times past, ye were seeking David, to be king over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now, therefore, act,for Yahweh, spake unto David, saying, By the hand of David my servant, will I save my people Israel, out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin, and Abner also went to speak in the ears of David, in Hebron, all that was pleasing in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So, when Abner came in unto David, in Hebron, and, with him, twenty men, David made, for Abner, and for the men who were with him, a banquet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Abner unto DavidI will verily arise and go, and gather together unto my lord the king, all Israelthat they may solemnise with thee a covenant, so shalt thou reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David let Abner go, and he departed in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And lo! the servants of David, and Joab, came in from a raid, and, great spoil, brought they in with them; but, Abner, was not with David in Hebron, for he had let him go, and he had departed in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When, Joab, and all the host that was with him, had come in, then told they Joab, saying, Abner son of Ner hath been in unto the king, and he hath let him go, and he hath departed in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Joab came in unto the king, and saidWhat hast thou done? Lo! Abner came in unto thee. Wherefore is it that thou didst let him go, so that he is clean departed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou knowest Abner son of Ner, that, to deceive thee, he came,and to take knowledge of thy going out, and thy coming in, and to take knowledge of all that thou art doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and brought him back from the well of Sirah,but, David, knew it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Abner returned to Hebron, and Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate, to speak with him quietly,and then smote him there, in the belly, that he died, for the blood of Asahel the brother of Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, when David heard of it, after that, he saidGuiltless, am I and my kingdom before Yahweh, unto times age-abiding,of the blood of Abner son of Ner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let it be hurled upon the head of Joab, and against all his fathers house,and let there not fail from the house of Joabone that hath an issue, or a leper, or one that leaneth on a crutch, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus, Joab and Abishai his brother, slew Abner,because he had caused the death of Asahel their brother, in Gibeon, in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And David said unto Joab, and unto all the people who were with him,Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and lament aloud before Abner. And, King David himself, was following the bier.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they buried Abner in Hebron,and the king lifted up his voice and wept, at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king addressed his dirge unto Abner, and said,As a base man dieth, should Abner have died?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Thy hands, were not bound, And, thy feet, near to fetters, were not brought, As one falleth before assassins, so didst thou fall! And again all the people wept over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, when all the people came near to get David to eat bread, while yet it was day, David sware, sayingSo, let God do to me, and, so, let him add, if, before the sun go in, I taste bread, or anything else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, all the people, took note of it, and it was noble in their eyes,as, all that the king did, was, in the eyes of all the people, noble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So then all the people, and all Israel, took note, that day, that it was not of the king, to cause the death of Abner son of Ner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the king said unto his servants,Will ye not take note that, a prince and a great man, hath fallen this day, in Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, I myself, this day, am weak, though anointed king, but, these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I: Yahweh repay, the doer of wickedness, according to his wickedness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
