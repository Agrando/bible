I will prove thee with gladness, and look thou on blessedness,but lo! even that, was vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Of laughter, I said, Madness! and, of mirth, What can it do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I sought out with my heart, to cherish with wine, my flesh,but, my heart, was to guide with wisdom, even in laying hold of folly, until I should see which was blessedness for the sons of men, as to that which they could do, under the heavens, during the number of the days of their life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I enlarged my works,I built me houses, I planted me vineyards;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I made me gardens, and parks,I planted in them trees of every kind of fruit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I made me pools of water,to irrigate therefrom the thick-set saplings growing up into trees:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I acquired, men-servants and women-servants, and, the children of the household, were mine,also possessions, herds and flocks in abundance, were mine, beyond all who had been before me in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I heaped me up, both silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings, and provinces,I provided me singing-men and singing-women, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I became great, and increased, more than any one who had been before me in Jerusalem,moreover, my wisdom, remained with me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and, nothing that mine eyes asked, withheld I from them,I did not keep back my heart from any gladness, for, my heart, obtained gladness out of all my toil, and so, this, was my portion, out of all my toil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When, I, looked upon all my works, which my hands had made, and on my toil, whereon I had toilsomely wrought, then lo! all, was vanity, and feeding on wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus turned, I, to look at wisdom, and madness and folly,for what can the man   that which, already, men have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then saw, I, that wisdom doth excel folly,as far as light excelleth darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for the wise man, his eyes, are in his head, whereas, the dullard, in darkness, doth walk,but, I myself, knew that, one destiny, happeneth to them, all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said, I, in my heart, As it happeneth to the dullard, even to me, will it happen, but wherefore, then, became, I, wise to excess? Therefore spake I, in my heart, Even this, is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For there is no remembrance of a wise man, more than of a dullard, unto times age-abiding,seeing that, already, in the days to come, all hath been forgotten, how then cometh it that the wise man dieth equally with the dullard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I hated life, for, a vexation unto me, was the work which was done under the sun,for, all, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hated, I, all my toil, wherein I was toiling, under the sun,in that I should leave it for the man who should come after me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and who could know whether a, wise man, he would be or a foolish, and yet he would lord it over all my toil, wherein I had toiled and wherein I had acted wisely, under the sun,even this, was vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then resolved I, to give my heart over to despair,concerning all the toil, wherein I had toiled, under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For here is a man, whose toil hath been with wisdom and with knowledge and with skill,yet, to a man who hath not toiled therein, shall he leave it as his portion, even this, was vanity and a great vexation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what hath the man for all his toil, and for the striving of his heart,wherein, he himself, toiled under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, all his days, are pains, and, vexatious, is his employment, even in the night, his heart lieth not down,even this, was, vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There was nothing more blessed for Man   that he should eat and drink, and see his desireth for blessedness in his toil,even this, saw, I myself, that, from the hand of God, it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who could eat and who could enjoy, so well as I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For, to a man who is good before him, hath he given wisdom and knowledge and gladness,whereas, to the sinner, he hath given employment, to gather and heap up, to give to one who is good before God, even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
