I brought my son unto thee, having a dumb spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and, wheresoever it seizeth him, it teareth him, and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and weareth himself out;and I spake to thy disciples, that they should cast it out, and they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, he, answering, saithO faithless generation! how long, shall I be with you? how long, shall I bear with you? Bring him unto me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him unto him. And, seeing him, the spirit, straightway tare him,and, falling upon the ground, he wallowed, foaming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he questioned his fatherHow long a time, is it, that, this, hath befallen him? and he saidFrom childhood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and, many times, hath it cast him, both into fire, and into waters, that it might destroy him; but, if anything be possible to thee, help us, have compassion upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, Jesus, said unto himAs for this, If it be possible to thee, all things, are possible, to him who hath faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Straightway crying out, the father of the child was sayingI have faith! help my, want, of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus, seeing that a multitude is running together, rebuked the impure spirit, saying unto itThou dumb and deaf spirit, I, give orders unto thee: Come forth out of him, and do not, any more, enter into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, crying out, and greatly mangling him, it came forth; and he became as if dead, so that, the more part, were sayingHe is dead!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, Jesus, grasping his hand, raised him, and he stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, when he had gone into a house, his disciples, privately, were questioning himWhy, were, we, not able to cast it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said unto themThis kind, by nothing, can come out, save, by prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, from thence, going forth, they were journeying through Galilee,and he was not wishing that any should get to know it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for he was teaching his disciples and saying  unto them , The Son of Man, is to be delivered up, into the hands of men, and they will slay him,and, being slain, after three days, will he arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they were not understanding the declaration, and feared, to question, him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they came into Capernaum. And, happening to be, in the house, he was questioning themWhat, in the way, were ye discussing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they were silent; for, with one another, they had discussed in the way, who should be greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, taking a seat, he addressed the twelve, and saith unto themIf anyone willeth to be, first, he shall be, least of all, and, minister of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, taking a child, he set it in the midst of them,and, folding it in his arms, said unto them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whosoever, unto,  one of  these children, shall give welcome, upon my name, unto me, giveth welcome; and, whosoever, unto me, giveth welcome, not, unto me, giveth welcome, but, unto him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John said unto himTeacher! we saw someone, in thy name, casting out demons,and we forbade him, because he was not following with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But, Jesus, saidDo not forbid him! For, no one, is there, who shall do a work of power in my name, and have power, soon, to revile me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For, whosoever is not, against, us, is, for, us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For, whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water, in name that, Christs, ye are, Verily! I say unto you, in nowise, shall lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, whosoever shall cause to stumble one of these little ones that believe, it is, seemly, for him, rather, if there is hung a large millstone about his neck, and he is cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And, if thy hand shall cause thee to stumble, cut it off,it is, seemly, for thee, maimed, to enter into life, rather than having, the two hands, to depart into the gehenna, into the fire that is not quenched;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, if thy foot be causing thee to stumble, cut it off,it is, seemly, for thee, to enter into life, lame, rather than having, the two feet, to be cast into the gehenna;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, if thine eye be causing thee to stumble, thrust it out,it is, seemly, for thee, one-eye, to enter into the kingdom of God, rather than having, two eyes, to be cast into gehenna,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Where, their worm, dieth not, and, the fire, is not quenched,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For, everyone, with fire, shall be salted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Salt is, good: but, if, salt, become, saltless, wherewith will ye, prepare, it? Have, within yourselves, salt, and be at peace, one with another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
