Lo! the sower went forth to sow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some, indeed, fell by the pathway, and the birds came, and devoured it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, some, fell on the rocky places,  even  where it had not much earth,and, straightway, it sprang forth, by reason of its not having depth of earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and, when the sun arose, it was scorched,and, by reason of its not having root, it was dried up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, some, fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and, fruit, it yielded not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, other, fell into the good ground, and was yielding fruit, coming up and growing,and was bearing, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he was sayingHe that hath ears to hear, let him hear!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he was alone they who were about him with the twelve questioned him as to the parables;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and he was saying unto themTo you, the sacred secret hath been given of the kingdom of God, whereas, to them who are outside, in parables are all things coming to pass,that</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They may surely look and yet not see, and surely hear and yet not understand, lest once they should return and it be forgiven them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he saith unto themKnow ye not this parable? How then will ye get to know all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower, soweth the word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are they beside the pathway where the word is sown,and, as soon as they hear, straightway, cometh Satan, and snatcheth away the word which hath been sown into them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these are likewise they upon the rocky places sown,who, as soon as they hear the word, straightway, with joy receive it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and have no root in themselves, but, only for a season are,afterwards, when there ariseth tribulation or persecution by reason of the word, straightway, they find cause of stumbling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And others are they who among thorns are sown,these are they who hear the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and, the anxieties of the age, and the deceit of wealth, and the covetings about the remaining things, entering in, choke up the word, and, unfruitful, it becometh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those yonder are they who on the good ground are sown,who, indeed, hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruitthirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he was saying unto themDoth the lamp come that under the measure it should be put, or under the couch? Is it not that upon the lampstand it may be put?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is not hidden, save that it may be made visible; neither did it get hidden away, but that it might come into a place where it could be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he was saying unto themBe taking heed what ye are hearing:with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you, and added unto you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For, he that hath, it shall be given, unto him, and, he that hath not, even what he hath, shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he was sayingThus, is the kingdom of God: As a man may cast seed upon the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and be sleeping and rising, night and day,and the seed be sprouting, and lengthening itself,how, he, knoweth not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>of itself, the earth beareth fruit,first, a blade, afterwards, an ear, after that, full corn in the ear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but, as soon as the fruit yieldeth itself up, straightway, he sendeth forth the sickle, because standing by is the harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he was sayingHow shall we liken the kingdom of God, or, in what parable, shall we put it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As a grain of mustard seed,which, whensoever it may be sown upon the earth, is less than all the seeds that are upon the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and, as soon as it is sown, springeth up, and becometh greater than all garden plants, and produceth large branches, so that, under the shade thereof, the birds of heaven can find shelter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, with many such parables as these, was he speaking unto them the word,according as they were able to hear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but, without a parable, was he not speaking unto them,privately, however, unto his own disciples, was he explaining all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he saith unto them, on that day, when evening came, Let us cross over unto the other side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and, dismissing the multitude, they take him with them, as he was, in the boat, and, other boats, were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there ariseth a great tempest of wind,and, the waves, were dashing over into the boat, so that, already being filled, was the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he was in the stern, on the cushion, sleeping. And they arouse him, and say unto him, Teacher! carest thou not that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, roused up, he rebuked the wind, and said unto the seaHush! be still! and the wind lulled, and it became a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said unto themWhy, are ye, fearful? Not yet, have ye faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they were caused to fear a great fear, and were saying one to anotherWho then is, this, that, both the wind and the sea, give ear unto him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
