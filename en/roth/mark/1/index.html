I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A voice of one crying aloudIn the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight, be making his paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John the Immerser came, in the wilderness, proclaiming an immersion of repentance for remission of sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and there were going out unto him all the Judaea country and all they of Jerusalem, and were being immersed by him in the Jordan river, openly confessing their sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and John was clothed with camels-hair and a leathern girdle about his loins, and was eating locusts and wild honey;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he proclaimed, sayingHe that is mightier than I cometh after  me , of whom I am not worthy to stoop and unloose the strap of his sandals:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I, have immersed you, with water,He, will immerse you, with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass, in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed into the Jordan by John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, straightway, as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rending asunder, and, the Spirit, as a dove, descending unto him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and a voice  came  out of the heavensThou, art my Son, the Beloved,In thee, I delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, straightway, the Spirit urgeth him forth into the wilderness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he was in the wilderness, forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts,and, the messengers, were ministering unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the glad-message of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying The season is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God hath drawn near,Repent ye, and have faith in the glad-message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, passing by near the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea,for they were fishers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and Jesus said unto themCome after me, and I will make you become fishers of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and, straightway, leaving the nets, they followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, going forward a little, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, and them who were in the boat putting in order the nets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and, straightway, he called them,and, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat, with the hired men, they came away after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they journey into Capernaum. And, straightway, on the Sabbath, entering into the synagogue, he began teaching;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and they were being struck with astonishment at his teaching,for he was teaching them as one having authority, and, not as the Scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, straightway, there was in their synagogue, a man in an impure spirit,and he cried out aloud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>sayingWhat have we in common with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art, The Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him,  saying Be silenced, and come forth out of him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the impure spirit, tearing him, and calling out with a loud voice, came forth out of him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and they were amazed, one and all, so that they began to discuss among themselves, sayingWhat is this? New teaching! With authority, to the impure spirits also, he giveth orders, and they obey him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And forth went the report of him, straightway, on every hand, into the surrounding country of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, straightway, out of the synagogue, going forth, he went unto the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now, the mother-in-law of Simon, was lying in a fever, and, straightway, they speak to him concerning her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and, coming near, he raised her up, grasping her hand,and the fever left her, and she began ministering unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, evening arriving, when the sun went in, they were bearing unto him all who were sick, and them who were demonized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and all the city was gathered unto the door;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and he cured many that were sick with divers diseases, and, many demons, he cast out, and suffered not the demons to be talking,because they knew him  to be Christ .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, very early by night arising, he went out  and departed  into a desert place, and, there, was praying;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and Simon, and they who were with him, went in quest of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and found him, and say unto himAll, are seeking thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and he saith unto themLet us be going elsewhere, into the neighbouring country-towns, in order that, there also, I may be making proclamation,for, to this end, came I forth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and he came, making proclamation, into their synagogues, throughout the whole of Galilee,and, was casting the demons out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there cometh unto him, a leper, beseeching him and  kneeling ,saying unto himIf thou be willing, thou canst cleanse me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and, moved with compassion, he stretched forth the hand, and touched him, and saith unto himI am willing, Be cleansed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and, straightway, the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and, strictly charging him, straightway, he urged him forth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and saith unto himMind! unto no one, say aught,but withdraw, thyself, show unto the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what things Moses enjoined, for a witness unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But, he, going forth, began to be proclaiming many things, and blazing abroad the story, so that, no longer, was it possible for him, openly, into a city, to enter,but, outside, in desert places,  was he , and they were coming unto him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
