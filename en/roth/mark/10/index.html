None, is good, save oneGod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The commandments, thou knowest,Do not commit murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal; Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour thy father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, he, said unto himTeacher! all these things, have I kept, from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said unto himOne thing, unto thee, is wanting;Withdraw! whatsoever thou hast, sell, and give unto  the  destitute,and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come! be following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, he, becoming gloomy because of the word, departed sorrowing, for he was holding, many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, looking around, Jesus saith unto his disciplesWith what difficulty, shall, they who have money, enter, into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, the disciples, were in amazement, because of the words. But, Jesus, again answering, saith unto themChildren! how difficult, it is, to enter, into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is, easier, for a camel, through the eye of a needle, to pass, than for, a rich man, into the kingdom of God, to enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, they, were being exceedingly struck with astonishment, saying unto himWho, then, can, be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Looking at them, Jesus saithWith men, impossible, but not, with God; for, all things, are possible, with God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter began to be saying unto himLo! we, have left all, and followed thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus saidVerily, I say unto youThere is, no one, who hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me, and  for the sake of  the glad-message,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive a hundredfold, now, in this season, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands,with persecutions, and, in the age that is coming, life age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But, many, shall befirst-last, and  the  Last-first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now they were in the way, going up unto Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on before them,and they were in amazement; and, they who followed, were in fear. And, taking unto himself, again, the twelve, he began to be saying unto them, as to the things about to befall him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Lo! we are going up unto Jerusalem; and, the Son of Man, will be delivered up, unto the Chief-priests and the Scribes,and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him up unto the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and, slay;and, after three days, will he, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And there come near unto him, James and John, the  two  sons of Zebedee,saying unto himTeacher! we desire, that, whatsoever we shall ask thee, thou wilt do for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But, he, said unto themWhat desire ye, I should do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, they, said unto himGrant us, that, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, we may sit, in thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But, Jesus, said unto themYe know not what ye are asking: Are ye able to drink the cup that, I, am to drink? or to be immersed, with the immersion wherewith, I, am to be immersed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, they, said unto himWe are able. And, Jesus, said unto themThe cup which, I, am to drink, ye shall drink, and, with the immersion wherewith, I, am to be immersed, shall ye be immersed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But, to sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, except unto them for whom it hath been prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the ten, hearing, began to be sorely displeased, concerning James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus, calling them near, saith unto themYe know that, they who think to rule the nations, lord it over them, and, their great ones, wield authority over them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But, not so, it is, among you. But, whosoever desireth to become, great, among you, shall be, your minister,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, whosoever desireth, among you, to be, first, shall be, servant of all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For, even the Son of Man, came not to be ministered unto, but minister,and to give his life, a ransom instead of many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they come into Jericho. And, as he was journeying forth from Jericho, and his disciples, and a considerable multitude, the son of Timaeus, blind Bar-Timaeus, a beggar, was sitting beside the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, hearing that it was, Jesus the Nazarene, he began to be crying aloud, and sayingO Son of David! Jesus! have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many were rebuking him, that he might hold his peace; but, he, so much the more, was crying aloud, O Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And, coming to a stand, Jesus saidCall him! And they call the blind man, saying unto himTake courage! rise! he calleth thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And, he, throwing off his mantlespringing to his feet, came unto Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, answering him, Jesus saidWhat desirest thou, I should do for thee? And, the blind man, said unto himRabboni! that may recover sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And, Jesus, said unto himGo thy way! thy faith, hath saved thee. And, straightway, he recovered sight, and was following him in the road.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
