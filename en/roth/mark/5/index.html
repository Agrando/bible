O Jesus, Son of God Most High? I adjure thee by God,Do not torment me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he was saying to himGo forth thou impure spirit, out of the man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he was questioning himWhat is thy name? and he saith to himLegion, is my name, because we are, many;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and he was beseeching him much that he would not send them forth outside the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there was there, near the mountain, a large herd of swine, feeding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they besought him, sayingSend us into the swine, that, into them, we may enter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he suffered them. And the impure spirits, going out, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the cliff into the sea, about two thousand, and were choked in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, they who had been feeding them, fled, and bare tidings into the city and into the fields,and they came to see what it was that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come unto Jesus, and view the demonized man, clothed and of sound mind, him who had had the legion,and they were struck with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the beholders narrated to them, how it happened to the demonized man, and concerning the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they began to beseech him, to depart from their bounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, as he was entering into the boat, he who had been demonized was beseeching him, that, with him, he might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he suffered him not, but saith unto himWithdraw into thy house, unto thine own, and bear tidings unto them, how many things the Lord for thee hath done, and hath had mercy on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he departed, and began proclaiming, in the Decapolis, how many things Jesus had done for him,and, all, were marvelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, Jesus crossing over in the boat again unto the other side, there was gathered a large multitude unto him, and he was by the lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And there cometh one of the synagogue-rulers, by name Jairus, and, seeing him, falleth at his feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and beseecheth him much, sayingMy little daughter is at her last!that, coming, thou wouldest lay thy hands upon her, that she may be made well, and live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he departed with him. And there was following him a large multitude, and they were pressing upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, a woman, who had had a flow of blood twelve years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and suffered much from many physicians, and spent all her means, and profited, nothing,but had, rather, become worse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>hearing the things about Jesus, came in the crowd from behind, and touched his mantle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for she was sayingIf I can touch so much as his mantle, I shall be made well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and, straightway, the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew, in her body, that she was healed from the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, straightway, Jesus, taking note in himself of the power which, out of him, went forth, turning round in the crowd, was sayingWho hath touched my garments?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and his disciples were saying to himThou seest the crowd pressing upon thee,and sayest thouWho hath touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and he was looking round to see her who, this thing had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, the woman, overcome with fear, and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came, and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, he, said to herDaughter! thy faith hath made thee well; withdraw into peace, and be whole from thy plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While yet he is speaking, they come from the synagogue-rulers, sayingThy daughter, is dead! Why, further, annoy the teacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But, Jesus, overhearing the word being spoken, saith unto the synagogue-rulerDo not fear, only have faith!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he suffered no one to follow with him, save Peter and James and John the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they come into the house of the synagogue-ruler, and he observeth a tumult, and persons weeping and wailing greatly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and, entering, he saith unto themWhy are ye making a tumult, and weeping? The child, is, not dead, but, is sleeping;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and they were deriding him. But, he, thrusting all forth, taketh with him the father of the child, and the mother, and them who were with him,and entereth where the child was;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and, grasping the hand of the child, he saith unto herTalitha, koum! which is, when translatedO damsel! to thee, I say, Arise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, straightway, the damsel arose, and was walking about; for she was twelve years of age. And they were beside themselves, straightway, with a great transport;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he commanded them, again and again, that, no one, should get to know this thing,and bade that food should be given her to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
