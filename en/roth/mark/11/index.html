Blessed, is he that is coming in the name of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed, is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple, and, looking round on all things, late already being the hour, he went out into Bethany, with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, on the morrow, when they came forth from Bethany, he hungered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and, seeing a fig-tree from afar, having leaves, he came if, therefore, he should find aught in it, and, coming up to it, nothing, found he, save, leaves; for it was not, the season, of figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, answering, he said unto itNo more, unto times age-abiding, let anyone of thee, eat fruit. And his disciples were listening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come into Jerusalem. And, entering into the temple, he began to be casting out them who were selling and them who were buying in the temple, and, the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them who were selling doves, he overthrew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and was not suffering that anyone should carry a vessel through the temple;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and was teaching, and sayingIs it not written, My house, a house of prayer, shall be called, for all the nations? but, ye, have made it, A den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the High-priests and the Scribes, heard, it, and began seeking how they might, destroy, him,for they were fearing him; for, all the multitude, were being struck with astonishment at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, as soon as it became late, they were going forth outside the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, passing by early, they saw the fig-tree, withered from its roots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and, put in mind, Peter saith unto himRabbi! see! the fig-tree which thou didst curse, is withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, answering, Jesus saith unto themHave faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Verily, I say unto youWhosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be lifted up, and cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that, what he speaketh, cometh to pass, it shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this cause, I say unto youAll things, whatsoever ye are praying for and asking, believe that ye have received, and they shall be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, when ye stand praying, forgive, if aught ye have against any,that, your Father also, who is in the heavens, may forgive you your offences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>fehlt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they come again into Jerusalem. And, as he is walking in the temple, the High-priests and the Scribes and the Elders come unto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and were saying unto himBy what authority, these things, art thou doing? And who to thee hath given this authority that, these things, thou shouldst be doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But, Jesus, said unto themI will question you, as to one matter, and answer me,and I will tell you, by what authority, these things, I am doing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The immersion by John, Of heaven, was it, or, of men? Answer me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they were deliberating among themselves, sayingIf we say, Of heaven, he will say, Wherefore  then  did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But, should we say, Of men, they were in fear of the multitude, for, one and all, were holding John, in very deed, that he was, a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, making answer unto Jesus, they sayWe know not; and Jesus saith unto themNeither do, I, tell you, by what authority, these things, I am doing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
