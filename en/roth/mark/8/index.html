And, taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he brake, and was giving unto his disciples, that they might be setting before them; and they set before the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they had a few small fishes; and, blessing them, he bade them set, these also, before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they did eat, and were filled, and took up remainders of broken pieces, seven hampers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now they were about four thousand; and he dismissed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, straightway, entering into the boat with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and forth came the Pharisees, and began discussing with him, seeking of him, a sign from the heaven, testing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, deeply sighing in his spirit, he saithWhy, doth this generation seek, a sign? Verily, I saythere shall, not be given, to this generation, a sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And leaving them, again, embarking, he departed unto the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they forgot to take loaves, and, save one loaf, they had nothing with them in the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he began charging them, sayingMind! beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they began deliberating one with another, because they had no loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, taking note, he saith unto themWhy do ye deliberate, because ye have no, loaves? Not yet perceive ye, neither understand,keep ye your hearts, hardened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Eyes having, see ye not? and ears having, hear ye not? and remember ye not</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>when, the five loaves, I brake unto the five thousand, how many baskets, full of broken pieces, ye took up? They say unto himTwelve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the seven, unto the four thousand, how many hampers, full measure, of broken pieces, ye took up? And they say unto himSeven. And he was saying unto them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not yet, do ye understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they come into Bethsaida. And they bring unto him one blind, and beseech him that him, he would touch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, laying hold of the hand of the blind man, he brought him forth outside the village, and, spitting into his eyes, laying his hands upon him, he was asking himAnything, seest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and, looking up, he was sayingI see men, because, like trees, I behold them walking</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then again, put he his hands upon his eyes, and he saw clearly, and was restored, and was seeing distinctly, in broad splendour, all things together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he sent him away unto his house, sayingNot even into the village, mayest thou enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And forth went Jesus and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea of Philip. And, in the way, he was questioning his disciples, saying unto themWho, are men saying that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered him, sayingJohn the Immerser, and, others, Elijah,and, others, One of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, he, went on to question themBut, who, say, ye, that I am? Peter, answering, saith unto himThou, art, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he straitly charged them, that, no one, they should tell concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he began to be teaching themThe Son of Man, must needs suffer many things, and be rejected by the Elders and the High-priests and the Scribes,and be slain; and, after three days, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, openly, was he speaking the word. And Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But, he, turning round and looking upon his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saithWithdraw behind me, Satan! because thou art not regarding the things, of God, but the things, of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, calling near the multitude with his disciples, he said unto themIf anyone willeth, after me, to come, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and be following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For, whosoever willeth, his own life, to save, shall lose it, but, whosoever shall lose his life for the sake  of me and  of the glad-message, shall save it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For, what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and be made to forfeit his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For what can a man, give, in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For, whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also, will be ashamed, of him, whensoever he shall come, in the glory of his Father, with the holy messengers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
