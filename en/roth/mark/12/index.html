And many others; some, indeed beating, and, others, slaying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet one, had he, a son beloved: he sent him forth last unto them, sayingThey will pay deference unto my son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, those husbandmen, unto themselves, saidThis, is the heir: Come! let us slay him, and, ours, shall be, the inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, taking, they slew him, and cast him forth outside the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come, and destroy the husbandmen, and let the vineyard unto others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have ye not, this scripture, readA stone which the builders rejected, the same, hath become head of the corner!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>From the Lord, hath this come to pass, and is marvellous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were seeking, to secure, him,and were in fear of the multitude; for they perceived that, against them, the parable he had spoken. And, leaving him, they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they send forth unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might, catch, him, in discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, coming, they say unto himTeacher! we know that, true, thou art, and it concerneth thee not about anyone,for thou lookest not unto the face of men; but, in truth, the way of God, dost teach:Is it allowable to give tax unto Caesar, or not? Should we give, or should we not give?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto themWhy are ye, tempting, me? Bring me a denary, that I may see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, they, brought one. And he saith unto themWhose, is this image, and the inscription? And, they, said unto himCaesars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, Jesus, saidthe things of Caesar, render, unto Caesar, and, the things of God, unto God. And they were marvelling at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there come Sadducees unto him,who, indeed sayResurrection, there is none! and they were questioning him, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Teacher! Moses, wrote for us, thatIf ones brother die, and leave behind a wife, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Seven brethren, there were: and, the first, took a wife, and, dying, left no seed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, the second, took her, and died, not leaving behind seed,and, the third, likewise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, the seven, left no seed; last of all, the woman also, died:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection,of, which, of them shall she be, wife? For, the seven, had her to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus said unto themAre ye not, for this cause, deceiving yourselves, knowing neither the Scriptures, nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For, when, from among the dead, they rise, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like messengers in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, as touching the dead, that they, do rise,Have ye not read in the book of Moses, at the Bush, how God spake unto him, sayingI   the God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not a God of, dead, men, but of, living. Greatly, are ye deceiving yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the Scribes, coming near, hearing them discussing, seeing that, well, he had answered them, began to question himWhich is the chief commandment of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answeredThe chief is: Hear! O Israel,The Lord our God, is, one Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore shalt thou love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,and with all thy mind; and with all thy strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The second, is, thisThou shalt love, thy neighbour, as thyself. Greater than these, other commandment, is there none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Scribe said unto himWell, Teacher! in truth, hast thou saidHe is, One, and there is none other, than he;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, to love him, with all the heart, and with all the understanding,and with all the might; and to love ones neighbour as ones self, is, abundantly more, than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, Jesus, seeing him, that, with intelligence he answered, said unto himNot far,  art thou  from the kingdom of God! And, no one, any longer, was daring to, question, him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus, answering, was saying, as he taught in the templeHow say the Scribes that, the Christ, is, Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>David himself, hath said, by the Holy Spirit,The Lord, hath said unto, my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I put thy foes beneath thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David himself, calleth him, Lord: whence, then, is he, his own soul? And, the great multitude, was hearing him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, in his teaching, he was sayingBeware of the Scribes, who desire, in robes, to be walking about, and salutations in the markets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in the chief meals,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Who devour widows houses, and, for a pretence, are long in prayer: these, shall receive a more surpassing judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, taking his seat over against the treasury, he was observing how, the multitude, was casting in copper into the treasury, and, man rich, were casting in, much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And there came, one destitute, widow, and cast in two mites, which are, a farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And, calling near his disciples, he said to themVerily, I say unto you, this destitute widow, more than they all, hath cast in, of those casting into the treasury;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For, they all, out of their surplus, cast in, but, she, out of her deficiency, all, as much as she had, cast in,the whole of her living.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
