And, he, answering him, saithThou, sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the High-priests began to accuse him, of many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, Pilate, again, was questioning him,  saying Answerest thou, nothing? See! of how many things, they are accusing thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But, Jesus, no further, answered, anything, so that Pilate began to marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, at feast time, he was wont to release unto them one prisoner, whom they were claiming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was the so-called Barabbas, with the rebels, bound, even with them who, in the rebellion, had committed, murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, going up, the multitude began to be claimingaccording as he was wont to do for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But, Pilate, answered them, sayingWill ye, I release unto you, the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he was getting to know that, for envy, had  the High-priests  delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, the High-priests, stirred up the multitude, that, rather Barabbas, he should release unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, Pilate, again answering, was saying unto themWhat then shall I do with him whom ye call, the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, they, again, cried outCrucify him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, Pilate, was saying unto themWhy! what, evil, hath he done? And, they, vehemently, cried outCrucify him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pilate, being minded to do what would satisfy, the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, having scourged him, that he should be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, the soldiers, led him away, inside the court, which is a judgment-hall,and called together the whole band;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they array him in purple, and set upon him, when they have plaited it; a crown of thorns,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and began to be saluting himJoy to thee! King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and were striking him on the head with a reed, and were spitting at him,and, bowing their knees, were doing him homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, when they had mocked him, they put off him, the purple, and put on him, his own garments. And they lead him forth, that they may crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they impress a certain passer-by, Simon a Cyrenian, coming from a field, the father of Alexander and Rufus,that he may carry his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they bring him unto the Golgotha place, which is, being translated, Skull-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they would have given him, myrrhed wine,who, however, received it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they crucify him, and part asunder his garments, casting a lot upon themwho should have anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the inscription of his accusation, had been inscribedTHE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, with him, they crucify, two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, the passers-by, were reviling him, shaking their heads, and sayingAha! thou who wast pulling down the shrine, and building one in three days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Save thyself,coming down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Likewise, the High-priests also, mocking one to another, with the Scribes, were sayingOthers, he saved, himself, he cannot save!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Christ, the King of Israellet him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.

Elijah, he calleth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one, running, filled a sponge with vinegar, and, putting it about a reed, was giving him to drink, sayingStay! let us see whether Elijah is coming, to take him down!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But, Jesus, sending out a loud voice, ceased to breathe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, the veil of the Temple, was rent into two, from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now the centurion, who was standing near, out over against him, seeing, that, thus, he ceased to breathe, saidTruly, this man, was Gods son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And there were, women also, from afar, looking on,among whom were both Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Little and Joses, and Salome;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who, when he was in Galilee, used to follow him, and minister unto him,and many other women, who had come up with him unto Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And evening, already, having begun, since it was a preparation, that is, the eve of a Sabbath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Joseph of Arimathaea, a noble counsellor, who, also himself, was awaiting the kingdom of God, came; and, venturing, went in unto Pilate, and claimed the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But, Pilate, wondered whether, already, he was dead; and, calling near the centurion, questioned himwhether he had, already, died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, getting to know from the centurion, he presented the corpse unto Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, buying a fine Indian cloth, he took him down, and wrapped him about with the cloth, and laid him in a tomb, which had been hewn out of a rock,and rolled near a stone upon the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, were viewing how he had been laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
