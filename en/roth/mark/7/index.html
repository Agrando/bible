And, many such similar things, are ye doing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, again calling near the multitude, he was saying unto themHearken to me, all! and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nothing, is there, from without the man, entering into him, which can defile him; but, the things which, out of the man, come forth, are the things that defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, when he entered into a house from the multitudes, his disciples began to question him as to the parable;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he saith unto themThus, are, ye also, without discernment? Perceive ye not that, nothing, from without, entering into the man, can defile him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because it entereth not into his heart, but into his stomach, and, into the draught, is passedpurifying all foods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he was sayingThat which, out of the man, cometh forth, that, defileth the man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, from within, out of the heart of men, the base designs, come forth,fornications, thefts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>murders, adulteries, covetousnesses, knaveries, deceit, wantonness, an evil eye, profane speaking, foolishness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>all these wicked things, from within, come forth, and defile, the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, from thence arising, he departed into the bounds of Tyre  and Zidon . And, entering into a house, he was wishing, no one, to know it, and yet could not escape notice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but, straightway, a woman hearing about him, whose daughter had an impure spirit, she came and fell down at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, the woman, was a Grecian, a Syrophoenician by race,and she was requesting him that, the demon, he would cast forth out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he was saying to herSuffer, the children, first, to be fed; for it is not seemly to take the bread of the children, and, unto the little dogs, to cast it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but she answered and saith to himYea, Lord! and yet, the little dogs under the table, do eat of the crumbs of the children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he said to herBecause of this word, go thy way, the demon hath gone forth out of thy daughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and, departing unto her house, she found the child laid prostrate on the couch, and the demon gone forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, again coming forth out of the bounds of Tyre, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the bounds of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they bring to him one deaf and stammering, and beseech him that he would lay upon him his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, taking him away from the multitude apart, he thrust his fingers into his ears, and, spitting, touched his tongue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and, looking up into the heaven, sighed deeply, and saith unto himEphphatha! that is, Be opened!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and his ears opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed,and he was speaking correctly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he charged them that they should be telling, no one,but, as much as to them he gave charge, they, exceeding more abundantly, were making proclamation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, superabundantly, were they being struck with astonishment, sayingWell, hath he, all things, done,both, the deaf, he causeth to hear, and, the dumb, to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
