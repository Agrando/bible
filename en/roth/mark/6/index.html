For they who were coming and they who were going were many, and, not even to eat, were they finding fitting opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they departed, in the boat, into a desert place, apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And many saw them going away, and took note of it, and, afoot, from all the cities, ran they together thither,and outwent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, coming forth, he saw, a great multitude, and was moved with compassion towards them, because they were like sheep having no shepherd, and he began to be teaching them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, already, a late hour, having arrived, his disciples came unto him and were saying, A desert, is the place, and it is, already, a late hour:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>dismiss them, that, departing into the surrounding hamlets and villages, they may buy themselves something to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, he, answering said to themYe, give them, to eat. And they say unto himShall we depart and buy two hundred denaries worth of loaves, and give them to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, he, saith unto themHow many loaves, have ye?

But, he, straightway, talked with them, and saith unto themTake courage! it is, Ibe not afraid!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went up unto them, into the boat,and the wind lulled. And, exceedingly, within themselves, were they astonished;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for they understood not by the loaves,but their, heart, had been, hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And crossing over unto the land, they came unto Gennesaret, and cast anchor near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And, when they had, come forth, out of the boat, straightway, recognizing him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>the people ran round the whole of that country, and began to be carrying round, upon couches, them who were sick, wherever they heard that he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And, wheresoever he was entering into villages, or into cities, or into hamlets, in the marketplaces, laid they the sick, and were beseeching him, that, only the fringe of his mantle, they might touch, and, as many soever as touched it, were being made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
