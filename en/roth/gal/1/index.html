Or am I seeking to please, men? If I had been still pleasing, men, Christs servant, had I not been!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I make known unto you, brethren, as to the glad-message which was announced by me, that it is not after man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither, from man, did I accept it, nor was taught   ,but through a revealing of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For ye have heard, as to my own manner of life, at one time, in Judaism, how that, exceedingly, was I persecuting the assembly of God, and laying it waste,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And was making advancement, in Judaism, above many contemporaries in my nation, being, surpassingly zealous, of my paternal instructions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, when God, who set me apart from my mothers womb and called me through his favour, was well-pleased</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son in me, that I might announce the glad-message regarding him among the nations, straightway, I conferred not with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither went I up unto Jerusalem unto them who, before me, were apostles,but I went away into Arabia, and again returned unto Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then, after three years, went I up unto Jerusalem, to become acquainted with Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, other of the apostles, saw I none, save James the brother of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, as touching the things which I am writing to you, lo! before God, I am not guilty of falsehood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After that, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And was still unknown, by face, unto the assemblies of Judaea which were in Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only they were hearingHe that was persecuting us formerly, now, is announcing the glad-message of the faith which he formerly laid waste;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they were glorifying, God, in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
