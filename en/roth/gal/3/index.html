Having made a beginning in Spirit, are ye, now, in flesh, to be made complete?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Such things, suffered ye, in vain,if at least   even in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He then who was supplying unto you the Spirit, and energising mighty works among you, by works of law, or by a believed report</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even as Abrahambelieved in God, and it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be taking note, thereforethat, they who are of faith, the same, are, sons, of Abraham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, the scripture, foreseeing, that, by faith, God would declare the nations righteous, fore-announced the good news unto Abraham, saying, All the nations shall be blessed in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then, they who are of faith, are blessed with believing Abraham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, as many as are of works of law, are, under a curse,for it is writtenAccursed, is everyone that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, that, in law, no one, is declared righteous with God,   evident,because, The righteous one, by faith, shall live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, the law, is not of faith, buthe that hath done them, shall live in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ, hath redeemed, us, out of the curse of the law, having become, in our behalf, a curse;because it is writtenCursed, is every one that hangeth upon a tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In order that, unto the nations, the blessing of Abraham, might come about in Jesus Christ,in order that, the promise of the Spirit, we might receive through means of the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brethren! in human fashion, am I speaking: yet still, a mans confirmed covenant, no one setteth aside or addeth unto:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, unto Abraham, were spoken the promisesand unto his seed;He saith notand unto thy seeds, as of many, but, as of oneand unto thy seed, which is Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, this, I saya covenant previously confirmed by God, the law which, after four hundred and thirty years, hath been brought into being, doth not annul, so as to do away with the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, if, by law, is the inheritance, it is, no longer, by promise; but, unto Abraham, through promise, hath God favoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why, then, the law? Because of the transgressions, it was added, until such time as the seed should come, unto whom the promise had been made, and was given in charge through messengers, at the hand of a mediator;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, a mediator, is not   of one, but, God, is, one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is, the law, then, against the promises  of God ? Far be it! For, if a law had been given, which had been able to give life, verily, in law, would have been our righteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Scripture, did shut up, all things, under sin, that, the promise by faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to them who have faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Before the coming of the faith, however, under law, were we being kept in ward, being shut up unto the faith which should afterwards, be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that, the law, hath proved, our tutor, training us, for Christ, in order that, by faith, we might be declared righteous;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, the faith having come, no longer, are we, under a tutor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For ye, all, are, sons of God, through the faith in Christ Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For ye, as many as, into Christ, have been immersed, have put Christ, on:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There cannot be Jew or Greek, there cannot be bond or free, there cannot be male and female, for, all ye, are one, in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, if, ye, are of Christ, by consequence ye are, Abrahams seed, according to promise, heirs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
