God, is not to be mocked; for, whatsoever a man soweth, the same, shall he also reap,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because, he that soweth into his own flesh, out of the flesh, shall reap corruption, whereas, he that soweth into the Spirit, out of the Spirit, shall reap age-abiding life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, in doing that which is honourable, let us not be fainthearted; for, in due season, we shall reap, if we faint not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hence, then, as we have opportunity, let us be working what is good, towards all,but, especially, towards the family of the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>See! with what large letters, unto you, I have written, with my own hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As many as are wishing to make a good show in flesh, the same, are compelling you to get circumcised,only that, for the cross of Christ  Jesus , they may not be suffering persecution!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, not even they who are getting circumcised, are, themselves, observing law,but are wishing you to be circumcised, that, in your flesh, they may boast themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With me, however, far be it! to be boasting, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,whereby, unto me, a world hath been crucified, and, I, unto a world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For neither circumcision is anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, as many as, by this rule, shall walk, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the rest, annoyances, unto me, let no one be offering; for, I, the brandmarks of Jesus, in my body, am bearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The favour of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with your spirit, brethren.
