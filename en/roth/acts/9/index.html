Saul! why, me, art thou persecuting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he saidWho art thou, Lord? And, he,   I, am Jesus, whom, thou, art persecuting!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But rise up, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, the men who were accompanying him, stood speechless,hearing, indeed, the voice, but beholding no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul arose from the earth, and, his eyes being opened, he could see nothing; and, taking him by the hand, they led him into Damascus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he was three days without seeing, and did neither eat nor drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus, by name Ananias; and, the Lord, said unto him in a visionAnanias! And, he, saidLo! I,   , Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord   unto himRise! go into the street which is called Straight, and seek, in the house of Judas, one Saul, by name, of Tarsus. For lo! he is praying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And hath seen a man  in a vision , Ananias by name, coming in and laying on him his hands, to the intent he should see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Ananias, answeredLord! I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things unto thy saints he hath done in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, here, he hath authority from the High-priests to bind all them that call upon thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord said unto himBe going thy way; for, a choice vessel unto me, is this man, to bear my name before both  the  nations and kings, and the sons of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, I, will let him understand how many things he must needs, for my name, suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and, laying upon him his hands, saidSaul, brother! The Lord, hath sent me,Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way by which thou wast coming,that thou mayest recover sight, and be filled with Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, straightway, there fell from himfrom his eyes,as it were scales; he recovered sight also, and, arising, was immersed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, receiving food, gained strength. And he came to be with the disciples who were in Damascus certain days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, straightway, in the synagogues, he began proclaiming Jesus, that, This, is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all who were hearing were astonished, and began to sayis not, this, he who destroyed, in Jerusalem, them that invoke this name; and, here, for this purpose, had come, in order that he might lead them, bound, unto the High-priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But, Saul, was the more gaining power; and was confounding the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, shewing, by comparison, thatThis, is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, when a considerable number of days were being fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But their plot was made known unto Saul,and they were even narrowly watching the gates, both day and night, that they might kill him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the disciples, taking him by night, through the wall, let him down, lowering him in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, when he had arrived in Jerusalem, he made attempts to join himself unto the disciples; and all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, Barnabas, taking him, brought him unto the apostles, and related unto them,how, in the way, he had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken unto him; and how, in Damascus, he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And was both speaking and discussing with the Grecian Jews,but, they, were setting to work to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the brethren, discovering it, brought him down into Caesarea, and sent him away unto Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, the assembly throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, had peace, building itself up, and going on its way in the fear of the Lord; and, by the advocacy of the Holy Spirit, was being multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass that, Peter, going through all   went down unto the saints also dwelling in Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he found there a certain man, by name Aeneas, who, for eight years, had been lying prostrate upon a bed, for he was paralysed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said unto himAeneas! Jesus Christ healeth thee! Arise, and smooth thy bed for thyself. And, straightway, he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all who dwelt in Lydda and Saron, saw him,and, they, turned unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now, in Joppa, there was a certain female disciple, by name Tabitha, which, being translated, means Dorcas   . The same, was full of good works and alms which she was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass in those days, that she, sickening, died; and, bathing her, they laid her in an upper room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now, Lydda being nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was therein, sent off two men unto him, beseeching himDo not delay to come through unto us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Peter, arising, went with them,whom, when he arrived, they brought up into the upper room; and there stood by him all the widows, weeping, and showing the tunics and mantleswhatsoever things Dorcas was making while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Peter, putting them all outside, knelt down and prayed; and, turning towards the body, saidTabitha, arise! And she, opening her eyes and seeing Peter, sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, giving her his hand, he raised her up; and, calling the saints and the widows, presented her, living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it became known throughout the whole of Joppa, and many believed upon the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And it came to pass that, for a considerable number of days, he abode in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
