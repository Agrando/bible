Unto the Jews, have I done no wrong, as, even thou, right well, art discovering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then, on the one hand, I am doing wrong, and, anything worthy of death, have committed, I excuse not myself from dying; but, on the other hand, if there is, nothing, in the things whereof these are accusing me, no man, hath power to give, me, unto them as a favour:Unto Caesar, I appeal!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, having conversed with the council, answeredUnto Caesar, hast thou appealed? Unto Caesar, shalt thou go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, some days having gone by, Agrippa the king and Bernice came down to Caesarea, to salute Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, as they were spending more days there, Festus, repeated, unto the king, the things relating to Paul, sayingA certain man, hath been left behind by Felix, as a prisoner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>concerning whom, when I happened to be in Jerusalem, the High-priests and the Elders of the Jews laid information, claiming against him a condemnation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>unto whom made answerThat it is not a custom with Romans, to grant as a favour any man, before the accused, face to face, should have his accusers, and, opportunity of defence, should receive, concerning the charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When, therefore, they had come together here, no delay whatever, making, on the next day, taking my place upon the judgment-seat, I ordered the man to be brought:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Concerning whom, taking their stand, his accusers, no accusation at all, were bringing, of the evil things which, I, had been suspecting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but, certain questions concerning their own demon-worship, had they against him, and concerning one Jesus, who had died, whom Paul was affirming to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, I, being at a loss as to the inquiry into these things, was askingwhether he might be minded to go unto Jerusalem, and, there, be judged concerning these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, Paul, having appealed to be kept for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept, until I could send him up unto Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, Agrippa,   unto FestusI could wish, myself also, to hear, the man. To-morrow, (saith he) thou shalt hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On the morrow, therefore, when Agrippa had come, and Bernice, with great display, and they had entered into the audience-chamber, with the captains of thousands and men of distinction of the city,and Festus had given orders, Paul was brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus saithKing Agrippa! and all ye men, here present with us: Ye observe this person, concerning whom, one and all the throng of the Jews, have interceded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying aloud that he ought not to be living any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, I, gathered, that, nothing worthy of death, had he committed; and, this man himself, having appealed unto the Emperor, I decided to send him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Concerning whom, anything certain to write unto my lord, I have not; wherefore, I have brought him forth before you,and especially before thee, King Agrippa! in order that, after examination had, I might have something I could write;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, unreasonable, unto me, it seemeth, when sending a prisoner, not also, the accusations against him, to signify.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
