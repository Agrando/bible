And they said unto himNay! not even whether there is Holy Spirit, did we hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he saidInto what, then, were ye immersed? And, they, saidUnto Johns immersion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said PaulJohn, immersed with an immersion of repentance, unto the people, saying, that, on him who was coming after him, they should believe,that is, on Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, when they heard   , they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and, Paul laying hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all the men were about twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, entering into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But, when some were hardening themselves, and refusing to be persuaded, speaking evil of the Way before the throng, withdrawing from them, he separated the disciples; day by day, reasoning in the school of Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, this, took place for two years, so that, all who dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Mighty works, also, not the ordinary, God was working through the hands of Paul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that, even unto the sick, were being carried from his body, handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases were departing from them, and, the wicked spirits, were going out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But certain also of the wandering Jews, exorcists, took in hand to be naming, over them that had the wicked spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, sayingI adjure you, by Jesus whom Paul proclaimeth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a High-priest, who, this thing, were doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the wicked spirit. Answering, said unto themJesus,  indeed , I am getting to know, and, Paul, I well-know,but who are, ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man in whom was the wicked spirit, springing upon them, mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that, naked and wounded, fled they out of that house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, this, became known to allboth Jews and Greekswho were dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Many also of them who had believed, were coming, making open confession, and renouncing their practices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, a good many of them who had practised the curious arts, bringing together the books, were burning them before all; and they reckoned up the prices of them, and found them fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus, with might, the Lords word, was growing and prevailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his spirit, going through Macedonia and Achaia, to be journeying unto Jerusalem, sayingAfter I have been there, Rome also, must I see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, sending off into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself, held on awhile in Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there arose during that season no small disturbance concerning the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, one Demetrius by name, a silversmith, making  silver  shrines, of Diana, used to bring unto the craftsmen no little business;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>gathering whom together, and them who in such things wrought, he saidMen! ye well know that, by this business, we have our prosperity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and ye perceive and hear that, not only in Ephesus, but well-nigh in all Asia, this Paul, hath persuaded and turned away a considerable multitude, saying that they are, no gods, which, with hands, are made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, not only is there danger that this our heritage into ill-repute may come, but even that the temple, of the great Goddess Diana, for nothing, may be counted; also that, even on the point of being pulled down, may be Her Majesty, whom, all Asia and the habitable world, do worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now, hearing this, and becoming full of wrath, they began crying aloud, sayingGreat, is Diana of the Ephesians!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the city was filled with the confusion; they rushed also with one accord into the theatre, carrying off with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, fellow-travellers of Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, Paul, being minded to enter in among the populace, the disciples would not suffer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Moreover, certain of the Asiarchs also, being his friends, sending unto him, were beseeching him not to adventure himself into the theatre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Others, indeed, were crying out something else; for the assembly had become confused, and, the greater part, knew not for what cause they had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Howbeit, out of the multitude, they bare aloft one Alexander, the Jews thrusting him forward; Alexander, however, waving his hand, was wishing to make his defense unto the populace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But, recognizing that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all for about two hours, as they cried aloudGreat, is Diana of the Ephesians!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Howbeit the town-clerk, having calmed the multitude, saithEphesians! why, who is there of mankind that doth not acknowledge the city of Ephesians to be temple-keeper of the Great Diana, and of the  image  that fell from Jupiter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As these things, then, cannot be denied, it is needful that ye be calmed at once, and, nothing rash, be doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For ye have brought these men, neither as temple-robbers, nor as defaming our goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If then, Demetrius, and the craftsmen with him, have against anyone an accusation, courts, are being held, and there are, proconsuls: let them accuse one another!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But, if after, something further, ye are seeking, in the regular assembly shall it be settled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we are, even in danger of being accused of riot, concerning this day, no cause at all, existing, by reference to which we shall be able to give a reason for this concourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, these things, having said, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
