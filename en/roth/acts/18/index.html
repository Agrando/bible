Pure, am, I: henceforth, unto the nations, will I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, removing from thence, he came into the house of a certain man by name Titius Justus, who worshipped God, whose house was adjoining unto the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house. And, many of the Corinthians, hearing, were believing, and being immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said by night, through means of a vision, unto PaulBe not afraid! but be speaking,and do not hold thy peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Inasmuch as, I, am with thee, and, no one, shall set upon thee to harm thee; inasmuch as I have much people in this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he remained a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, with one accord, set upon Paul, and led him unto the judgment-seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>sayingContrary to the law, is this one seducing men to be worshipping God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the JewsIf, indeed, it had been some wrong or wicked recklessness, O Jews, with reason, in that case, should I have been bearing with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If, however, they are questions concerning discourse, and names, and law, that which ye have, ye shall see to it, yourselves; A judge of these things, I, am not disposed to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But they all, laying hold of Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, began to strike him before the judgment-seat; and, for none of these things, did Gallio care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Paul, however, still further abiding a good many days with the brethren, bidding them adieu, set sail for Syria; and, with him, Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they came down to Ephesus; and, as for them, he left them there,but, himself entering into the synagogue, he reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, when they requested him for a longer time to abide, he consented not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but, bidding them adieu, and sayingAgain, will I return unto you, God willing, he sailed away from Ephesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and, putting in at Caesarea, going up and saluting the assembly, went down unto Antioch;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and, spending some time, he went forth, passing through, in order, the country of Galatia and Phrygia, confirming all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, a learned man, came down to Ephesus, being, mighty, in the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The same, had been orally taught the way of the Lord, and, being fervent in his spirit, began speaking and teaching accurately, the things concerning Jesus,properly knowing, only the immersion of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The same, also began speaking boldly in the synagogue; and Priscilla and Aquila, hearing him, took him unto them, and, more accurately, expounded unto him the way of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, he being minded to pass through into Achaia, the brethren urgently wrote unto the disciples to welcome him,who, arriving, was very useful unto them who had believed, with his gift;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for, with great force, began he confuting the Jews, publicly, shewing by the Scriptures that Jesus was, the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
