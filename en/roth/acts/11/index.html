And there went with me these six brethren also; and we entered into the house of the man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he related to us how he had seen the messenger in his house, standing, and sayingSend away unto Joppa, and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who shall speak words unto thee, whereby thou shall be saved, thou, and all thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, as I began to be speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as upon us also at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I was put in mind of the word of the Lord, how he used to sayJohn, indeed, immersed with water; but, ye, shall be immersed in Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If therefore the like free-gift God gave unto them, as even unto us, when we had believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, who was, I, that could withstand God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, having heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, sayingHence, even unto the nations, God hath granted repentance unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They, therefore, who had been scattered abroad by reason of the tribulation that took place on account of Stephen, passed through as far as Phoenice and Cyprus and Antioch, unto no one speaking the word, save alone unto Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there were some from among them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who, indeed, coming unto Antioch, began speaking, even unto the Grecian Jews, announcing the glad tidings as to the Lord Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great numberthey who believedturned unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the matter was reported in the hearing of the assembly that was in Jerusalem, concerning them; and they sent forth Barnabas, as far as Antioch;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, arriving, and seeing the favour which was of God, rejoiced, and went on to beseech all, with the purpose of their heart, to abide  in  the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because he was a good man, and full of Holy Spirit and faith; and a considerable multitude were added unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He went away, however, unto Tarsus, to seek up Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, finding him, he brought him unto Antioch. And so it was with them, that, for a whole year, they were brought together in the assembly, and taught a considerable multitude; also that the disciples, first in Antioch, were called, Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now, in these days, there came down from Jerusalem, prophets, unto Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one from among them, by name Agabus, rising up, gave a sign, through means of the Spirit, that, a great famine, was coming over all the inhabited earth; which, indeed, came to pass under Claudius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, according as any one of the disciples was being prospered, they each one of them set apart   for ministering, to send unto the brethren, who dwelt in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Which thing they also did, sending it unto the Elders, through the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
