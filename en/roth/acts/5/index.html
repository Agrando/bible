Why was it that thou didst contrive in thy heart this deed? Thou hast not dealt falsely with men but, with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, as Ananias heard these words, he fell, and expired. And there came great fear upon all that heard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the young men, rising up, wrapped him about, and, bearing him forth, buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass, after about three hours interval, that his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Peter began to say unto herTell me! was it, for so much, ye gave up the field? And she saidYea! for so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, Peter,   unto herWhy was it agreed by you to put to the proof the Spirit of the Lord? Lo! the feet of them that have buried thy husband, are at the door, and they shall bear thee forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she fell instantly at his feet, and expired. And the young men, coming in, found her dead; and, bearing her forth, they buried her with her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there came great fear upon the whole assembly, and upon all them that heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, through the hands of the Apostles, were coming to pass many signs and wonders among the people; and they were all with one accord in the portico of Solomon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Howbeit, of the rest, no one, durst join himself unto them,nevertheless the people continued to magnify them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, the more, were being added, when they believed in the Lord, throngs both of men and women;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So that, even into the broad-ways, were they bringing forth the sick, and laying them on small couches and beds, in order that, if Peter were coming along, even perchance his shadow, might overshadow some one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover even the throng of the cities all round Jerusalem was coming together, bearing sick folk, and such as were harassed by impure spirits,who, indeed, were being cured, one and all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the High-priest, arising, and all who were with him,being the sect of the Sadducees,were filled with jealousy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And thrust their hands upon the Apostles, and put them in a public ward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, a messenger of the Lord, by night, opened the doors of the prison; and, leading them out, said</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Be going your way, and, taking your stand, be speaking, in the temple, unto the people, all the declarations of this Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, when they heard this, they entered, under the dawn, into the temple, and began teaching. And the High-priest and they who were with him, arriving, called together the high-council, and all the senate of the sons of Israel; and sent off unto the prison, to have them brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, the officers who came to the place, found them not in the prison; and, returning, brought tidings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>SayingThe prison, found we locked with all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors; but, when we had opened the prison, inside, found we, no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, when both the captain of the temple and the High-priests heard these words, they were utterly at a loss concerning themwhat perhaps this might come to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But some one, entering, brought tidings unto themLo! the men whom ye put in the prison, are in the temple, standing, and teaching the people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then, the captain with the officers, departing, brought themnot with violence,for they were afraid of the people, lest they should be stoned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, leading them in, set them in the high- council. And the High-priest questioned them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>SayingStrictly, did we charge you not to be teaching upon this name; and lo! ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and are minded to bring down upon us, the blood of this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter and the Apostles, answering, saidIt is needful to be yielding obedience unto God rather than unto men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers, hath raised up Jesus,whom, ye, got into your hands, suspending him upon a tree:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Him, as Princely-leader and Saviour, hath God exalted unto his right hand,to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, we, are witnesses of these things,also the Holy Spirit, which God hath given unto them who are yielding obedience unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and were making up their minds to slay them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But a certain man, rising up in the high-council, by name Gamaliel, a law-teacher honoured by all the people, gave orders to put the men, outside, for a little,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And said unto themMen of Israel! be taking heed unto yourselves, what ye are about to inflict upon these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For, before these days, there rose up one Theudas, affirming, himself, to be somebody,unto whom was inclined a number of men, about four hundred; who was slain, and, all as many as had been trusting in him, were disbanded, and came to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After him, rose up Judas the Galilaean, in the days of the enrolling, and drew a people into revolt after him; and, he, perished, and, all, as many as had trusted in him, were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now, therefore, I say unto youstand aloof from these men, and let them alone; because if, of men, be this project or this work, it will be overthrown,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But, if it is, of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them: lest once, even fighters against God, ye be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they were persuaded by him; and, calling unto them the Apostles, they, with beating, charged them not be speaking upon the name of Jesus; and let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They, therefore, went rejoicing from the presence of the high-council; in that they had been accounted worthy, in behalf of The Name, to suffer dishonour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, every day in the temple, and at home, they ceased not to be teaching, and telling the good news as to the Anointed Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
