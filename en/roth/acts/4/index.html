For, indeed, that a notable sign hath come to pass through their means, unto all who are dwelling in Jerusalem, is manifest, and we cannot deny   !</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless, lest it further spread abroad among the people, let us charge them with threats, to be no more speaking upon this name, to any soul of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, calling them, they gave them the sweeping charge,not to be sounding aloud, nor even to be teaching, upon the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, Peter and John, answering, said unto themWhether it be right in presence of God, unto you, to be hearkening, rather than unto God, judge!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, we, cannot but be speaking the things which we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They, however, further charging them with threats, let them go, finding nothing as to how they might chastise them, on account of the people; because, all, were glorifying God for that which had come to pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For, more than forty years old, was the man, upon whom had taken place, this healing sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, when they had been let go, they came unto their own   , and told as many things as, unto them, the High-priests and Elders, had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, they, having heard, with one accord, uplifted voice unto God, and saidO Sovereign! Thou, art he that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things that are herein:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who, by our father, through means of the Holy Spirit, even by the mouth of David thy servant, saidUnto what end did nations rage, and, peoples, busy themselves with empty things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth stationed themselves, and, the rulers, were gathered together, with one intent, against the Lord, and against his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they were gathered together, of a truth, in this city, against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed,both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with them of the nations, and peoples of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>To do whatsoever, thy hand and thy counsel, marked out beforehand to come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As to the present things, then, O Lord,look upon their threats, and grant unto thy servants, with all freedom of utterance, to be speaking thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By stretching forth thy hand for healing, and by the coming to pass of both signs and wonders, through the name of thy holy servant Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, when they had made supplication, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together, and they were filled, one and all, with the Holy Spirit, and began speaking the word of God with freedom of utterance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, the throng of them that believed, had one heart and soul, and not so much as one was saying that, aught of his goods, was, his own, but they had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, with great power, were the apostles giving forth their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; great favour also was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For there was not so much as anyone, lacking, among them; for, as many as were possessors of lands or houses, selling them, were bringing the prices of the things that were being sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And laying them at the feet of the Apostles, while on the other hand they were distributing unto each one, in so far as any one had, need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the Apostles, which is to be translated Son of Exhortation,a Levite, a Cyprian by nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the Apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
