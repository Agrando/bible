I, bound in my spirit, am journeying unto Jerusalem; the things which therein shall befall me, not knowing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>save that, the Holy Spirit, from city to city, doth bear me full witness, saying that, bonds and tribulations, await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, for no cause whatever, am I making my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus, to bear full witness as to the good news of the favour of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, now, lo! I, know that, no more, shall ye see my face,ye all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wherefore I take you to witness, on this very day, that, pure am I from the blood of all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for I have not shrunk from announcing all the counsel of God unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be taking heed unto yourselves, and unto all the little flock in which the Holy Spirit hath set, you, as overseers,to be shepherding the assembly of God which he hath acquired through means of the blood of his own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I, know, that there will enter, after my departure, grievous wolves into your midst, not sparing the little flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and, from among your own selves, will arise men speaking distorted things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Wherefore, be on the watch, remembering that, for three years, night and day, I gave myself no rest, with tears, admonishing each one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, therefore, I commend you unto the Lord, and unto his word of favour,which is able to build up and give the inheritance among all the hallowed ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The silver or gold or apparel of no one, did I covet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>yourselves, acknowledge that, for my necessities and for those who were with me, hard wrought these hands!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In all things, I gave you to understand, that, thus toiling, it behoves to be helping the weak, also to be keeping in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, that, he himself, saidHappy is it, rather to give than to receive!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, these things saying, kneeling down with them all, he prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all wept much, and, falling upon Pauls neck, they were tenderly kissing him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>being most distressed for the word which he had said,That, no more, should they, his face, behold. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
