And, othersOf foreign demons, he seemeth to be a declarer: because, of Jesus and the Resurrection, he was announcing the joyful tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And so, laying hold of him, they brought him up, to the Hill of Mars, sayingCan we get to know what this new teaching is, which, by thee, is being spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, certain foreign things, art thou bringing into our hearing: We are minded to get to know, therefore, what these things please to be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, all Athenians and the sojourning foreigners, unto nothing else, were devoting their leisure, than to be telling or hearing, something newer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Paul taking his stand in the midst of the Hill of Mars, saidYe men of Athens! In every way, how unusually reverent of the demons ye are, I perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, passing through, and carefully observing your objects of devotion, I found an altar also, in which was inscribedUnto an Unknown God. What, therefore, not knowing, ye reverence, the same, do, I, declare unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God that made the world and all things that are therein, the same, being, Lord, of heaven and earth, not in hand-made shrines, doth dwell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor, by human hands, is waited upon, as though in want of anything, himself, giving unto all life and breath and all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>he made also, of one, every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth,marking out fitting opportunities, and the bounds of their dwelling place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they might be seeking Godif, after all, indeed, they might feel after him and find him,although, in truth, he is already not far from any one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For, in him, we live and move and are: as, even some of your own poets, have saidFor, his offspring also, we are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being, then, offspring, of God, we ought not to be supposing that, unto gold or silver or stone, graven by art and device of man, the Divine, is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The times of ignorance, therefore, overlooking, God, as things now are, is charging all men everywhere to repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>inasmuch as he hath appointed a day, in which he is about to be judging the habitable earth in righteousness, by a man whom he hath pointed out,offering faith unto all, by raising him from among the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, when they heard of raising the dead, some, indeed, began to mock, while, others, saidWe will hear thee, concerning this, even again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus, Paul, came forth out of their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But, certain persons, joining themselves unto him, believed; among whom were even Dionysius the Mars-hill judge, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
