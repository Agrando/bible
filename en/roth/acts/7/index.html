The God of Glory, appeared unto our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And said unto himGet thee forth, out of thy land, and from among thy kindred, and come unto the land which, unto thee, I will point out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then, coming forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran; and, from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, in which, ye, now dwell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And gave him no inheritance therein, not even a place to set his foot on; and yet promised to give it unto him in possession, and unto his seed after him, when as yet he had not a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But God, spake thusHis seed shall be a sojourner in a foreign land, and they will bring it into bondage, and ill-treat it four-hundred years;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, the nation unto which they shall be in bondage, will, I, judgesaid God; and, after these things, shall they come forth, and render divine service unto me, in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he gave unto him a covenant of circumcision; and, thus, he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, the patriarchs, being jealous of Joseph, gave him up into Egypt; and, God, was, with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And rescued him out of all his tribulations, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he appointed him governor over Egypt and all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there came a famine upon all Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers could not find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Jacob, hearing there was corn in Egypt, sent off our fathers, first;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, the second time, Joseph was made known unto his brethren, and, the race of Joseph was made, manifest, unto Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph, sending forth, called for Jacob his father, and all the kindred, consisting of seventy-five souls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jacob went down  into Egypt . And he died, he, and our fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And were brought over into Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased, for a price of silver, of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, just as the time of the promise was drawing near wherewith God had agreed with Abraham, the people grew, and were multiplied in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Until there arose another sort of king over Egypt, who had not known Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The same, dealing craftily with our race, ill-treated our fathers, so as to cause their babes to be exposed, to the end they might not be suffered to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In which season, Moses, was born, and was exceeding goodly,who was nourished up three months in the house of his father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, when he was exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh rescued him, and nourished him for herself, as a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, so Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in his words and works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, when there was being fulfilled unto him a period of forty years, it came up on his heart to look after his brethren the sons of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, seeing one being wronged, he defended him, and avenged him that was getting worn out, smiting the Egyptian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he supposed his brethren would understand that, God, through his hand, would give them deliverance; whereas they understood not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On the following day also, he appeared unto them, as they were contending, and would have reconciled them in peace, sayingMen! ye are, brothers! Wherefore wrong ye one another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, he that was wronging his neighbour, thrust him away, sayingWho hath appointed, thee, to be ruler and judge over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Art, thou, wishing, to kill me, in the same way thou didst kill, yesterday, the Egyptian?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, when forty years were fulfilled, there appeared unto him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, a messenger, in a flame of fire, in a bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, Moses, seeing it, marvelled at the sight; and, as he was going near to observe, there came a voice of the Lord</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I, am the God of thy fathers, The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. And Moses becoming, terrified, durst not observe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Lord said unto himLoose the sandals of thy feet; for, the place whereon thou art standing, is, hallowed ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I have, indeed seen, the ill-treatment of my people that is in Egypt, and, unto their groaning, have I hearkened, and have come down to rescue them. Now, therefore, come! I will send thee into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The same Moses whom they had refused, sayingWho hath appointed thee to be ruler and judge? the same, both as ruler and redeemer, did God send, by the hand of the messenger who had appeared unto him in the bush:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The same, led them forth, doing wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the desert, forty years:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The same, is the Moses that said unto the sons of IsraelA prophet, unto you, will God raise up, from among your brethren, like unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The same, is he that came to be in the assembly in the desert, with the messenger who was speaking with him in Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, he who welcomed living utterances, to give unto us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Unto whom, our fathers would not become obedient, but thrust him away, and turned in their hearts unto Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Saying unto AaronMake as gods who shall go before us; for, as for this Moses who brought us forth out of Egypt, we know not what hath befallen him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And so they fell to calf-making in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But God, turned, and delivered them up to be doing divine service unto the host of heaven,just as it is written in a book of the prophetsVictims and sacrifices did ye offer unto me, forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Nay! but ye took with you the tent of Moloch, and the star of the god Rephan,the forms which ye made to bow down unto them: therefore will I carry you away beyond Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The tent of witness, was with our fathers in the desert, according as he who was speaking unto Moses, gave instructions, to make it, according to the model which he had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Which our fathers succeeding to, also brought in, with Joshua, when taking possession of the nations, which God put out from before our fathers until the days of David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who found favour before God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But, Solomon, built him a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Although indeed, the Most High, not in hand-made places, dwelleth; just as, the prophet, saith</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Heaven is my thrown, and, the earth, is my footstool: What manner of house, will ye build me, saith the Lord,Or what shall be the place of my resting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Hath not, my hand, made all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts and in ears, ye, always, against the Holy Spirit, do strive! As your fathers, ye also:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Which of the prophets, did not your fathers persecute? Yea they slew them who declared beforehand concerning the coming of the Righteous Oneof whom, now, ye, have become, betrayers and murderers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Who, indeed, received the law through ranks of messengers,and guarded it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And, while they were hearing these things, they were being pierced in their hearts, and began gnashing their teeth against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he, being already full of Holy Spirit, looking steadfastly into heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And saidLo! I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man, standing, on the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And, crying out with a loud voice, they held their ears, and rushed with one accord upon him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And, thrusting him forth outside the city, proceeded to stone him. And, the witnesses, laid their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they stoned Stephen, as he was invoking and sayingLord Jesus! give welcome unto my spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And, kneeling down, he cried out with a loud voiceLord! do not charge against them, this sin. And, having said this, he fell asleep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
