For, I, not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem, am ready, in behalf of the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, as he was not to be persuaded, we ceased, sayingthe Lords, will be done!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, after these days, making ready what we had, we started to go up unto Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and there went certain also of the disciples from Caesarea, along with us, who were to introduce us unto one with whom we might be entertained, one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, when we came to Jerusalem, the brethren, gladly welcomed us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, on the next day, Paul went in with us unto James, and, all the elders, were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, saluting them, he went on to narrate, one by one, each of the things which God had wrought among the nations through his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, they, having heard, began glorifying God; and they said to himThou observest, brother, how many myriads there are among the Jews who have believed, and, all, are zealous for the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now they have heard it rumoured concerning thee, that, an apostacy, art thou teaching, from Moses, unto all the Jews, who are among the nations, telling them not to be circumcising their children, nor, by the customs, to be walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What, then, is it? at all events, they will hear that thou hast come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This, then, do, which unto thee, we say:We have four men who have a vow upon themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Taking these unto thee, be purified with them, and spend something upon them, that they may shave their head; and all will get to know, that the things which they have heard rumoured concerning thee, are, nothing,on the contrary, thou thyself, dost keep the ranks, guarding the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, concerning them of the nations who have believed, we ourselves, sent, deciding that they should be guarding themselves, both as to idol sacrifice, and blood, and what is strangled, and fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul, taking unto him the men, on the next day, with them, being purified, began entering into the temple to declare the filling up of the days of the purificationuntil, the offering, had been presented for each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When, however, the seven days were on the point of being concluded, the Jews from Asia, observing him in the temple, began to urge-on all the multitude, and thrust upon them their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>crying outIsraelites! be giving help!
