Hear ye, the defence, which I now make unto you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And, when they heard that, in the Hebrew language, he had begun to address them, they kept the more quiet. And he saith</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I, am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but nurtured in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel,trained after the strictness of our ancestral law; being jealous for God just as, all ye, are this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and, this way, I persecuted unto the death, binding and delivering up into prisons both men and women:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>as, even the High-priest, beareth me witness, and all the Eldership,from whom, letters also, accepting to the brethren, unto Damascus, was I journeying, to bring them who were there bound unto Jerusalem, that they might be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it befell me, as I was journeying and drawing nigh unto Damascus, that, about mid-daysuddenlyout of heaven, there flashed a great light all around me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I fell also to the ground, and heard a voice saying unto meSaul! Saul! Why, me, art thou persecuting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, I, answeredWho art thou, Lord? And he said unto meI, am Jesus the Nazarene, whom, thou, art persecuting!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, they who were with me, beheld, indeed, the light, but heard not, the voice, of him that was speaking with me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And saidWhat shall I do, Lord? And, the Lord, said unto meArise, and be going thy way into Damascus, and, there, shall it be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, as I could not see clearly owing to the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them who were with me, I came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, one Ananias, a man devout according to the law, well-attested by all the Jews that dwelt there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>coming unto me, and standing over me, saidSaul, brother! look up. And, I, in that very hour, looked up on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he saidThe God of our fathers, hath chosen thee to get to know his will, and to see the Righteous One,and to hear a voice out of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because thou shalt be a witness to him unto all men, of the things which thou hast seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, now, what art thou going to do? Arise, and get thyself immersed, and have thy sins bathed away, calling upon his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, when had returned unto Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, that I came to be in a trance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and saw him, saying unto meHaste thee, and go forth speedily out of Jerusalem, inasmuch as they will not accept thy witness concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, I, saidLord! they themselves, well know that I was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue them who were believing on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, when the blood of Stephen thy witness was being shed, even I myself, was standing by, and approving, and guarding the mantles of them who were slaying him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said unto me-Be taking thy journey; because, I, unto nations afar off, will send thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they hearkened unto him as far as this word, and lifted up their voice, sayingAway from the earth, with such a man as this, for it is not fit that he should live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, as they were both making an outcry and tearing their mantles,dust, also were throwing into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the captain ordered him to be brought into the castle, saying, that, with scourging, he should be put to the test,that he might find out, for what cause they were, thus, clamouring against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, when they had stretched him out with straps, Paul said unto the by-standing centurionA Roman, and uncondemned, is it allowed you to be scourging?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, when the centurion heard   , he went unto the captain, and reported, sayingWhat art thou going to do? For, this man, is, a Roman?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the captain, coming up, said to himTell me! Art, thou, a, Roman? And, he, saidYea!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the captain answeredI, for a large sum, this citizenship acquired! And, Paul, saidBut, I, am even,   born!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Straightway, therefore, they who were about to put him to the test, withdrew from him; and, even the captain, was struck with fear, when he found out he was, a Roman, and because, him, he had bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, on the morrow, being minded to get to know the certainty as to why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him, and ordered the High-priests and all the High-council to come together; and, bringing down Paul, set him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
