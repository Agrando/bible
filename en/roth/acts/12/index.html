And his chains fell off out of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the messenger said unto himGird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto himThrow around thee thy mantle, and be following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, coming out, he began following, and knew not that it was true which was coming about through means of the messenger; but supposed that, a vision, he was beholding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, passing through the first ward and the second, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city, the which, of its own accord, opened unto them; and, coming out, they went on through one street, and, straightway, the messenger was parted from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, Peter, coming to himself saidNow, know I, of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his messenger, and taken me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, considering the matter, he came unto the house of Mary, the mother who was surnamed Mark, where a considerable number were gathered together and praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, when he had knocked at the door of the porch, there came unto it a maiden to hearken, by name Rhoda;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, recognizing the voice of Peter, by reason of her joy, she opened not the porch,but, running in, bare tidings that Peter was standing before the porch. But, they, unto her, saidThou art raving</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She, however, kept on strongly declaring that, so, it was. But, they, were sayingIt is his, messenger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, Peter, continued knocking; and, opening, they saw him, and were amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, making a sign to them with his hand to hold their peace, he related to them how, the Lord, had brought, him, forth out of the prison; and he saidCarry tidings unto James and the brethren, as to these things. And, going out, he went his way unto some other place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, when it became day, there was no small commotion among the soldiers, as to what, then, Peter had become!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, Herod, seeking after and not finding, him, having examined the guards, ordered them to be led away</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now he was bitterly hostile to them of Tyre and Zidon; but, with one accord, they came unto him, and, persuading Blastus, who was over the bed-chamber of the king, they were suing for peace; because their country was fed by the kings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, on an appointed day, Herod, putting on royal apparel, and seating himself upon the tribunal, proceeded to deliver an oration unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, the populace, began to shoutA gods, voice, and not, a mans!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, instantly, there smote him, a messenger of the Lord, because he gave not the glory unto God; and, becoming worm-eaten, he expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, the word of the Lord, went on growing and multiplying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, Barnabas and Saul, returned unto Jerusalem, fulfilling the ministering, taking with them John who was surnamed Mark.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
