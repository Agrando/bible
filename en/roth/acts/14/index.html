And he sprang up, and began to walk about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, the multitudes, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voice, in the speech of LycaoniaThe gods, made like unto men, have come down unto us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went on to call Barnabas, Jupiter, and Paul, Mercury, seeing that, he, was the leader of discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also, the priest of the Jupiter that was before the city, bringing bulls and garlands unto the gates, with the multitudes, would have offered sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, hearing of it, rending asunder their own mantles, sprang forward amidst the multitude, crying aloud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and sayingMen! Why, these things, are ye doing? We also, of like nature with you, are men, bringing you the good news, that from these vain things, ye should be turning unto a living God:Who made heaven and the earth and the sea and all things therein;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who in the bygone generations suffered all the nations to be going on in their own ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Although, not without witness, he left himself, doing good, from heaven, upon you, giving rain and fruitful seasons, filling, with food and gladness, your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even these things, saying, scarcely restrained they the multitudes from offering sacrifice unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, and, persuading the multitudes, and stoning Paul, they dragged him outside the city, supposing him to be dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Howbeit, the disciples surrounding him, he rose up, and entered into the city. And, on the morrow, he went forth, with Barnabas, unto Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Delivering the good news unto that city also, and making a good number of disciples, they returned unto Lystra, and unto Iconium, and unto Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>confirming the souls of the disciples, beseeching them to abide in the faith, and   that, through many tribulations, must we enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover, appointing unto them by vote, in each assembly, elders, praying with fastings, they commended them unto the Lord on whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, passing through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and, speaking in Perga the word, they came down unto Attalia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and, from thence, they set sail for Antioch, whence they had been given up unto the favour of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, when they had arrived and gathered together the assembly, they began recounting how many things God had done with them, and that he had opened, unto the nations, a door of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they spent no little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
