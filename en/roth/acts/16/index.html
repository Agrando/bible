And we were, in this city, spending certain days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and on the day of rest, we went forth outside the gate, beside a river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer,and, sitting down, we went on to speak unto the women who had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, devout towards God, was hearkening, whose heart, the Lord, fully opened, to be giving heed unto the things being spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, when she was immersed, and her house, she besought</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, as we were on our way unto the place of prayer, a certain damsel, having a spirit of Python, met us,who, indeed, much gain, was presenting unto her masters, by divining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The same, following after Paul and us, kept crying aloud, sayingThese men, are servants of the Most High God,who, indeed, are declaring unto you a way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, this, she continued to do for many days. But Paul, worn out, and turning unto the spirit, saidI charge thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out from her. And it came out the same hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, her masters, seeing that their hope of gain had gone out, laying hold on Paul and Silas, dragged them into the market-place, unto the rulers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and, leading them forward unto the magistrates, saidThese men, are exceedingly troubling our city, they, being Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And are declaring customs, which it is not allowable for us either to accept or to observe, being Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the multitude rose up together against them, and, the magistrates, rending off them their mantles, were giving orders to beat them with rods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and, laying upon them many stripes, they thrust them into prison, charging the prison-keeper, safely, to be keeping them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who, a charge like this receiving, thrust them into the inner prison, and, their feet, made he fast in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, at midnight, Paul and Silas, being at prayer, began singing praise unto God; and the prisoners unto them, did hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, suddenly, a great earthquake took place,so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, and all the doors were  instantly  set open, and the bonds of all were unfastened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, the prison-keeper, being wakened and seeing that the doors of the prison had been opened, drawing his sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to have fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul called out with a loud voice, sayingBy no means, do thyself harm, for we are, one and all, here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, asking for a light, he sprang in, and becoming, agitated, fell down unto Paul and Silas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and, leading them forth outside, saidSirs! what must I be doing, that I may be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, they, saidBelieve on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou, and thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spake unto him the word of God, with all who were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, taking them with him, in that hour of the night, he bathed them from their stripes, and was immersed, he, and his, one and all, on the spot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and, leading them up into his house, he set near a table,and exulted, having, with all his house, believed in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And. when day came. the magistrates sent off the constables sayingLet those men go!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the prison-keeper reported the words unto PaulThe magistrates have sent, that ye be let go. Now, therefore, going forth, be taking your journey in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, Paul, said unto themBeating us, in public, uncondemned, men that are Romans, they thrust us into prison;and, now, by stealth, are they thrusting us forth? Nay, verily! but let them come, themselves, and lead us out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the constables reported unto the magistrates these words; and they were struck with fear, when they heard that they were, Romans;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and came, and besought them, and, leading them out, went on to request them to depart from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And so, coming forth from the prison, they went unto Lydia, and, seeing the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
