The same, calling for Barnabas and Saul, sought to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the magician,for so, when translated, is his name,withstood them; seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul, who is also Paul, filled with Holy Spirit, looking steadfastly at him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>SaidO full of all guile, and all recklessness! Son of an adversary! Enemy of all righteousness!Wilt thou not cease to pervert the straight ways of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, therefore, lo! the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun, until a fitting time. And, instantly, there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and, going about, he was seeking such as might lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then, the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, setting sail from Paphos, Pauls company came into Perga of Pamphylia; but, John, withdrawing from them, returned unto Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They, however, passing through from Perga, arrived at Antioch of Pisidia; and, going into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, after the reading of the law and the prophets, the synagogue-rulers sent unto them, sayingBrethren! if there is in you a word of exhortation unto the people, say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Paul, standing up, and making a sign with his hand, saidYe men of Israel! and such as revere God! hearken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people Israel, chose our fathers, and, the people, he exalted, by their sojourn in the land of Egypt,and, with a high arm, brought he them out of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, for the time of about forty years, bare with their manners in the desert;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, overthrowing seven nations in the land of Canaan, gave them their land as an inheritanceabout four hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, after these things, he gave them judges, until Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, from that time, they asked for themselves a king, and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, during forty years;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, setting him aside, raised up, David, unto them for king,of whom he also said, bearing witnessI have found David, the son of Jesse, a man  according to my heart, who will do all my will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>From this mans seed, hath God, according to promise, brought unto Israel, a saviourJesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>John, beforehand proclaiming, before the face of his coming in, an immersion of repentance, unto all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, as John was fulfilling his course, he was sayingWhom are ye supposing that I am? I, am not he! But lo! there cometh, after me, one of whom I am not worthy, the sandals of his feet, to loosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Brethren! sons of the race of Abraham, and those who among you revere God,unto you, hath this word of salvation been sent forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, they who were dwelling in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not recognising him, have, by judging him, fulfilled, the very voices of the prophets which every sabbath are being read;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, though no single cause of death they found, yet claimed they of Pilate that he should be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, when they had finished all those things which, concerning him, had been written, taking him down from the tree, they put him in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, God, raised him from among the dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who appeared, during many days, unto them who had come up with him from Galilee unto Jerusalem; who, indeed,  now  are his witnesses unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We, therefore, unto you, bring the good news, as to the promise which, unto our fathers, was made,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>That God hath fulfilled, the same, for our children, by raising up Jesus: as also, in the second psalm, it is writtenMy son, art, thou: I, this day, have begotten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, in that he raised him from among the dead, no more destined to return unto corruption, on this wise hath he spokenI will give unto you the faithful lovingkindnesses of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Wherefore also, in a different   , he saithThou wilt not give thy man of lovingkindness to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For, David, indeed, unto his own generation having done service, by the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was added unto fathers, and saw corruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, he whom God hath raised, did not see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Be it known unto you, therefore, brethren,that, through this man, unto you, remission of sins is declared;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, from all things from which ye could not, by the law of Moses, be justified, by this man, everyone that believeth, is justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Be taking heed, therefore, lest that come upon you which hath been spoken in the prophets</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>See, ye despisers, and marvel, and disappear: in that, a work, am, I, working in your days,a work, which in nowise will ye believe, though one relate it in full unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, as they were going out, they kept on beseeching that, on the ensuing sabbath, might be spoken unto them these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And, when the congregation was broken up, there followed many of the Jews, and of the devout proselytes, with Paul and Barnabas; who, indeed, in speaking unto them, went on persuading them to abide in the favour of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, on the coming sabbath, almost all the city, was gathered together, to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But, the Jews, seeing, the multitudes, were filled with jealousy,and began speaking against the things which, by Paul, were being spoken, defaming them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly, saidUnto you, was it necessary, that the word of God should first be spoken: seeing ye are thrusting it from you, and, unworthy, are judging yourselves of the age-abiding life, lo! we turn unto the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so hath the Lord commanded usI have set thee for a light of nations, that thou mayest be for salvation unto the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And they of the nations, hearing   , began to rejoice, and to be glorifying God, and they believedas many as had become disposed for life age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the word of the Lord went on to be carried through the whole country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But, the Jews, urged on the devout women of the higher class, and the chief men of the city, and roused up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas,and thrust them out from their bounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But they, shaking off the dust of their feet against them, came into Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And, the disciples, were filled with joy, and with Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
