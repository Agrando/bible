I perceive that, with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and of the ship, but even of our persons, shall the voyage certainly be attended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, the centurion, by the master, and by the shipowner, was more persuaded than by the things which, by Paul, were spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, the harbour being, incommodious, to winter in, the more part, advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they might be able to reach Phoenix, to winter,   a harbour of Crete, looking north-east and south-east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, a south wind blowing softly, supposing they had secured their purpose, weighing anchor, they began to sail close in shore along Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, after no long time, there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, called Euraquilo,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and, the ship being caught and we not being able to bring her head to the wind, we let her go, and were borne along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, running under the lee, of some small island, called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to make ourselves masters of the boat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>which, hoisting up, they began to use, helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest, on the sand-bank of Africa, they should run aground, lowering the gear, so, were they borne along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, we being exceedingly tempest-tossed, on the next day, they began to throw   overboard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and, on the third day, with their own hands, the tackling of the ship, they cast away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, neither, sun nor stars, appearing for many days, and, no small tempest, lying upon us, in the end, all hope that we should be saved, began to be taken from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, when they had been, long without food, then, Paul, standing in the midst of them, saidYe ought, indeed, Sir! yielding to me, not to have sailed away from Crete, to get this damage and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, now, I recommend you to be of good courage; for, loss of life, shall there be, none at all, from among you,only the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there stood by me this night, belonging unto the God whose I am, unto whom also I am doing divine service, a messenger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>sayingBe not afraid, Paul! for, before Caesar, must thou needs stand. And lo! God hath granted to thee as a favour, all them who are sailing with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore, be of good courage, Sirs; for I believe in Godthat, so, it shall be, according as it hath been told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Upon a certain island, however, must we needs be wrecked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, when, the fourteenth night, had come, and we were being driven to and fro in the Adriatic, about midnight, the sailors suspected that some country was, nearing, them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and, sounding, they found twenty fathoms,and, going a little further, and again sounding, they found fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, fearing lest haply, on rocky places, we should be wrecked, out of stern, cast they four anchors,and began praying that day might dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, when, the sailors, were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, by pretext, as though out of the prow they had been about to reach anchors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said unto the centurion, and unto the soldiersExcept, these, abide in the ship, ye yourselves, cannot be saved!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then, the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, until day was about to dawn, Paul continued to beseech one and all to take some food, sayingThis day is, the fourteenth day, that, suspense, fasting, ye are completing,having helped yourselves, to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wherefore, I beseech you to take some food,for, this, lays a foundation for your safety; for, of no one of you, shall a hair of the head perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, having said these things, and taken a loaf, he gave thanks unto God before all, and, breaking it, began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, all becoming, of good cheer, they also, helped themselves to food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now we were, in the ship, in all, about seventy-six souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, when they were satisfied with food, they began lightening the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, when day came, they could not recognise, the land; but perceived, a certain bay, having a beach,upon which they were minded, if they could, safely to bring the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And, casting off the anchors, they let them go into the sea,at the same time, loosening the lashings of the rudders, and, hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But, falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and, the foreship sticking fast, remained immoveable, while, the stern, began to break up, from the violence   .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now, the soldiers counsel, turned out to be, that they should kill, the prisoners, lest any one should swim out and escape;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but, the centurion, being minded to bring Paul safely through, hindered them of their purpose, and ordered such as were able to swim, to cast themselves overboard and, get first to the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and, the rest, some, on planks, and, some, on other things from the ship, and, so, it came to pass, that, all, were brought safely through, on to the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
