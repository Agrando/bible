This Jesus who hath been taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye yourselves have gazed upon him going into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then returned they into Jerusalem, from a mountain called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem a Sabbath days journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, when they had entered, into the upper-story went they up, where remained behindboth Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the zealot, and Judas the son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These all were giving constant attention with one accord unto the prayer, with  certain  women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, in these days, Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said,and there was a multitude of names, of one accord, about a hundred and twenty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Brethren! It was needful for the Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spake beforehand through the mouth of David, concerning Judas,who became guide unto them who apprehended Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For that he had come to be reckoned among us and obtained the lot of this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This man therefore had possessed himself of a field out of the reward of unrighteousness,and falling headlong burst asunder in the midst, and forth gushed all his bowels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known unto all them who were dwelling in Jerusalem, so that that field was called, in their language, Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his encampment become desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein! Andhis overseership, let a different man take!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is needful then that, of the men who companied with us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out over us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Beginning from the immersion by John until the day when he was taken up from us, that, a witness of his resurrection along with us, should one of these become.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they appointed two,Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, praying, they saidThou Lord! observer of the hearts of all men! shew forth whom thou hast chosen,of these two, one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas went aside, to go his way unto his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
