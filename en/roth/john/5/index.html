I have, no man, that, as soon as the water hath been troubled, might thrust me into the pool; but, while, I, am coming, another, before me, goeth down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus saith unto himRise! take up thy couch, and be walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, straightway, the man was made well and took up his couch, and began to walk. Now it was Sabbath, on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Jews, therefore, were saying, unto him who had been curedIt is, Sabbath; and it is not allowable for thee to take up thy couch:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who, however, answered themHe that made me well, he, unto me, saidTake up thy couch, and be walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They questioned himWho is the man that said unto thee, Take up   , and be walking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, the healed one, knew not, who, it was; for, Jesus, had turned aside, a multitude, being in the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After these things, Jesus findeth him, in the temple, and said unto himSee! thou hast become, well:No more, be committing sin, lest, some worse thing, do thee befall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The man went away, and told the Jews, that it was, Jesus, who had made him well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, on this account, were the Jews persecuting Jesus, because, these things, he had been doing, on Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, he, answered themMy Father, until even now, is working; and, I, am working.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On this account, therefore, the rather, were the Jews seeking to slay him,because, not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but was calling God, his own Father, making, himself, equal, with, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus, therefore, answered, and went on to say unto themVerily, verily, I say unto you: The Son cannot be doing, of himself, a single thing,save anything he may see, the Father, doing; for, whatsoever, he, may be doing, these things, the Son also, in like manner, doeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, the Father, dearly loveth the Son, and, all things, pointeth out to him, which, himself, is doing; and, greater works than these, will he point out to him, that, ye, may marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, just as the Father waketh up the dead, and quickeneth them, in like manner, the Son also, whom he pleaseth, doth quicken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For neither doth, the Father, judge anyone,but, all the judging, hath given unto the Son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That, all, may honour the Son, just as they honour the Father: he that doth not honour the Son, doth not, in fact, honour the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you: He that heareth, my word, and believeth in him that sent me, hath life age-abiding, and, into judgment, cometh not, but hath passed over, out of death into life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you: There cometh an hour, and now is, when, the dead, shall hearken unto the voice of the Son of God, and, they who have hearkened, shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For, just as, the Father, hath life, in himself, in like manner, unto the Son also, hath he given, life, to have, in himself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, authority, hath he given him, to be executing, judgment,because, Son of Man, is he!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not be marvelling at this: because there come an hour, in which, all they in the tombs, shall hearken unto his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and shall come forth,they who, the good things, have done, unto a resurrection, of life; but, they who the corrupt things, have practised, unto a resurrection, of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I, cannot be doing, of myself, a single thing,Just as I hear, I judge; and, my judging, is, just,because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If, I, bear witness, concerning myself, my witness, is not, true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another, it is, who beareth witness concerning me,and I know that, true, is the witness which he witnesseth concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Ye, have sent forth unto John,and he hath borne witness to the truth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I, however, not from man, my witness, receive; but, these things, I say, that, ye, may be saved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He, was the burning and shining lamp, and, ye, were willing to exult, for an hour, in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But, I, have, as my witness, something greater than Johns; for, the works which the Father hath given me, that I should complete them,the works themselves which I am doing, bear witness concerning me, that, the Father, hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And so, the Father who sent me, he, hath borne witness concerning me; Neither, a sound of him, at any time, have ye heard, nor, a form of him, have ye seen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, his word, ye have not, within you abidingbecause, as touching him whom, he, sent, in him, ye, believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ye search the Scriptures, because, ye, think, by them, to have, life age-abiding; and, those   , are they which bear witness concerning me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And yet ye choose not to come unto me, that, life, ye may have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Glory from men, am I not receiving;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But I have taken knowledge of you, that, the love of God, ye have not, in yourselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I, have come, in the name of my Father,and ye are not receiving me: If, another, shall come in his own name, him, ye will receive!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How can, ye, believe,Glory from one another, receiving; and, the glory which is from the only God, are not seeking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Do not think that, I, will accuse you unto the Father: There, is, who accuseth you, even, Moses,on whom, ye, have set your hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For, if ye had been believing, in Moses, ye would, in that case, have been believing, in me: for, concerning me, he wrote.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But, if, in his writings, ye are not believing, how, in my sayings, will ye believe?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
