If one walk in the day, he doth no stumble, because, the light of this world, he seeth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, if one walk in the night, he stumbleth, because, the light, is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things, he said, and, after this, he saith unto themLazarus, our dear friend, hath fallen asleep; but I am going, that I may awake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The disciples, therefore, said unto himLord! if he have fallen asleep, he will recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jesus had spoken concerning his death; whereas, they, supposed that, concerning the taking of rest in sleep, he had been speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus, therefore, then, said unto them, plainly,Lazarus, died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I rejoice, for your sakethat ye may believe,that I was not there; but let us be going unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thomas, therefore, the one called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciplesLet, us also, be going, that we may die with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus, therefore, coming, found that, four days already, had he been in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and, many from among the Jews, had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might console them concerning their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him; but, Mary, in the house, remained sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Martha, therefore, said unto JesusLord! if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, now, I know, that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God, will give unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus saith unto herThy brother shall rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise, in the resurrection, in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said unto herI, am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, even though he die, shall live again!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, no one who liveth again and believeth on me, shall in anywise die, unto times age-abiding. Believest thou this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She saith unto himYea, Lord! I, have believed, that, thou, art the Christ, the Son of God,He who, into the world, should come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And this saying, she went away, and called Mary her sister, secretly, sayingThe teacher, is present, and calleth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, she, when she heard, was roused up quickly, and was coming unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Not yet, however, had Jesus come into the village, but was still in the place where, Martha, met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house and consoling her, seeing Mary, that quickly she arose and went out, followed her, supposing that she was withdrawing unto the tomb, that she might weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying unto himLord! if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, was indignant in the spirit, and troubled himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and saidWhere have ye laid him? They say unto himLord! come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Jews, therefore, were sayingSee! how tenderly he loved him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, some from among them, saidCould not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that, this one also, should not have died?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus, therefore, again, being indignant within himself, cometh unto the tomb. Now it was a cave, and, a stone, was lying thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus, saith, Take ye away the stone! Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith unto himLord! by this time, he stinketh, for it is, four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus saith unto herSaid I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they took away the stone. And, Jesus, lifted up his eyes on high, and saidFather! I thank thee, thou didst hear me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I, indeed, knew that, always, unto me, thou dost hearken; but, for the sake of the multitude standing around, I spake,that they might believe that, thou, didst send me forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And, these things, having said, with a loud voice, he cried outLazarus! Come forth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He that was dead came forth, bound feet and hands with bandages, and, his face, with a napkin, was bound about. Jesus saith unto themLoose him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many therefore from among the Jews, who had come unto Mary, and gazed on what he did, believed on him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>but, certain from among them, went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The High-priests and Pharisees, therefore, brought together a high-council, and were sayingWhat are we to do, in that, this man, doeth, many signs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him alone thus, all, will believe on him, and the Romans will come, and take away, both our place and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But, a certain one from among them, Caiaphas, being, High-priest, for that year, said unto themYe, know, nothing at all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>nor do ye take into account, that it is profitable for you that, one man, should die for the people, and not, the whole nation, perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>This, however, from himself, he spake not, but, being, High-priest, for that year, he prophesied, that Jesus was about to die for the nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and, not for the nation only, but that, the scattered children of God also, he might gather together into one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>From that day, therefore, they took counsel, that they might put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus, therefore, no longer openly, was walking among the Jews, but departed thence, into the country near the desert, unto a city called, Ephraim; and, there, abode, with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up unto Jerusalem, out of the country, before the passover, that they might purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They were therefore seeking Jesus, and were saying one to another, in the temple, standingHow seemeth it unto you? that he will in nowise come unto the feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the High-priests and the Pharisees had given commands, that, if anyone came to know where he was, he should inform</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
