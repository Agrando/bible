They say unto himWe also, go with thee! They went out, and got up into the boat, and during that night, they caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But, morning by this time drawing on, Jesus stood upon the beach; nevertheless, the disciples knew not that it was, Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus, therefore, saith unto themChildren! perhaps ye have nothing to eat? They answered himNo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, he, said unto themCast the net, on the right side of the boat,and ye shall find. They cast, therefore; and, no longer, were they able, to draw, it, for the multitude of the fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That disciple, therefore, whom Jesus loved, saith unto PeterIt is, the Lord! Simon Peter, therefore, hearing that it was the Lord, girded about him, his upper garment,for he was naked; and cast himself into the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but, the other disciples, came, by the little boat,for they were not farther from the land than about two hundred cubits off,dragging the net of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So, when they got out upon the land, they behold a coal fire lying, and fish lying over, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus saith unto themBring of the fish which ye caught just now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter, therefore, went on board, and drew the net on to the land,full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and, though they were so many, the net was not rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus saith unto themCome! break your fast. Not one, of the disciples was venturing to ask him, Who art, thou? knowing that it was, the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth unto them; and the fish, in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This, already, is the third time Jesus was manifested unto the disciples, after he was raised from among the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When, therefore, they had broken their fast, Jesus saith unto Simon PeterSimon, son of John! lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto himYea, Lord! thou, knowest that I am fond of thee, he saith unto himBe feeding my lambs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He saith unto him, again, the second timeSimon, son of John! lovest thou me? He saith unto himYea, Lord! thou, knowest that I am fond of thee. He saith unto himBe shepherding my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He saith unto him, the third timeSimon, son of John! art thou fond of me? Peter was grieved, that he said unto him, the third time, Art thou fond of me? and he said unto himLord! all things, thou, knowest: thou perceivest that I am fond of thee. Jesus saith unto himBe feeding my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verily, verily, I say unto theeWhen thou wast younger, thou usedst to gird thyself, and to walk whither thou didst choose; but, when thou shalt become aged, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and, another, shall gird thee, and bear thee, whither thou dost not choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, this, he said, signifying, by what manner of death, he should glorify God. And, having said this, he saith unto himBe following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Peter, turning about, beholdeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following,who also reclined during the supper upon his breast, and saidLord, who is it that is delivering thee up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter, therefore, seeing, this one, saith unto JesusLord! and, this one, what?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus saith unto himIf I will that, he, remain until I come, what is that to thee? Thou, be following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This word, therefore, went forth unto the brethren, that, that disciple, should not die. Howbeit, Jesus did not tell him, he should not die; but, If I will that, he, remain until I come, what is that to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This, is the disciple who beareth witness concerning these things, and who hath written these things; and we know that, true, is, his witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there are many other things also, which Jesus did, which, indeed, if they were to be written one by one, not even the world, itself, I suppose, would contain, the books which must be written.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
