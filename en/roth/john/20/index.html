So then, as she wept, she stooped aside into the tomb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and beholdeth two messengers, in white garments, sitting, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where had been lying the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, they, say unto herWoman! why weepest thou? She saith unto themThey have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These things saying, she turned round, and seeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was, Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus saith unto herWoman! why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing he was, the gardener, saith unto himSir! If, thou, hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him; and, I, will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus saith unto herMary! She, turning saith unto him, in HebrewRabboni! which meaneth, Teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus saith unto herBe not detaining me, for, not yet, have I ascended unto the Father; but be going unto my disciples, and say unto themI am ascending unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary the Magdalene cometh, bringing tidings unto the disciplesI have seen the Lord! and that these things he had said unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It being late, therefore, on that day, the first of the week,and, the doors, having been made fast where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came, and stood in the midst, and saith unto themPeace be unto you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and, this, saying he pointed out both his hands and his side unto them. The disciples, therefore, rejoiced, seeing the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus, therefore, said unto them, again,Peace be unto you! Just as, my Father, sent me forth, I, also, send you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, this, saying, he breathed strongly, and saith unto themReceive ye Holy Spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whosesoever sins ye shall remit, they are remitted unto them, whosesoever ye shall retain, they are retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, Thomas, one of the twelve, the one called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples, therefore, were saying unto himWe have seen the Lord! But, he, said unto themExcept I see, in his hands, the print of the nails, and press my finger into the print of the nails, and press my hand into his side, in nowise will I believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, eight days after, his disciples again were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus comeththe doors having been made fastand stood in the midst, and saidPeace be unto you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then, saith he unto ThomasReach thy finger hither, and see my hands, and reach thy hand, and press into my side,and become not disbelieving, but believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered, and said unto himMy Lord, and my God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus saith unto himBecause thou hast seen me, hast thou believed? Happy, they who have not seen, and yet have believed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Many other signs, doubtless, did Jesus, in presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but, these, are written, that ye may believe that, Jesus, is, the Christ, the Son of God; and that, believing, ye may have life in his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
