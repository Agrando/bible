Not yet, hath come, mine hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother saith unto them who are ministeringWhatsoever he may say to you, do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were there, six stone water-vessels, placed, according to the purification of the Jews; holding each, two or three measures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus saith unto themFill the vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he saith unto themDraw out now, and be bearing unto the master of the feast. And they bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, when the master of the feast had tasted the water, now made, wine, and knew not whence it was,though, they who were ministering, knew, even they who had drawn out the water, the master accosteth the bridegroom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and saith unto himEvery man, first the good wine, setteth out; and, when they had been well-supplied, the inferior:Thou, hast kept the good wine until, even now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This, beginning of his signs, did Jesus, in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this, he came down into Capernaum,he, and his mother and brethren, and his disciples; and, there, they abode, not many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, near, was the passover of the Jews; and, Jesus, went up unto Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he found, in the temple, them that were selling oxen and sheep and doves, also the money-changers sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, making a scourge out of rushes, all of them, thrust he forth out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and, the money-changers small coins, poured he forth, and, the tables, he overturned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and unto them who were selling, the doves, he saidTake these things hence! Be not making, the house of my Father, a house of merchandise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His disciples remembered that it was writtenThe zeal of thy house, eateth me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews therefore answered, and said unto him, What sign, dost thou point out to us, in that, these things, thou doest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered, and said unto themTake down this shrine, and, in three days, will I raise it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jews, therefore, saidIn forty and six years, was this shrine built. And, thou, in three days, wilt raise it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, he, was speaking concerning the shrine of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When, therefore, he had been raised from among the dead, his disciples remembered, that, this, he had been saying; and they believed in the Scripture, and in the word which Jesus had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, when he was in Jerusalem, during the passover, during the feast, many, believed on his name, viewing his signs which he was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus himself, however, was not trusting himself unto them, by reason of his understanding them all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and because he had, no need, that anyone should bear witness concerning man; for, he, understood what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
