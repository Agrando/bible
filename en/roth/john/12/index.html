Blessed is he that is coming in the name of the Lord,even the King of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus, finding a young ass, took his seat thereon, just as it is written</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do not fear, O daughter of Zion! Lo! thy king, cometh, sitting upon the colt of an ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These things, his disciples noticed not, at the first; but, when Jesus was glorified, then, remembered they that, these things, had, for him, been written,and that, these things, they had done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The multitude, therefore, that was with him when he called, Lazarus, out of the tomb, and raised him from among the dead, was bearing witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On this account, the multitude met him also, because they heard that he had done, this sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the Pharisees, therefore, said among themselvesYe observe that ye are profiting nothing: See! the world, after him, hath gone away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were certain Greeks, from among them who were coming up that they might worship in the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These, therefore, came unto Philip, him who was from Bethsaida of Galilee,and were requesting him, sayingSir! We desire to see, Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew: Andrew and Philip come, and tell Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, Jesus, answereth them, sayingThe hour hath come, that the Son of Man should be glorified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Verily! Verily, I say unto you: Except, the kernel of wheat, shall fall into the ground, and die, it, alone, abideth; but, if it die, much fruit, it beareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He that loveth his life, loseth it; but, he that hateth his life, in this world, unto life age-abiding, shall guard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If, with me, anyone be ministering, with me, let him be following; and, where, I, am, there, my minister also, shall be. If anyone, with me, be ministering, the Father, will honour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now, is my soul troubled,and what can I say? Father! save me from this hour? But, on this account, came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There came, therefore, a voice out of heavenI both have glorified it, and will glorify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So , the multitude that was standing by, and heard it, were sayingIt hath, thundered. Others, were sayingA messenger, unto him, hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered, and saidNot for my sake, hath this voice come, but, for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now, is there, a judging, of this world,Now, the ruler of this world, shall be cast out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw, all, unto myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But, this, he was saying, signifying, by what manner of death, he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The multitude, therefore, answered himWe, have heard, out of the law, that, the Christ, abideth evermore; How then dost, thou, say,It behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus, therefore, said unto themYet a little while, the light, is, among you: Walk, while ye have, the light, lest, darkness, on you should lay hold; and, he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he drifteth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While, the light, ye have, believe on the light, that, sons of light, ye may become. These things, spake Jesus,and, departing, was hid from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, although such signs, as these, he had done before them, they were not believing on him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that, the word of Isaiah the prophet, might be fulfilled, which saidLord! who believed, what we have heard? And, the arm of the Lord, to whom, was it revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>On this account, they could not believe, because, again, said Isaiah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; lest they should see with their eyes, and should understand with their heart, and should turn,and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things, said Isaiah, because he saw his glory, and spake concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless, however, even from among the rulers, many believed on him; but, because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing him, lest, excommunicants from the synagogue, they should be made;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the glory of men, more than the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, Jesus, cried aloud, and saidHe that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, he that vieweth me, vieweth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I, a light, into the world have come, that, no one who believeth on me, in darkness, should abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, if anyone shall hearken unto my sayings, and not guard them, I, am not judging him; for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that setteth me aside, and receiveth not my sayings, hath that which is to judge him: The word that I spake, that, will judge him, in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because, I, out of myself, spake not, but, the Father who sent me, hath, himself, given me commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that, his commandment, is, life age-abiding; The things, therefore, which I speak, just as the Father hath told me, so, I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
