Now there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, to the number of about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus therefore took the loaves, and, giving thanks, went on distributing unto them that reclined; in like manner, of the small fishes also: as much as they were wishing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, when they were well-filled, he saith unto his disciplesGather up the broken pieces left over, that nothing be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets, with broken pieces out of the five barley loaves,which were left over by them who had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The people, therefore, seeing what signs he wrought, began to sayThis, is, of a truth, the prophet who was to come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus, therefore, getting to know that they were about to come, and seize him, that they might make him king, retired again into the mountain, himself, alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and, entering into a boat, were going across the sea into Capernaum. And, dark, already, had it become, and, not yet, had Jesus reached them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>moreover the sea, by reason of a great wind that blew, was rising high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having therefore rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they observe Jesus, walking upon the sea, and, near the boat, coming; and they were affrighted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, he, saith unto themIt is, I: be not affrighted!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They were willing, therefore, to receive him into the boat; and, straightway, the boat was at land, whither they had been slowly going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the morrow, the multitude that was standing on the other side of the sea, saw that there was not, another small-boat, there, save one,and that Jesus entered not, along with his disciples, unto the boat, but that, alone, his disciples departed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>howbeit there came boats out of Tiberias, near the place where they did eat the bread, after the Lord had given thanks:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When, therefore, the multitude saw, that, Jesus, was not there, nor yet his disciples, they themselves, got into the small boats, and came unto Capernaum, seeking Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and, finding him on the other side of the sea, they said unto himRabbi! when, camest thou, hither?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them, and saidVerily, verily, I say unto you: Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Be working, not for the food that perisheth, but for the food that endureth unto life age-abiding,which, the Son of Man, unto you, will give; for upon, the same, hath the Father, even God, set his seal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They said, therefore, unto himWhat are we to do, that we may be working the works of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered, and said unto themThis, is the work of God: that ye believe on him whom, he, hath sent forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They said, therefore, unto himWhat, then, art, thou, doing, by way of sign, that we may see, and believe in thee: what art thou working?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers, did eat, the manna, in the desert,just as it is written: Bread out of heaven, he gave them to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus said unto themVerily, verily, I say unto you: Not Moses, gave you the bread out of heaven; but, my Father, giveth you the real bread out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For, the bread of God, is that which is coming down out of heaven, and giving, life, unto the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said, therefore, unto himSir! Evermore, give us this bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said unto themI, am the bread of life: he that cometh unto me, in nowise shall hunger, and, he that believeth on me, in nowise shall thirst, any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I told youYe have even seen  me , and yet do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that which the Father is giving me, unto me, will have come, and, him that cometh unto me, in nowise will I cast out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Because I have come down from heaven,Not that I should be doing my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, this, is the will of him that sent me, That, of all that which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For, this, is the will of my Father, That, every one that vieweth the Son, and believeth on him, should have life age-abiding, and, I, should raise him up, at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews, therefore, began to murmur concerning him, because he saidI, am the bread that came down out of heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and were sayingIs not, this, Jesus, the son of Joseph,of whom, we, know the father and the mother! How is it then, that he, now, saith: Out of heaven, have I come down?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered, and said unto themBe not murmuring, one with another:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No one, can come unto me, except, the Father who sent me, draw him,and, I, will raise him up, in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophets,And they shall be, all, the instructed of God: Every one who hath heard of the Father, and learned, cometh unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that any one hath seen, the Father, save he who is from God,this one, hath seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you: He that believeth, hath life age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers, did eat, in the desert, the manna,and died:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This, is the bread which, out of heaven, cometh down, that one, thereof, may eat,and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I, am the living bread, which, out of heaven, came down: If one eat of this bread, he shall live unto times age-abiding; and, the bread, moreover, which, I, will give, is, my fleshfor the worlds life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews, therefore, began to strive one with another, sayingHow can this one, unto us, give his flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Jesus, therefore, said unto themVerily, verily, I say unto youExcept ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have not life within yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He that feedeth upon my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath life age-abiding, and, I, will raise him up at the last day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For, my flesh, is, true, food, and, my blood, is, true, drink:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He that feedeth upon my flesh, and drinketh my blood, in me, abideth, and, I, in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Just as the living Father sent me,and I live by reason of the Father, he also that feedeth upon me, even he, shall live by reason of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This, is the bread, which, out of heaven, came down:Not just as your fathers did eatand died! He that feedeth upon this bread, shall live unto times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>These things, said he, as, in a synagogue, he was teaching, in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many, of his disciples, therefore, when they heard, saidHard, is this discourse,Who can, thereunto, hearken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Jesus, knowing within himself that his disciples were murmuring concerning this, said unto themDoth, this, cause, you, to stumble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>then, if ye should view the Son of Man ascending where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The spirit, it is, that giveth life,the flesh, profiteth, nothing: The declarations which, I, have spoken unto you, are, spirit, and, are, life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some from among you, who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that did not believe, and who it was would deliver him up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>and he went on to sayFor this cause, have I said unto you: No one, can come unto me, except it have been given him, of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Because of this, many from among his disciples, went away back, and, no longer, with him, were walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Jesus, therefore, said unto the twelveAre, ye also, wishing to withdraw?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter answered himLord! unto whom, shall we go? Declarations o life age-abiding, thou hast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And, we, have believed, and come to know,that, thou, art the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered themDid not, I, make choice, of you, the twelve? And yet, from among you, one, is, an adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Now he was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot: for, the same, was about to deliver him up,one of the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
