If, these things, thou art doing, manifest thyself unto the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For, not even his brethren, were believing on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus, therefore, saith unto themMy season, not yet, is here; but, your season, at anytime, is ready:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you; but, me, it hateth, because, I, bear witness concerning it, that, the works thereof, are, wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ye, go up unto the feast: I, not yet, am coming up unto this feast, because, my season, not yet, hath fully come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, these things, having said unto them, he was still abiding in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, when his brethren had gone up unto the feast, then, he also, went up,not openly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews, therefore, were seeking him in the feast, and were sayingWhere is that one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and there was great, murmuring, about him among the multitudes: some, indeed, were sayingGood, is he!  but , others, were sayingNot so! but he is leading the multitude astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one, nevertheless, was speaking, openly, about him, because of their fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Presently, however, the feast being at its height, Jesus went up unto the temple and was teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews, therefore, began to marvel, sayingHow, doth this one know, letters, not having learned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus, therefore, answered them, and saidMy teaching, is not mine, but his who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any one intend, his will, to do, he shall get to know concerning the teachingwhether it is, of God, or, I, from myself, am speaking,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that, from himself, doth speak, his own glory, is seeking: he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same, is, true, and, injustice, in him, is there none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not, Moses, give you the law? And yet, not one of you, doeth the law!Why, seek ye, to slay, me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The multitude answeredA demon, thou hast: Who, is seeking, to slay, thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered, and said unto themOne work, I did, and ye, all, are marvelling:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For this cause, Moses, hath given you, circumcision,not that, of Moses, it is, but of the fathers;and, on Sabbath, ye circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If, circumcision, a man receiveth, on Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, with me, are ye bitter as gall, because, a whole man, I made, well, on Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Be not judging according to appearance, but, just judgment, be judging,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So then, some of them of Jerusalem were sayingIs not, this, he whom they are seeking to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And yet, see! with freedom of speech, he is talking, and, nothing, unto him, do they say:Have the rulers perhaps come to know, of a truth, that, this, is, the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, as for this one, we know whence he is; The Christ, however, whensoever he shall come, no one, getteth to know whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus, therefore, cried aloud in the temple, teaching, and sayingBoth me, ye know, and ye know whence I am,and yet, of myself, have I not come, but he is real, who sent me, whom, ye, know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I, know him, because, from him, I am, and, he, sent me forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were seeking therefore to seize him; and yet no one laid on him his hand, because, not yet, had come his hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But, from amongst the multitude, many, believed on him, and were sayingThe Christ, whensoever he cometh, greater signs, will he do, than those which, this one, did?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees hearkened unto the multitude murmuring concerning him these things; and the High-priests and the Pharisees sent forth officers, that they might seize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus, therefore, saidYet a little time, I am, with you, and withdraw unto him that sent me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye shall seek me, and not find me, and, where, I, am, ye, cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews, therefore, said unto themselvesWhither, is, this one, about to go, that we shall not find him? Unto the dispersion of the Greeks, is he about to go, and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What, is this which he said: Ye shall seek me and not find me, and, where, I, am, ye, cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now, on the lastthe greatday of the feast, Jesus was standing, and he cried aloud, sayingIf any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believeth on mejust as said the Scripture,River, from within him, shall flow, of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now, this, spake he concerning the Spirit which they who believed on him were about to receive; for, not yet, was there Spirit, because, Jesus, not yet, was glorified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Some from amongst the multitude, therefore, having hearkened unto these words, were sayingThis, is, in truth, the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others, were sayingThis, is, the Christ. But, others, were sayingOut of Galilee, is, the Christ, to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Hath not the Scripture said: Of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was, cometh the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>A division, therefore, arose in the multitude, because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Certain, indeed, from among them, were wishing to seize him; but, no one, thrust upon him his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So then the officers came unto the High-priests and Pharisees, and, they, said unto themFor what cause, have ye not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answeredNever, man spake thus!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees, therefore, answered themSurely, ye also, have not been led astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Surely, none of the rulers, hath believed in him, nor of the Pharisees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But, this multitude, that take no note of the law, are, laid under a curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus saith unto themhe that came unto him formerly, being, one, from among them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Surely, our law, doth not judge the man, unless it hear first from him, and get to know what he is doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said unto himSurely, thou also, art not, of Galilee? Search and see! That, out of Galilee, a prophet is not to arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>fehlt</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
