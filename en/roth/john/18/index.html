He saith unto themI, am he. Now Judas also, who was delivering him up, was standing with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When, therefore, he said unto them, I, am he, they went backwards, and fell to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Again, therefore, he questioned themWhom, seek ye? And, they, saidJesus, the Nazarene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answeredI told you, I, am he. If, then, ye seek me, let these go their way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that the word might be fulfilled which he had saidAs touching them whom thou hast given me, I lost from among them, not so much as one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Simon Peter, therefore, having a sword, drew it, and smote the High-priests servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus, therefore, said unto PeterThrust the sword into its sheath:The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I in anywise not drink it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The band, therefore, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, apprehended Jesus, and bound him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and led him unto Annas, first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the High-priest of that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel unto the Jews, that it was profitable for, one man, to die in behalf of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Simon Peter was following with Jesus, also another disciple. But, that disciple, was known unto the High-priest, and entered in, with Jesus, into the court of the High-priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>whereas, Peter, remained standing at the door outside. The other disciple, therefore, that was known of the High-priest, went out, and spake unto the portress, and brought in Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The female servant, therefore, the portress, saith unto PeterArt, thou also, from among the disciples of this man? He, saithI am not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the servants and the officers were standing by, having made, a coal fire, because it was cold,and were warming themselves; and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The High-priest, therefore, questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered himI, openly, have spoken, unto the world,I, ever, taught, in synagogue, and in the temple, where all the Jews gather together; and, in secret, spake nothing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why questionest thou me? question them who have heard, what I spake unto them. See! these, know what, I, said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, when, these things, he had said, one of the officers who was standing by, gave a smart blow to Jesus, sayingThus, answerest thou, the High-priest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered himIf, with abuse, I spake, bear witness of the abuse: but, if with respect, why, smitest thou me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Annas therefore sent him forth, bound, unto Caiaphas the High-priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said, therefore, unto himArt, thou also, from among his disciples? He, denied, and saidI am not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Saith one from among the servants of the High-priest, being, kinsman, of him whose ear Peter cut off,Did not, I, see thee, in the garden with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, therefore, Peter denied. And, straightway, a cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they lead Jesus from Caiaphas unto the judgment-hall. Now it was early; and, they themselves, entered not into the judgment-hall, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pilate, therefore, went forth outside unto them, and saith,What accusation bring ye against this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered and said unto himIf this one had not been doing, mischief, unto thee, had we not delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pilate, therefore, said unto themYe, take him, and, according to your law, judge ye him. The Jews said unto himUnto us, it is not allowed, to kill anyone!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that, the word of Jesus, might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying, by what manner of death, he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Pilate, therefore, entered again into the judgment-hall; and addressed Jesus, and said unto himArt, thou, the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answeredOf thyself, art, thou, this thing saying; or did, others, tell thee concerning me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answeredAm, I, a Jew? Thine own nation, and the High-priests, delivered thee up, unto me! What, hast thou done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answeredMy kingdom, is not of this world: If, of this world, had been my kingdom, mine own officers, would have been striving, that I should not be delivered up unto the Jews: but, now, my kingdom, is not from hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate, therefore, said unto himAnd yet, thou, art, not a king? Jesus answeredThou, sayest, that, a king, I am: I, for this, have been born, and, for this, have come into the world,that I may bear witness unto the truth: Every one who is of the truth, hearkeneth unto my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate saith unto himWhat, is truth? And, this saying, again, went he out to the Jews, and saith unto them,I, find in him, not a single fault.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Howbeit ye have, a custom, that, some one, I should release unto you, during the passover:Are ye minded, then, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they cried aloud again, sayingNot this man, but Barabbas! Now, Barabbas, was, a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
