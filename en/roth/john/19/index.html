O King of the Jews!and were giving unto him smart blows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate went forth again outside, and saith unto themSee! I lead him unto you outside, that ye may take knowledge, that, no single fault, do I find in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus, therefore, came forth outside, wearing the thorn crown, and the purple mantle. And he saith unto themLo! the Man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When, therefore, the High-priests and the officers saw him, they cried aloud, sayingCrucify! Crucify! Pilate saith unto themYe, take him, and crucify; for, I, find not in him, a fault.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered himWe, have, a law, and, according to the law, he ought to die, because, Son of God, himself, he made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When, therefore, Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and entered into the judgment-hail again, and saith unto JesusWhence, art, thou? But, Jesus, gave him no, answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pilate, therefore, saith unto himUnto me, dost thou not speak? Knowest thou not, that, authority, have I to release thee, and, authority, have I to crucify thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered himThou couldst have had no authority against me, at all, if it had not been given unto thee from above. Therefore, he that delivered me unto thee, hath, greater sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this cause, Pilate, began seeking to release him; but, the Jews, cried aloud sayingIf this man thou release, thou art not a friend of Caesar, for, every one who maketh himself king, speaketh against Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate, therefore, when he heard these words, led Jesus outside, and sat down upon a raised seat, in a place called Pavement, but, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the preparation of the passover,it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the JewsSee! your King!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They, therefore, cried aloudAway! away! Crucify him! Pilate saith unto themYour king, shall I crucify? The High-priests answeredWe have no king but Caesar!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then, therefore, he delivered him up unto them, that he might be crucified. They took possession, therefore, of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, bearing for himself the cross, he went forth unto the so-called Skull-place, which is named, in Hebrew, Golgotha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where, him, they crucified; and, with him, other two, on this side and on that, and, in the midst, Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate wrote a title also, and placed on the cross; and there was writtenJESUS, THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because, near, was the place to the city where Jesus was crucified; ad it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, in Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The High-priests of the Jews, therefore, were saying unto PilateDo not be writing, The King of the Jews; but that, he, said: King of the Jews, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answeredWhat I have written, I have written!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The soldiers, therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, unto each soldier, a part; also the tunic. Howbeit, the tunic was without seam, from above, woven throughout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They said, therefore, one to anotherLet us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose, it shall be;that, the Scripture, might be fulfilledThey parted my garments amongst them, and, for my vestment, they cast lots:yes verily, the soldiers, these things did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there were standing by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus, therefore, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved, saith unto his motherO woman, see! thy son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Afterwards, he saith unto the discipleSee! thy mother! And, from that hour, the disciple took her unto his own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus, knowing that, already, all things, have been finished,that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saithI thirst!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A vessel, was standing, full of vinegar. A sponge, therefore, full of the vinegar, put about, hyssop, brought they unto his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When, therefore, he had received the vinegar, Jesus saidIt is finished! And, bowing his head, delivered up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews, therefore, since it was, a preparation, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross during the Sabbath,for that Sabbath day was, great, requested Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The soldiers, therefore, came; and, of the first, indeed, brake the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but coming, unto Jesus, when they saw that, already, he was dead, they brake not his legs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but, one of the soldiers, with a spear, pierced, his side, and there came out, straightway, blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, he that hath seen, hath borne witness; and, genuine, is his testimony, and, he, knoweth that he saith, what is true, that, ye also, may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things came to pass, that, the Scripture, might be fulfilledA bone thereof, shall not be crushed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and, again, a different Scripture, saithThey shall look unto him whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But, after these things, Joseph from Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but having kept it secret for fear of the Jews, requested Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave permission. He came, therefore, and took away his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>There came, moreover, Nicodemus also,he that came unto him by night at the first,bearing a roll of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they received the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen-bandages with the spices,just as it is, a custom, with the Jews to prepare for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now there was, in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and, in the garden, an unused tomb, wherein, as yet, no one had been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So, there, by reason of the preparation of the Jews, because, near, was the tomb, laid they Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
