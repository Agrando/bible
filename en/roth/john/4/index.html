Jesus, therefore, having become toil-worn with the journey, was sitting thus, upon the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith unto herGive me to drink!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for, his disciples, had gone away into the city, that, food, they might buy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Samaritan woman, therefore, saith unto himHow dost, thou, being, a Jew, ask to drink, of me, who am, a Samaritan woman?  for, Jews, have no dealings with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered, and said unto herIf thou hadst known the free gift of God, and who it is that is saying unto thee, Give me to drink, thou, wouldst have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She saith unto himSir! not even a bucket, hast thou,and, the well, is, deep:Whence, then, hast thou the living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Art, thou, greater than, our father Jacob, who gave us the well,and, himself, out of it drank, and his sons, and his flocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered, and said unto herWhosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst, again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, whosoever shall drink of the water which, I, will give him, in nowise shall thirst, unto times age-abiding,but, the water which I will give him, shall become, within him, a fountain of water, springing up unto life age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman saith unto himSir! give me this water, that I thirst not, neither be coming hither to draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He saith unto herGo, call thy husband, and come hither!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered, and said  unto him I have no husband. Jesus saith unto herWell, saidst thou, A husband, I have not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for, five husbands, thou hast had,and, now, he whom thou hast, is not thy, husband: This true thing, hast thou spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman saith unto himSir! I perceive that, a prophet, art, thou:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers, in this mountain, worshipped; and, ye, say, that, in Jerusalem, is the place, where, to worship, it behoveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus saith unto herBelieve me, woman! There cometh an hour, when, neither in this mountain, nor yet in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye, worship, that which ye know not; We, worship, that which we know; because, salvation, is, of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But there cometh an hour, and, now, is,when, the real worshippers, shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for, even the Father, is seeking, such as these, as his worshippers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is, spirit; and, they that worship him, in spirit and truth, must needs worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman saith unto himI know that, Messiah, cometh, who is called Christ,Whensoever, he, shall come, he will tell us, everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus saith unto herI, that speak unto thee, am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, hereupon, came his disciples, and they began to marvel, that, with a woman, he was talking. No one, however, saidWhat seekest thou? orWhy talkest thou with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman, therefore, left her water-vessel, and went away into the city, and saith unto the men</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come! see a man, that told me all things that ever I did: Can, this, be, the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They came forth out of the city, and were coming unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the meantime, the disciples were requesting him, sayingRabbi! eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But, he, said unto themI, have, food, to eat, of which, ye, know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples, therefore, began to say, one to anotherHath anyone brought him, to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus saith unto themMy food, is, that I should do the will of him that sent me, and complete, his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Are, ye, not sayingYet, a fourmonth, it is, and, the harvest, cometh? Lo! I say unto youLift up your eyes, and gaze at the fields,that, white, are they unto, harvest. Already,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>he that reapeth, receiveth, a reward, and gathereth fruit unto life age-abiding; that, he that soweth, together may rejoice, with him that reapeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For, herein, doth the saying, hold good,One, is the sower, and, another, is the reaper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I, sent you forth, to be reaping that whereon, ye, have not toiled: Others, have toiled, and, ye, into their toil, have entered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, out of that city, many, believed on himof the Samaritans,by reason of the word of the woman in bearing witnessHe told me all things that ever I did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When, therefore, the Samaritans came unto him, they went on to request him to abide with them; and he abode there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, many more, believed by reason of his discourse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and, unto the woman, began to sayNo longer, by reason of thy talk, do we believe; for, we ourselves, have heard, and know that, This One, is, in truth, the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But, after the two days, he went forth from thence, into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For, Jesus himself, bare witness, that, a prophet, in his own fatherland, hath not, honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So, when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed him, having seen, all things, whatsoever he had done in Jerusalem during the feast; for, they also, went unto the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So he came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water, wine. And there was a certain courtier, whose son was sick, in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The same, hearing that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, came away unto him, and began requesting him, that he would come down and heal his son; for he was on the point of dying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus therefore said unto himExcept, signs and wonders, ye see, in nowise will ye believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The courtier saith unto himSir! come down, ere my child die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus saith unto himBe going thy way: thy son, liveth! And the man believed in the word which Jesus spake to him, and at once went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, when he was even now going down, his servants, met him, saying, that, his boy, was living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>So he enquired the hour, from them, when he began, to amend. They said, therefore, unto himYesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father took note that it was, in that hour, wherein Jesus said unto himThy son, liveth! and he believed, he, and all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now, this again, as, a second sign, Jesus did, after coming out of Judaea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
