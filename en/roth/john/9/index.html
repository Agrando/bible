He went away, therefore, and washed, and came, seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbours, therefore, and they who used to observe him aforetimethat he was, a beggar, were sayingIs not, this, he that used to sit and beg?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Others, were sayingTis, the same. Others, were sayingNay! but he is, like him. He, was sayingI, am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they were saying unto himHow  then  were thine eyes opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He, answeredThe man that is called Jesus, made, clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me: Withdraw unto the pool of Siloam, and wash. Going away, therefore, and washing, I received sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said unto himWhere is, He? He saithI know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They bring him unto the Phariseeshim at one time blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was Sabbath, on the day when Jesus made, the clay, and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Again, therefore, the Pharisees also questioned him, as to how he received sight. And, he, said unto themClay, laid he upon mine eyes, and I washed,and do see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Certain from among the Pharisees, therefore, were sayingThis man is not, from God, because, the Sabbath, he keepeth not. Others,  however  were sayingHow can a sinful man, such signs as these, be doing? And there was, a division, among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they were saying unto the blind man, again, What dost, thou, say concerning him, in that he opened thine eyes? And, he, saidA prophet, is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews, therefore, did not believe, concerning him, that he was blind, and received sight,until they called the parents of him that had received sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and questioned them, sayingIs, this, your son, of whom, ye, say, that blind, he was, born? How, then, seeth he, even now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents, therefore, answered, and saidWe know that, this, is our son, and that, blind, he was born;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, how he now seeth, we know not, or, who opened his eyes, we, know not,Question, him, he is, of age, he, concerning himself, shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things, said his parents, because they were in fear of the Jews,for, already, had the Jews agreed together, that, if anyone should confess, him, to be Christ, an, excommunicant from the synagogue, should he be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For this cause, his parents saidHe is, of age,question him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they called the man a second time  who had been blind, and said unto himGive glory unto God! We know that, this man, is, a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He, therefore, answeredWhether he is a sinner, I know not: One thing, I know,That, whereas I was, blind, now, I see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said, therefore, unto himWhat did he unto thee? How opened he thine eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered themI told you just now, and ye did not hear: Why, again, do ye wish to hear? Are, ye also, wishing to become, his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they reviled him, and saidThou, art, the disciple, of that man; but, we, are, Moses, disciples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We, know, that, unto Moses, hath God spoken; but, as for this man, we know not whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered, and said unto themWhy! Herein, is, the marvel: That, ye, know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that, God, unto sinners, doth not hearken: but, if one be, a worshipper of God, and be doing, his will, unto this one, he hearkeneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Out of age-past time, hath it never been heard, that anyone opened the eyes of one who, blind, had been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he could have done nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said unto himIn sins, wast, thou, born, altogether; and art, thou, teaching, us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and, finding him, saidDost, thou, believe on the son of Man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered  and said And, who, is he, Sir, that I may believe on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said unto himThou hast both seen him and, he that is speaking with thee, is, he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, he, saidI believe, Sir! and worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus saidFor judgment, I, unto this world, came: that, they who were not seeing, might see, and, they who were seeing, might become, blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They of the Pharisees who were with him, heard, these things, and said unto himAre, we also, blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said unto themIf, blind, ye had been, ye had not had sin; but, now, ye say, We see, your sin, abideth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
