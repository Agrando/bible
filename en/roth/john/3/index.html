Can he, into the womb of his mother, a second time, enter, and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answeredVerily, verily, I say unto thee: Except one be born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which hath been born of the flesh, is, flesh, and, that which hath been born of the spirit, is, spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not marvel, that I said unto thee: Ye must needs be born from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The spirit, where it pleaseth, doth breathe, and, the sound thereof, thou hearest; but knowest not, whence it cometh and whither it goeth: Thus, is every one who hath been born of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered, and said unto himHow, can these things, come about?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered, and said unto himArt, thou, the teacher of Israel, and, these things, knowest not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily, verily, I say unto thee: What we know, we speak, and, of what we have seen, we bear witness, and, our witness, ye receive not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If, the earthly things, I told you, and ye believe not, How, if I should tell you the heavenly things, will ye believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, no one, hath ascended into heaven, save he that, out of heaven, descended,The Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, just as, Moses, lifted up the serpent in the desert, so, must, the Son of Man, be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That, whosoever believeth in him, may have life age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God, so loved, the world, that, his Only Begotten Son, he gave,that, whosoever believeth on him, might not perish, but have life age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God, sent not, his Son into the world, that he might judge the world, but, that the world might be saved through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that believeth on him, is not to be judged: he that believeth not, already, hath been judged,because he hath not believed on the name of the Only Begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, this, is the judgment: That, the light, hath come into the world,and men loved, rather the darkness than the light, for, wicked, were their, works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, whosoever doth practise corrupt things, hateth the light, and cometh not unto the light, lest his works should be reproved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, he that doeth the truth, cometh unto the light, that his works may be, made manifest, that, in God, have they been wrought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things, came Jesus, and his disciples, into the Judaean land; and, there, was he tarrying with them, and immersing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And John also was immersing in Aenon, near to him, because, many waters, were there; and they were coming, and being immersed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for, not yet, had John been cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There arose, therefore, a questioning, from among the disciples of John, with a Jew,concerning purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came unto John, and said unto himRabbi! he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, unto whom, thou, hast borne witness, see! the same, is immersing; and, all, are coming unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered, and saidA man can receive, nothing, except it have been given him out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye yourselves, unto me, bear witness, that, I, saidI, am not the Christ; butI am sent before, That One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that hath the bride, is, bridegroom; but, the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth by and hearkeneth unto him, greatly, rejoiceth, by reason of the voice of the bridegroom. This, my joy, therefore, is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That One, it behoveth to increase,but, me, to decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He that, from above, doth come, over all, is: he that is of the earth, of the earth, is, and, of the earth, doth speak: he that, out of heaven, doth come, over all, is,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What he hath seen and heard, of, the same, he beareth witness,and, his witness, no one, receiveth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He that hath received his witness, hath set sealthat, God, is, true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For, he whom God hath sent, the sayings of God, doth speak; for, not by measure, giveth he the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father, loveth the Son, and, all things, hath given into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He that believeth on the Son, hath life age-abiding: whereas, he that yieldeth not unto the Son, shall not see life,but, the anger of God, awaiteth him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
