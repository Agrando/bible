He saith unto himLord, dost, thou, wash my feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered, and said unto himWhat, I, am doing, thou, knowest not, as yet; howbeit, thou shalt got to know, hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter saith unto himIn nowise shalt thou, ever, wash my feet. Jesus answered himIf I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter saith unto himLord! not my feet only, but my hands also, and my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus saith unto himHe that hath bathed himself, hath no need  save as to the feet  to get washed; but is pure, as a whole. And, ye, are, pure, but not ye, all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he know the man that was delivering him up; therefore, said heNot ye all, are pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When, therefore, he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and reclined, again said he unto themAre ye taking note, what I have done unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye, call me, The Teacher, and, The Lord,and, well, say, for I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If then, I, have washed your feet,  The Lord, and, The Teacher, ye also, ought to wash, one anothers, feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, an example, have I given you,that, just as, I, did unto you, ye also, should be doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Verily, verily, I say unto youA servant is not greater than his lord, neither one sent forth greater than he that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If, these things, ye know, happy, are ye, if ye be doing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Not, concerning you all, am I speaking,for, I, know of whom I made choice; butthat, the Scripture, might be fulfilled: He that feedeth on my bread, hath lifted up against me, his heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Henceforth, I tell you, before it cometh to pass,that ye may believe, whensoever it doth come to pass, that, I, am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily, I say unto youHe that receiveth whomsoever I shall send, receiveth, me; and, he that receiveth, me, receiveth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These things, having said, Jesus, was troubled in spirit, and bare witness, and saidVerily, verily, I say unto youOne from among you, will deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples began to look one at another, being at a loss concerning whom he was speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One of Jesus disciples was reclining in his bosom, one whom Jesus loved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>so Simon Peter beckoneth unto the same, and saith unto himSay, Who is it? concerning whom he speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He, falling back thus, upon the breast of Jesus, saith unto himLord! who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus, therefore, answerethThat one, it is, for whom, I, shall dip the morsel, and give unto him. So, dipping the morsel, he taketh and giveth it unto Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, after the morsel, then, entered, Satan, into that man. Jesus, therefore, saith unto himWhat thou art doing, do quickly!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, as to this, none of them who were reclining with him knew respecting what, he said it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, some, were thinking, since Judas held the bag, that Jesus was saying to himBuy the things of which we have, need, for the feast; or that, unto the destitute, he should give something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So, he, taking the morsel, went out straightway;and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When, therefore, he had gone out, Jesus saithJust now, was, the Son of Man, glorified, and, God, was glorified in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, God, will glorify him, in himself,and, straightway, glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Dear children! Yet a little, am I, with you. Ye shall seek me, and, just as I said unto the Jews, Whither, I, go, ye, cannot come, unto you also, I say it, even now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment, give I unto you,That ye be loving one another: Just as I loved you, that, ye also, be loving one another:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this, shall all men take knowledge, that, my disciples, ye are,If ye have, love, one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter saith unto himLord! whither dost thou withdraw? Jesus answeredWhither I withdraw, thou canst not, now, follow me, but thou shalt follow, hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter saith unto himLord! why, cannot I follow thee, even now? My life, in thy behalf, will I lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answerethThy life, in my behalf, wilt thou lay down? Verily, verily, I say unto theeIn nowise shall a cock crow till thou hast denied me, thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
