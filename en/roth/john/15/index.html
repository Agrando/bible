Just as, the branch, cannot be bearing fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, so, neither, ye, except, in me, ye abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I, am the vine: Ye, are the branches. He that abideth in me and, I, in him, the same, beareth much fruit; because, apart from me, ye can bring forth, nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If one abide not me, he is cast out as the branch, and withered, and they gather them,and, into fire, they cast them, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If ye abide in me, and, my sayings, in you, abide, whatsoever ye may be desiring, ask! and it shall be brought to pass for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Herein, was my Father glorified, that, much fruit, ye should bear, and become my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Just as the Father loved me, I also, loved you: Abide ye in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If, my commandments, ye keep, ye shall abide in my love,just as, I, the Fathers commandments, have kept, and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things, have I spoken unto you, that, my own joy, in you, may be, and, your joy, may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This, is my own commandment, That ye be loving one another, just as I loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love than this, hath, no one, That, his life, one should lay down in behalf of his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye, are, friends of mine, if ye be doing that which, I, am commanding you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No longer, do I call you, servants, for, the servant, knoweth not what, his lord, is doing. But, you, I have called, friends, because, all things which I heard from my Father, made I known unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Not, ye, chose, me, but, I, chose you, and placed you, that ye should go your way and bear, fruit,and, your fruit, should abide: that, whatsoever ye should ask the Father in my name, he might give unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things, I command you, That ye be loving one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If, the world, is hating, you, ye are getting to know that, me, before you, it hath hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If, of the world, ye had been, the world, of its own, had been fond; but, because, of the world, ye are not, on the contrary, I, chose you out of the world, therefore, the world, doth hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word which, I, spake unto you: A servant is not greater than his lord. If, me, they persecuted, you too, will they persecute,If, my word, they kept, your own also, will they keep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, all these things, will they do unto you, on account of my name, because they know not him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Had I not come and spoken unto them, Sin, had they none; but, now, have they no, excuse, for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that hateth me, hateth, my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Had I not done among them, the works, which, no other, had done, sin, had they none; but, now, have they, both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Butthat the word which, in their law, is written, might be fulfilledThey hated me without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Whensoever the Advocate shall come, Whom, I, will send unto you from the Father, The Spirit of truth, which, from the Father, cometh forth, He, will bear witness concerning me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And do, ye also, bear witness, because, from the beginning, ye are, with me,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
