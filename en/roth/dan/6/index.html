The king answered and said, Certain is the thingaccording to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be abolished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then answered they and were saying before the king, Daniel, who is of the sons of the exile of Judah, hath made thee, O king, of none account, also the interdict which thou hast signed,but, three times a day, is asking his petition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then, the king, when he heard, the matter, was sorely displeased with himself, and, upon Daniel, set his heart, to deliver him,and, until the going in of the sun, was striving to rescue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then, these men, crowded unto the king,and were saying to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that, no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth, may be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then, the king, gave word, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions.
