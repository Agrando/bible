so should ye bring me under the penalty of mine own head unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Daniel, unto the overseer whom the ruler of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I pray theeprove thy servants, ten days,and let them give us vegetable food, that we may eat, and water that we may drink:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the youths who have been eating the delicacies of the king,and, as thou shalt see, deal thou with thy servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So then he hearkened unto them, according to this word,and proved them ten-days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and, at the end of ten days, their countenances appeared more comely, and fatter in flesh,than any of the youths who had been eating the delicacies of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus it came about that the overseer continued taking away their delicacies, and the wine appointed them to drink,and kept on giving them vegetable food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, as for these four youths, God, gave them, knowledge and skill, in all learning and wisdom,and, Daniel, had discernment, in all visions and dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now, at the end of the days after which the king had given word to bring them in, then did the ruler of the eunuchs bring them in, before Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then the king, spake with them, and there was not found, from among them all, one like unto Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,therefore stood they before the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and, in any matter of wisdom and discernment as to which the king, enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the sacred scribesthe magicians, who were in all his realm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now Daniel continued, until the first year of Cyrus the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
