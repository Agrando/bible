And, when he had spoken with me this word, I stood up trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he unto me, Do not fear, Daniel, for, from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard; and, I, am come, by reason of thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But, the ruler of the kingdom of Persia, withstood me twenty-one days, but lo! Michael, one of the chief rulers, came in to help me,and, I, left him there, beside the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So then I am come to let thee understand that which shall befall thy people in the afterpart of the days,for yet is the vision for   days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, when he had spoken with me such words as these,I set my face towards the earth, and was dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then lo! like the similitude of the sons of men, one was touching my lips,so I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him who was standing before me, O my lord! By the revelation, my pains have seized me, and I retain no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How then can the servant of this my lord speak with this my lord,seeing that, as for mehenceforth, there remaineth in me no strength, and no, spirit, is left in me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then again there touched me one like in appearance to a son of earth, and he strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, Do not fear, O man greatly delighted in! peace to thee, be strong, yea be strong! And, as he spake with me, I gained strength, and said, Let my lord speak, for thou hast strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? But, now, must I return to fight with the ruler of Persia; I, therefore am going forth, and lo! the ruler of Greece, is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Howbeit I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth,but there is no one who holdeth strongly with me concerning these things, save Michael your ruler.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
