Thou, therefore, O Belteshazzar, the interpretation, do thou tell, forasmuch as, all the wise men of my kingdom, are unable, the interpretation, to make known to me, but, thou, art able, because, the spirit of the holy gods, is in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for about one moment, and, his thoughts, troubled him. The king spake and said, O Belteshazzar, let neither, the dream, nor the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My Lord, The dream, be for them who hate thee, and, the interpretation, for them who are thy foes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree which thou sawest, which grew and became strong, whose, height, reached unto the heavens, and, the view, thereof to all the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whose, foliage, was beautiful, and whose, fruit, abundant, and, food for all, was in it,under it, dwelt the wild beasts of the field, and, in the branches thereof, nestled the birds of the heavens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thyself, it is, O king, in that thou art grown, and become strong,and, thy greatness hath grown, and reached to the heavens, and, thy dominion, to the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, whereas the king saw a watcher and holy one coming down out of the heavens, who said, Hew ye down the tree and despoil it, nevertheless, the stock of its rootsin the earth, leave ye, even in a bond of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field,and, with the dew of the heavens, let it he drenched, and, along with the wild beasts of the field, be its portion, until that, seven seasons, pass over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This, is the interpretation, O king,and, the decree of the Most High, it is, which hath come upon my lord the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That, thee, are they going to drive forth from among men, and, along with the wild beasts of the field, shall be thy dwelling, and, grasslike oxen, will they suffer, thee, to eat, and, with the dew of the heavens, will they suffer, thee, to be drenched, and, seven seasons, shall pass over thee,until that thou come to know, that the Most High, hath dominion, over the kingdom of men, and, to whomsoever he pleaesth, he giveth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, whereas they gave word to leave the stock of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom, unto thee, is sure,after that thou come to know, that the heavens, have dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore, O king, let, my counsel, be pleasing unto thee, thy sin, then,by righteousness, break thou off, and, thine iniquities, by shewing favour to the oppressed,if so be it may become the lengthening out of thy security.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this, came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months, over the palace of the kingdom of Babylon, was he walking:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the king spake and said, Is not, this, Babylon the great,which, I myself, have built as the home of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the dignity of my majesty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>While yet the word was in the mouth of the king, a voice, out of the heavens, fell,Unto thee, is it said, O Nebuchadnezzar the king, The kingdom, hath departed from thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, from among men, are they going to drive, thee, forth, and, with the wild beast of the field, shall be thy dwelling, grasslike oxen, will they suffer, thee, to eat, and, seven seasons, shall pass over thee,until that thou come to know that the Most High, hath dominion, over the kingdom of men, and, to whomsoever he pleaseth, he giveth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Immediately, the word, was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and, from among men, was he driven forth, and, grasslike oxen, did he eat, and, with the dew of the heavens, his body was drenched,until that, his hair, like to eagles feathers, was grown, and his nails, like birds claws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, mine eyes unto the heavens, did uplift, and, mine understanding, unto me, returned, and, the Most High, I blessed, and, to him that liveth age-abidingly, I rendered praise and honour,whose dominion, is an age-abiding dominion, and, his kingdom, lasteth from generation to generation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, all the inhabitants of the earth, as nothing, are accounted, and, according to his own pleasure, dealeth hewith the army of the heavens, and the inhabitants of the earth,and none there is who can smite upon his hand, or say to him, What hast thou done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>At the same time, mine understanding, returned unto me, and, for the dignity of my kingdom, my majesty and my brightness, returned unto me, and, unto me, my nearest friends and my nobles, did seek,and, over my kingdom, was I restored, and, surpassing greatness, was added unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now, I, Nebuchadnezzar, am praising and extolling and honouring the King of the Heavens, all whose works, are truth, and, his ways, right; and, them who walk in pride, he is able to abase,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
