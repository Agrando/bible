Then stepped forth Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, out of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Andbeing gathered togetherthe satraps, the nobles, and the pashas and near friends of the king, saw these men, over whose bodies the fire had, no power, nor was, a hair of their head, singed, neither were, their trousers, disfigured,nor had, the smell of fire, come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his messenger, and delivered his servants, who trusted in him,when, the word of the king, they transgressed, and delivered up their bodies, that they might not serve nor adore any god, saving their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore do I make a decree, that, whosoever of any people, race, or tongue it be that shall charge any error upon the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and, his house, into a dunghill, shall be changed; because there is no other God, who is able to deliver, like this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then, the king, advanced Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
