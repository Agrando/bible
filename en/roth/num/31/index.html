But whatsoever cannot go into fire, ye shall pass through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and be clean,and after-wards, shall ye come into the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Reckon thou up the sum of the booty that was captured, both of man and of beat,thou and Eleazar the priest, and the ancestral heads of the assembly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and divide the booty into two parts, between them who took upon them the war, who went out in the host,and all the   assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then shalt thou levy a tribute unto Yahwehfrom the men of war, who went forth in the host, one living thing, out of five hundred,of the human beings, and of the herd, and of the asses and of the flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>out of their half, shall ye take   unto Eleazar the priest as a heave-offering unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And out of the half allotted to the sons of Israel, shalt thou take one allotted portion out of fifty of the human beings, of the herd, of the asses and of the flock of all b the cattle,and shalt give them unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the habitation of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses and Eleazar the priest did,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass that the booty, over and above the prey which the people of the host had seized, was,of the flock, six hundred and seventy-five thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and, of the herd, seventy-two thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and, of the asses, sixty-one thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and, of the human persons, even of the woman-kind who had not cohabited with man,all the per-sons, thirty-two thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the half, the share of them who had gone forth in the host, was,the number of the flockthree hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and so, the tribute unto Yahweh, out of the flock, wassix hundred and seventy-five;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the herd, thirty-six thousand,and the tribute of them unto Yahwehseventy-two;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the asses, thirty thousand and five hundred,and the tribute of them unto Yahweh, sixty-one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and the human persons, sixteen thousand,and the tribute of them unto Yahweh, thirty-two persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Moses gave the tributethe heave-offering of Yahweh, unto Eleazar the priest,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, of the half, allotted unto the sons of Israel,which Moses halved away from the men who had gone out in the host,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>the half allotted unto the assembly, wasof the flock, three hundred and thirty-seven thousand, and five hundred;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and, of the herd, six and thirty thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and, of asses, thirty thousand and five hundred;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and, human persons, sixteen thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So then Moses tookout of the half belonging to the sons of Israel the allotted portion one out of fifty, of the human beings and of the beasts,and gave them unto the Levites, the keepers of the charge of the habitation of Yahweh, As Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then came near unto Moses the officers who belonged unto the thousands of the host,the princes of thousands and the princes of hundreds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and said unto Moses, Thy servants have reckoned up the sum of the men of war who are in our hand,and there is not missed from among us, a man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore have we brought near an offering unto Yahweh, what, each man, hath foundarticles of gold, ankle chains and bracelets, rings earrings and buckles,to put a propitiatory-covering over our souls before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So Moses, and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,all the wrought articles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all the gold of the heave-offering which they offered up unto Yahweh, wassixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels,of the princes of thousands, and of the princes of hundreds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The men of the host, had taken prey, each man for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So then Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the princes of thousands, and hundreds,and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the sons of Israel before Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
