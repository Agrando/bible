With us also, hath he not spoken? And Yahweh heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now, the man Moses, was patient, exceedingly,above all the sons of earth, who were on the face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said Yahweh suddenly, unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent,and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both went forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then said he Hear, I beseech you my words. When ye have your prophet, As Yahweh in a vision, will I make myself known, unto him; In a dream, will I speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Not so, my servant Moses,In all my house, trusty, is he:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Mouth to mouth, do I speak with him And plainlynot in dark sayings, And the form of Yahweh, doth he discern,Wherefore then, were ye not afraid to speak against my servantagainst Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the anger of Yahweh kindled upon theme and he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, when, the cloud, removed from off the tent,lo! Miriam, leprous, like snow! And Aaron turned unto Miriam and lo! leprous!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Aaron unto Moses,Oh my lord, do not I beseech thee lay upon us sin, although we have made ourselves foolish, and although we have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let her not, I beseech thee, remain like the still-born,which when it is born of its mother, the half of its flesh is consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Moses made outcry unto Yahweh, saying,O GOD, I beseech thee grant healing. I beseech thee unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yahweh said unto Moses: If, her own father, had, but spat, in her face, would she not, have acknowledged the shame for seven days? Let her shut herself up for seven days, outside the camp, and afterwards, let her be received back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Miriam shut herself up, outside the camp, for seven days,and, the people, set not forward, until Miriam had been received back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then afterwards, did the people set forward from Hazeroth, and encamped in the desert of Paran.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
