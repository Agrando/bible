And when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, lo! the place, was a place for cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came in,and spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of assembly, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As touching Atroth and Dibon, and Jazer and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh,and Sebam and Nebo, and Beon-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>the land which Yahweh smote before the assembly of Israel, a land for cattle, it is,and, thy servants, have cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they saidIf we have found favour in thine eyes, let this land he given unto thy servants, for a possession,do not take us over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then said Moses unto the sons of Gad and unto the sons of Reuben,Shall, your brethren, go into the war, and ye, settle down here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore, then, should ye dissuade the heart of the sons of Israel, from passing over into the land which Yahweh hath given to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus, did your fathers,when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea, to view the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and they went up as far as the ravine of Eschol, and viewed the land, and then dissuaded the heart of the sons of Israel from entering into the land, which Yahweh had given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then was the anger of Yahweh kindled on that day,and he aware, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt from twenty years old and upwards, shall see the soil, which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac and unto Jacob, because they have not followed after me fully;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>save Caleb son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, and Joshua, son of Nun,for they followed after Yahweh, fully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the anger of Yahweh kindled upon Israel, and he made them wander in the desert, forty years,until all the generation who had done the evil in the eyes of Yahweh, had wasted away!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Lo! therefore, ye have arisen in the room of your fathers, brood of sinful men,to heap up yet more upon the heat of the anger of Yahweh, towards Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If ye do turn away from following him, then will he yet again leave them behind in the desert,so shall ye bring destruction upon all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then came they near unto him, and said, Folds, for flocks, would we build for our cattle, here,and cities for our little ones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but, we, would arm ourselves promptly, before the sons of Israel, until that we have brought them into their place,so should our little ones remain in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We would not return unto our houses,until the sons of Israel have possessed themselves each man, of his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For we would not inherit with them, over the Jordan, and onwards,because our inheritance hath come unto us on this side the Jordan towards sunrise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses said unto them, If ye will indeed do this thing,if ye will arm yourselves, before Yahweh, for the war;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and every armed man of you pass over the Jordan before Yahweh,until he hath dispossessed his enemies, from before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the land be subdued before Yahweh then afterwards, shall ye return, and shall be acquitted by Yahweh and by Israel,and this land shall be yours for a possession before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, if ye shall not do this, lo! ye will have sinned against Yahweh,and take note of your sin, that it will find you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your flocks,and then that which hath gone forth from your mouth, ye shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then spake the sons of Gad, and the sons of Reuben unto Moses, saying,thy servants, will do, as, my lord, is giving command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our little ones, our wives, our cattle, and all our beasts, shall remain there in the cities of Gilead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and thy servants, will pass over every one armed for war, before Yahweh to battle,as, my lord is speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Moses gave command concerning them, unto Eleazar the priest and unto Joshua son of Nun, and unto the headset the fathers of the tribes, of the sons of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and Moses said unto themIf the sons of Gad and the son of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every one armed for the war before Yahweh, and the land be subdued before you, then shall ye give unto them the land of Gilead, for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, if they will not pass over armed, with you, then shall they accept a possession in your midst, in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then responded the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, saying,That which Yahweh had spoken unto thy servants, so, will we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We, will pass over armed, before Yahweh into the land of Canaan,then shall be ours, the possession of our inheritance across the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then Moses gave unto them even unto the sons of Gad and unto the sons of Reuben and unto the half tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land by her cities with boundaries, even the cities of the land round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth,and Aroer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and Atroth-shophan and Jazer, and Jogbehah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran,fortified cities and folds for flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh,and Kiriathaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and Nebo and Baal-meontheir names being changed, and Sibmah,and they gave names to the cities which they built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then went the sons of Machir son of Manasseh to Gilead, and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Moses gave Gilead unto Machir son of Manasseh, and he dwelt therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jair, son of Manasseh, went, and captured their encampments,and called them Havvoth-jair. \fs15</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, Nobah, went, and captured Kenath, with the villages thereof,and called it Nobah, after his own name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
