And who is he that can stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers alkali;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore will he sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and will purify the sons of Levi, and will smelt them, as gold and as silver; so shall they belong to Yahweh, offering a gift in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then shall the gift of Judah and Jerusalem, be pleasant to Yahweh,as in the days of age-past times, and as in the ancient years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore will I draw near unto you for judgment, and will become a swift witness against the mutterers of incantations, and against the adulterers, and against them that swear to a falsehood,and against them who rob the hire of the hireling, the widow and the fatherless, and that drive away the sojourner, and do not revere me, saith Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Because, I, Yahweh, have not changed, therefore, ye, the sons of Jacob, have not been utterly consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>From the days of your fathers, have ye departed from my statutes, and not observed them, Return ye unto me, that I may return unto you, saith Yahweh of hosts.
