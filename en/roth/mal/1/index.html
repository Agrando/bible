Is not Esau, brother, to Jacob? enquireth Yahweh, Yet have I loved Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And, Esau, have I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and his inheritance   for the jackals of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whereas Edom, may say, We are laid waste, but we will again build the desolate places, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, They, may build, but, I, will pull down, and men shall call them, The Boundary of Lawlessness, and, The people with whom Yahweh hath indignation unto times age-abiding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, your own eyes, shall see,and, ye yourselves, shall say, Yahweh, be magnified, beyond the boundary of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son, will honour a father, and, a servant, his lord, If then, a father, I am, where is mine honour? And, if, a lord, I am, where is my reverence? saith Yahweh of hosts to you, ye priests, who despise my Name, and yet say, Wherein have we despised thy Name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In bringing near upon mine altar, polluted food, while yet ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? Because ye say, As for the table of Yahweh, a thing to be despised, it is;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when ye bring near the blind as a sacrifice,   No harm! Offer it, I pray you, unto thy pasha, Will he accept thee? or lift up thy countenance? saith Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, therefore, pacify, I pray you, the face of GOD, that he may grant us favour,at your hands, hath this come to pass, Will he lift up the countenances, of any of you? saith Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is there, even among you, that will shut the doors, so as not to set light to mine altar, for nothing? I can take no pleasure in you, saith Yahweh of hosts, and, your present, can I not accept at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, from the rising of the sun, even unto the going in thereof, great is my Name among the nations, and, in every place, incense, is offered to my Name, and a pure present,for great is my Name among the nations, saith Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But ye are profaning me, in that ye say, As for the table of the Lord, polluted it is, and, as for his produce, contemptible is his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye have said, Lo! what a weariness! And ye have snuffed at Me, saith Yahweh of hosts, and have brought in the torn and the lame and the sick, thus have ye brought the present, Could I accept it at your hand? saith Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But accursed is he that defraudeth, who, when there is in his flock a male, yet voweth and sacrificeth a corrupt thing to the Lord, for, a great king, am I, saith Yahweh of hosts, and, my Name, is revered among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
