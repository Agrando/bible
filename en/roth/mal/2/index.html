Did not, one GOD, create us? Wherefore should we deal treacherously one with another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Judah, hath dealt treacherously, and, an abomination, hath been wrought in Israel, and in Jerusalem, for Judah, had profaned, the holy place of Yahweh, which he had loved, and hath taken to himself the daughter of a foreign GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May Yahweh, cut off, from the man that doeth ithim that crieth out and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, him also that bringeth near a present to Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, this, a second time, will ye do, covering with tears, the altar of Yahweh, weeping and making outcry,because he will not again turn unto the gift, and receive   with acceptance, at your hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet ye say, For what cause? Because, Yahweh, hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, with whom, thou, hast dealt treacherously, though, she, was thy consort, and thy covenant wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now was it not, One,   who had, the residue of the spirit? What, then, of that One? He was seeking a godly seed. Therefore should ye take heed to your spirit, and, with the wife of thy youth, do not thou deal treacherously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he hateth divorce, saith Yahweh, God of Israel, him also who covereth with violence his own clothing, saith Yahweh of hosts,therefore should ye take heed to your spirit, and not deal treacherously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye have wearied Yahweh with your words, and yet ye say, Wherein have we been wearisome? When ye have said, Everyone who doeth wrong, is right in the eyes of Yahweh, and, in them, he hath taken delight, or, Where is the God of justice?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
