are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to solemnise with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab,besides the covenant, which he solemnised with them in Horeb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them,Ye yourselves, saw all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, unto Pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>the great provings which thine own eyes saw,those great signs and wonders:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>yet hath Yahweh not given onto you a heart to know, or eyes to see or ears to hear,until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I led you, therefore forty years in the desert,your mantles fell not with age, from off you, even thy sandal, fell not with age from off thy foot:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Bread, ye did not eat, and wine and strong drink, ye did not drink,that ye might know that, I, Yahweh, was your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when ye entered into this place, then came forth Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan to meet us in battle and we smote them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites,and unto the half tribe of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ye must, therefore, keep the words of this covenant, and do them,that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ye are stationed, to-day, all of you, before Yahweh your God,your heads your tribes, and your elders and your officers, every man of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>your little ones your wives, and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps,from him that heweth thy wood unto him that draweth thy water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that thou mayest pass through into the covenant of Yahweh thy God and into his oath,which Yahweh thy God is solemnising with thee, to-day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>that he may confirm thee to-day as his own people, while, he, becometh thine own God, as he spake unto thee,and as he sware unto thy fathers, unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And not with you alone, am I solemnising this covenant and this oath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but with him who is here with us, standing to-day before Yahweh our God,and with him who is not here with us to-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(For, ye, know, how we dwelt in the land of Egypt,and how we passed through the midst of the nations which ye did pass through;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and ye saw their disgusting images, and their manufactured gods,the wood and the stone, the silver and the gold that are with them.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lest there be among youa man or a woman or a family or a tribe, whose heart is turning to-day, from Yahweh our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations,lest there be among you a root fruitful of poison and wormwood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and so it come to pass while he is hearing the words of this oath, that he will bless himself in his heartsaying, Prosperity, shall I have, although in the stubbornness of my heart, I go on,so that the drunkenness addeth to the thirst:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yahweh will not be willing to forgive him, but, then, will the anger of Yahweh and his jealousy smoke against that man, and all the oath that is written in this scroll, shall settle down upon him,and Yahweh wipe out his name from under the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and Yahweh single him out for calamity, out of all the tribes of Israel,according to all the oaths of the covenant that is written in this scroll of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that the generation coming afteryour sons who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come in from a far-off land, will saywhen they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses thereof wherewith Yahweh hath made it sick:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>brimstone and salt burning up all the land thereof, it shall not be sown neither shall it shoot forth neither shall there come up thereon any herbage,like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrow in his anger and in his wrath:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>yea all the nations will say, For what cause, hath Yahweh done, thus, unto this land? what meaneth this great heat of anger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then will men say, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh the God of their fathers,which he solemnised with them, when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and went and served other gods, and bowed down to them,gods which they had not known, and in which he had given them no share:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>therefore did the anger of Yahweh kindle upon that land,to bring in upon it all the curse that is written in this scroll;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and therefore hath Yahweh rooted them out, from off their own soil, in anger and in wrath and in great indignation,and cast them into another land as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The secret things,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
