And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye foolishly went up towards the hill-country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then said Yahweh unto meSay unto them Ye shall not go up, nor fight, for I am not in your midst,lest ye should be smitten before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So I spake unto you howbeit ye hearkened not,but rebelled against the bidding of Yahweh, and presumptuously went up the hill-country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then came forth the Amorites who were dwelling in that country, to meet you, and they chased you, as do, bees; and struck you down in Seir, as far as Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So then ye returned and wept before Yahweh,but Yahweh hearkened not unto your voice, nor gave ear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And ye abode in Kadesh many days,how many were the days that ye abode</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
