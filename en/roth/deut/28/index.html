shall be, if thou wilt, hearken, unto the voice of Yahweh thy God, to observe to do all his commandments which I am commanding thee to-day, then will Yahweh thy God set thee on high, above all the nations of the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and all these blessings shall come in upon thee, and reach thee,because thou dost hearken unto the voice of Yahweh thy God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed shalt, thou be in the city,and blessed shalt thou be in the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle,the young of thy kine, and the ewes of thy flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Blessed, shall be thy basket and thy

giving unto thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yahweh will confirm thee unto himself for a holy people, as he sware unto thee,be-cause thou dost keep the commandments of Yahweh thy God, and dost walk in his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the peoples of the earth shall see that, the name of Yahweh, hath been called upon thee,and shall be afraid of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh will cause thee to abound in that which is good, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy soil,upon the soil which Yahweh sware unto thy fathers, to give unto thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yahweh will open unto thee his rich storehousethe heavens, to give the rain of thy land in its season, and to bless ever, work of thy hand, so shalt thou lend unto many nations, but thou, shalt not borrow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh, will give thee, to be the head, and not the tail, and thou shalt be only above, and shalt not be beneath,because thou dost hearken unto the commandments of Yahweh thy God, which I am commanding thee, to-day, to observe and to do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and dost not turn side from any of the words which I am commanding you to-day, to the right hand or to the left,to go after other gods,

the fruit of thy groundthe young of thy kine and the ewes of thy flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Cursed, shalt thou be, when thou comest in,and, cursed, shalt thou be, when thou goest out:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yahweh will send upon thee cursing, confusion and rebuke, in all whereunto thou settest thy hand that thou mayest do it,until thou he destroyed and until thou perish quickly, because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yahweh will cause to cleave unto theethe pestilence,until he hath consumed thee from off the soil which thou art entering to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yahweh, will smite thee, with consumption and with fever, and with inflammation and with violent heat and with the sword, and with blight and with mildew,and they shall pursue thee, until thou perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thy heavens which are over thy head shall become bronze,and the earth which is under thee iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yahweh will cause the rain of thy land to he powder and dust,out of the heavens, shall it come down upon thee, until thou he destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yahweh will give thee up to be routed before thine enemies, one way, shalt thou go out

become food for every bird of the heavens, and for the beast of the earth,with none to fright them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yahweh, will smite thee, with the burning sores of Egypt and with the hemorrhoids, and with scab, and with itch,of which thou canst not be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yahweh, will smite thee, with madness and with blindness,and with terror of heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and thou shalt he groping about in noonday brightness, as the blind man gropeth in thick darkness, and thou shalt not make thy ways prosper,but shalt be only oppressed and spoiled all the days with none to save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>A wife, shalt thou betroth, and, another man shall lie with her. A house, shalt thou build, and shalt not dwell therein,A vineyard, shalt thou plant, and shalt not throw it open;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thine ox slaughtered before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof, Thine ass stolen from before thee, and shall not be restored to thee,Thy flock given to thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thy sons and thy daughters given to another people, thine eyes looking on, and failing for them all the day, thine own hand being powerless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The fruit of thy soil, and all thy toilsome produce, shall a people whom thou knowest not, eat up,and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed, all the days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>so that thou shalt be mad,for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yahweh, will smite thee, with a grievous boil, upon the knees and upon the legs, of which thou canst not he healed,from the sole of thy foot even unto the crown of thy head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Yahweh will bring thee and thy king whom thou wilt set up over thee, unto a nation which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers,and thou shalt serve there other gods of wood and of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus shalt thou become a horror, a byword, and a mockery, among all the peoples whither Yahweh thy God will drive thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Much seed, shalt thou take out into the field,and little, shalt thou gather in, for the locust shall consume it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Vineyards, shalt thou plant, and dress,but wine, shalt thou not drink, neither shalt thou gather the grapes, for the worm shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Olive trees, shalt thou have in all thy bounds,but with oil, shalt thou not anoint thyself, for thine olives, shall drop off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Sons and daughters, shalt thou beget, and they shall not be thine, for they shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All thy trees, and the fruit of thy ground, shall the grasshopper, devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The sojourner who is in thy midst, shall mount up above thee higher and higher,whereas, thou, shalt come down lower and lower:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he, shall lend to thee, but, thou, shalt not lend to him,he, shall become head, and, thou, shalt become tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover, all these curses, shall come in upon thee, and pursue thee and overtake thee, until thou be destroyed,because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Yahweh thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he hath commanded thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and they shall be upon thee, for a sign, and for a wonder, and upon thy seed, unto times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Because thou servedst not Yahweh thy God, with rejoicing, and with gladness of heart, for abundance of all things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies, whom Yahweh will send against thee, with hunger and with thirst and with nakedness, and with want of all things,and he, will put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he hath destroyed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Yahweh will bring against thee a nation from afar, from the end of the earth, as darteth a bird of prey,a nation whose tongue thou canst not understand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>a nation of fierce countenance,who wilt not respect an elder nor to the young, show favour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>then shall be eat the young of thy cattle and the fruit of thy ground until thou art destroyed, who will not leave for thee corn, new wine or oil, the young of thy kine, or the ewes of thy flock,until he hath caused thee to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall lay siege to thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down wherein thou wast trusting, in all thy land,yea he will lay siege to thee in all thy gates, in all thy land which Yahweh thy God, hath given, unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And thou wilt eat the fruit of thy body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, whom Yahweh thy God hath given unto theein the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemy will straiten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The man that is tender among you, and exceedingly delicate, his eye will be jealous of his brother and of the wife of his bosom, and of the remnant of his sons, whom be might leave behind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>so that he will not give to any one of them, of the flesh of his sons which he will eat, because he hath nothing at all left him,in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemy will straiten thee within all thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The tender and delicate woman among you who hath never adventured the sole of her foot to set it upon the ground, through delicateness and through tenderness, her eye shall be jealous of the husband of her bosom, and of her own son, and of her own daughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>both as to her afterbirth that cometh forth from between her feet and as to her children which she shall bear, for she will eat them for want of all things secretly,in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemy will straiten thee within thine own gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If thou wilt not take heed to do all the words of this law, which are written in this scroll,to revere this glorious and reverend name, Yahweh thy God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>then will Yahweh make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed,plagues great and lasting, and diseases grievous and lasting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and he will bring back on thee all the sickness of Egypt, because of which thou wast afraid,and they shall cleave unto thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>even every disease and, every plague, which are not written in this scroll of the law, will Yahweh bring up against thee, until thou art destroyed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And ye shall be left men few in number, whereas ye had become as the stars of the heavens for multitude,because thou hast not hearkened unto the voice of Yahweh thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall come to pass that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you, so, will Yahweh rejoice over you, to cause you to perish and to destroy you,and ye shall be torn away, from off the soil, whither thou art going in to possess it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and Yahweh will scatter thee among all the peoples, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth,and thou wilt serve there other gods whom thou hast not knownthou nor thy fathers,of wood and of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among those nations, shalt thou find no ease, neither shall there be a place of rest for the sole of thy foot,but Yahweh will give unto thee there a trembling heart, and a failing of eyes and faintness of soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And thy life will be hung up for thee in front,and thou wilt be in dread by night and by day, and wilt not trust in thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning, thou wilt sayOh that it were evening! and in the evening, thou wilt sayOh that it were morning! because of the dread of thy heart which thou wilt dread, and because of the sight of thine eyes which thou wilt see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And Yahweh will take thee back again to Egypt in ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt not again any more see it. And ye will offer yourselves there for sale unto thine enemies as servants and as handmaids with no one to buy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
