So we passed over the ravine of Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now, the days in which we journeyed from Kadesh-barnea, as far as where we crossed the ravine of Zered, were thirty-eight years,until all the generation of the men of war were consumed out of the midst of the camp, as Yahweh had sworn unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yea, even the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them out of the midst of the camp,until they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed by dying, out of the midst of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then spake Yahweh unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou, art passing, to-day, the boundary of Moab even Ar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>so wilt thou draw near over against the sons of Ammon, do not thou besiege them neither engage in strife with them,for I will not give of the land of the sons of Ammon unto thee as a possession, for unto the sons of Lot, have I given it as a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A land of giants, used, that also, to be accounted,giants, dwelt therein aforetime, but the Ammonites, called them Zamzummim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>a people great and many and tall, like the Anakim,but Yahweh destroyed them from before them, and they took their possessions, and dwelt in their stead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>as he did for the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir,when he destroyed the Horim from before them, and they took their possessions and have dwelt in their stead, even unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Avvim also, who dwelt in settlements as far as Gaza, Caphtorim, who were coming forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Arise ye, set forward and cross over the ravine of Arnon, see! I have given into thy handSihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite and his land, begintake possession,and engage in strife with him in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This day, will I begin to extend the dread of thee and the fear of thee over the face of the peoples under all the heavens,who will hear the report of thee, then will they quake and writhe in pain because of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So I sent messengers out of the desert of Kademoth, unto Sihon, king of Heshbon,with words of peace saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I would pass along through thy land, by the road, by the road, will I go,I will not turn aside, to the right hand or to the left:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Food for silver, shalt thou sell me so will I eat, and water for silver, shalt thou let me have, so will I drink,only I would pass through on my feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>as the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, did to me, and the Moabites who are dwelling in Ar,until that I pass over the Jordan, into the land which, Yahweh our God, is giving unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Sihon king of Heshbon, was not willing, to let us pass along through it,for Yahweh thy God had suffered him to make his spirit harsh and his heart bold, that he might give him into thy hand(as   this day).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then said Yahweh unto me, See! I have begun to deliver up before thee Sihon and his land,begin take possession, that thou mayest make a possession of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So then Sihon came out to meet us he, and all his people, to give battle at Jahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Yahweh our God delivered him up before us,and we smote him and his sons, and all his people</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And we captured all his cities, at that time, and devoted to destruction every city of males, with the women and the little ones,we left not remaining a survivor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>only the cattle, made we our prey,and the spoil of the cities which we captured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the ravine of Arnon and the city that is in the ravine even as far as Gilead, there was not a fortress that proved too high for us,the whole, did Yahweh our God deliver up before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Only unto the land of the sons of Ammon, didst thou not come near,all the side of the Jabbok ravine, nor the cities of the hill country, nor any which Yahweh our God had forbidden to us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
