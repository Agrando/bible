Yahweh thy God shall bring thee into the land which thou art going in to possess, and shall clear away many nations from before theethe Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites, and the Canaanites and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusitesseven nations greater in number and stronger than thou;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and Yahweh thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them, thou shalt devote them to destruction, thou shalt not solemnise with them a covenant neither shalt thou shew them favour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>neither shalt thou intermarry with them,thy daughter, shalt thou not give unto his son, nor his daughter, shalt thou take for thy son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for he will turn aside thy son from following me, and they will serve other gods,so shall the anger of Yahweh kindle upon you, and he will destroy thee, speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Verily, thus, shall ye do unto them: Their altars, shall ye tear down, And their pillars, shall ye break in pieces,And their sacred stems, shall ye hew down, And their carved images, a shall ye burn up in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For a holy people, art thou unto Yahweh thy God: of thee, hath Yahweh thy God, made choice, that thou shouldest become his people as a treasure, above all the peoples that are on the face of the ground:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>not because ye were more in number than any of the peoples, did Yahweh become attached to you and make choice of you,for, ye, were fewer than any of the peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but because Yahweh loved you and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, did Yahweh bring you forth with a firm hand,and redeem thee out of the house of servants, out of the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then, thou must know that, Yahweh thy God, he, is God,the faithful GOD, keeping his covenant and his lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but requiting them who hate him unto his face to destroy them,he will not be slack towards him that hateth him, unto his face, will he requite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So shalt thou keep the commandment and the statutes and the regulations, which I am commanding thee to-day, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall it come to pass if ye will hearken unto these regulations, and keep and do them, then will Yahweh thy God keep with thee the covenant and the lovingkindness which he sware unto thy fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and will love thee, and bless thee and multiply thee,and bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground thy corn and a thy new wine and thine ell the young of thy kine and the ewes of thy flock, upon the soil which he swart unto thy fathers to give unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blessed shalt thou be beyond all the peoples,there shall not be in thee a barren male or female, nor among thy cattle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Yahweh, will turn away, from thee, all disease,and as for all the sore sicknesses of Egypt which thou knowest, he will not lay them upon thee, but will put them upon all who hate thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and thou shalt devour all the peoples whom, Yahweh thy God, delivering up unto thee, thine eye shall not look with pity upon them, neither shalt thou serve their gods, for a snare, would it be unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Although thou mightest say in thy heart: More in number, are these nations than I,how can, I dispossess them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>thou must not be afraid of them,thou must, remember, what Yahweh thy God did, unto Pharaoh and unto all Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the great provings which thine own eyes saw, and the signs and the wonders and the firm hand and the stretched-out arm, wherewith Yahweh thy God brought thee forth,so, will Yahweh thy God do unto all the peoples, before whom thou art afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover also, the hornet, will Yahweh thy God send among them,until they are destroyed who are left remaining, and who are hiding themselves from thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shalt not be affrighted at their presence,for Yahweh thy God in thy midst is a Go great and to be revered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So will Yahweh thy God, clear away these nations from before thee little by little,thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the wild beast of the field should multiply ever thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Yahweh thy God will deliver them up before thee,and discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they are destroyed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and will deliver their kings into thy hand and thou shalt destroy their name, from under the heavens,not a man shall stand before thee, until thou hast destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The carved images of their gods, shalt thou consume with fire,thou shalt not covet the silver and gold upon them to take unto thee, lest thou be ensnared thereby; for the abomination of Yahweh thy God, it is;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and so become devoted to destruction, like it, thou shalt, abhor, it, and thou shalt, loathe it, because a thing devoted to destruction, it is.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
