the month of Abib, when thou shalt keep a passover unto Yahweh thy God,for in the month of Abib, did Yahweh thy God bring thee forth out of Egypt by night:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>therefore shalt thou sacrifice a passover unto Yahweh thy God of flock or herd,in the place which Yahweh shall choose to make a habitation for his name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou shalt not eat therewith any thing leavened, seven days, shalt thou eat therewith unleavened cakes the bread of humiliation,for in haste, camest thou forth out of the land of Egypt, that thou mayest remember the day when thou earnest forth out of the land of Egypt, all the days of thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there shall not be seen with thee leaven in any of thy bounds seven days,neither shall there remain all night of the flesh which thou shalt sacrifice in the evening, on the first day, unto the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover,within any of thine own gates which Yahweh thy God is giving unto thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but in the

class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Seven weeks, shalt thou count unto thee,from the beginning of thrusting in the sickle into the standing corn, shalt thou begin to count, seven weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So shalt thou keep the festival of weeks unto Yahweh thy God, in the measure of the freewill offering of thy hand which thou shalt give,as Yahweh thy God shall bless thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So shalt thou rejoice before Yahweh thy Godthou, and thy son and thy daughter and thy servant and thy handmaid, and the Levite who is within thy

hands,therefore shalt thou do nothing but, rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Three times in the year, shall each one of thy males see the face of Yahweh thy God, in the place which he shall choose, at the festival of unleavened cakes and at the festival of weeks and at the festival of booths,and none shall see the face of Yahweh empty-handed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>every man according as his hand can give,according to the blessing of Yahweh thy God, which he hath bestowed upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Judges and
