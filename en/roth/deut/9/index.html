thou art passing, to-day, over the Jordan, to go in to dispossess nations, greater and stronger than thou,cities great and fortified into the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>a people great and tall, the sons of Anakim,whom, thou, knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So then, thou must consider to-day, that Yahweh thy God, he it is that is passing over before thee as a consuming fire, he, will destroy them, and, he, will cause them to bow down before thee,so shalt thou dispossess them, and destroy them speedily, as Yahweh hath spoken unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do not speak in thy heart, when Yahweh thy God casteth them out from before thee saying, For mine own righteousness, hath Yahweh brought me in, to possess this land,whereas it is for the lawlessness of these nations, that, Yahweh, is dispossessing them from before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Not for thine own righteousness, nor for the uprightness of thine own heart, art thou going in to possess their land,but or the lawlessness of these nations, is, Yahweh thy God driving them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh sware unto thy fathers, unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So then, thou must consider that, not for thine own righteousness, is Yahweh thy God giving unto thee this good land to possess it,for a stiff-necked people, thou art.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rememberdo not forget, how thou didst provoke Yahweh thy God, in the desert,yea from the day when thou earnest forth out of the and of Egypt until ye entered as far as this place, have ye been quarrelling, with Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Even in Horeb, ye provoked Yahweh to wrath,so that Yahweh showed himself angry with you to destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When I went up into the mountain to receive the tables of stonethe tables of the covenant, which Yahweh had solemnised with you, then abode I in the mountain forty days and forty nights, food, did I not, eat, and water, did I not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then did Yahweh deliver unto me the two tables of stone, written with the finger of God,and   upon them, according to all the words which Yahweh had spoken with you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the convocation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So then it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave unto me the two tables of stone the tables of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said Yahweh unto meUp! get down quickly out of this mountain, for thy people whom thou hast brought forth out of Egypt, have broken faith,they have turned aside quickly, out of the way which I commanded them,they have made them a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh spake unto me saying,I have looked on this people, and lo! a stiff-necked people, it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and wipe out their name from under the heavens,and make thee into a nation stronger and more in number than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I turned, and came down out of the mountain, now the mountain was burning with fire,and the two tables of the covenant were upon my two hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then looked I, and lo! ye had sinned against Yahweh your God, ye had made you a molten calf,ye had turned aside quickly, out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So I seized the two tables, and cast them from off my two hands,and brake them in pieces before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then lay I prostrate before Yahweh as at the first, forty days and forty nights, food, did I not eat, and water, did I not drink,because of all your sin which ye had sinned, in doing the thing that was wicked, in the eyes of Yahweh. to provoke him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I shrank with fear from the face of the anger and the hot displeasure, wherewith Yahweh was provoked against you to destroy you,but Yahweh hearkened unto me, even at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And with Aaron, did Yahweh show himself exceedingly angry, to destroy him,so I prostrated myself, even in behalf of Aaron at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And your sin which ye had made even the calf, took I and burned it up with fire, and pounded it very small, until it was fine as dust,then cast I the dust thereof into the torrent that descended out of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also, at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hataavah, a cause of provocation, became ye unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Also when Yahweh sent you out of Kadesh-barnea saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given unto you then quarreled ye with the bidding of Yahweh your God, and trusted him not, neither hearkened unto his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye have been quarrelling, with Yahweh,from the day that I first knew you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus, then lay I prostrate before Yahweh, the forty days and the forty nights that I did lie prostrate,because Yahweh spake of destroying you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I prostrated myself unto Yahweh and said, My Lord Yahweh! Do not destroy thy people even thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness,which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a firm hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Have remembrance of thy servants, of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob,do not regard the obduracy of this people, or their lawlessness or their sin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>lest the land out of which thou hast brought us forth say, Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land of which he had spoken to them,and because he hated them, took he them forth to put them to death in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet, they, are thy people and thine inheritance,whom thou hast brought forth with thy great strength, and with thy stretched-out arm.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
