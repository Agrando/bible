Hallowed be thy name, Come may thy kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Our needful bread, be giving us, day by day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And forgive us our sins, for, even we ourselves, forgive every one indebted to us; And bring us not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto themWho from among you, shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto himFriend! supply me with three loaves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>forasmuch as, a friend of mine, hath come off a journey unto me, and I have not what I can set before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and, he, from within, shall answer, and sayBe not disturbing me,already, the door hath been fastened, and, my children, with me, are, in bed: I cannot rise and give thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say unto youEven though he will not give him, rising because of his being a friend of his, because, at least, of his importunity, he will rouse himself, and give him as many as he needeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I, therefore, unto you, sayBe asking, and it shall be given to you, Be seeking, and ye shall find,Be knocking, and it shall be opened unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, whosoever asketh, receiveth, and, he that seeketh, findeth,and, to him that knocketh, shall it be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But which is the father, from among yourselves, whom the son will ask for, a fish, who, instead of a fish, will give him, a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Or shall also ask, an egg, who will give him, a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If therefore, ye, being, evil, know how to be giving, good gifts, unto your children, how much rather, will, the heavenly Father, give Holy Spirit unto them that ask him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he was casting out a demon that was dumb; and it came to pass, when the demon went out, the dumb began speaking. And the multitudes marvelled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but, some from among them, saidIn Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, is he casting out the demons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and, others, putting him to the test, a sign out of heaven, were seeking from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, he, knowing their thoughts, said unto themEvery kingdom, against itself divided, is laid waste, and, a house, against a house,   , falleth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, if, even Satan, against himself hath become divided, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye are saying that, in Beelzebul, am I casting out the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, if, I, in Beelzebul, am casting out the demons, In whom are, your sons, casting them out? Wherefore, they, shall be, your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, if, with the finger of God, I, am casting out the demons, then doubtless unawares hath come upon you, the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whensoever, the mighty one, armed, may be guarding his own dwelling, in peace, are his goods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But, whensoever, a mightier than he, shall come upon and vanquish him, his panoply, he taketh away, wherein he was trusting, and, his spoils, he distributeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that is not with me, is, against me; and, he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whensoever, the impure spirit, goeth out from the man, it passeth through waterless places, seeking rest; and, not finding it,  then,  it saith, I will return unto my house, whence I came out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and, coming, findeth it,  empty,  swept, and adorned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then, goeth it, and taketh along with itself, other spirits, more wicked than itselfseven, and, entering in, fixeth its dwelling there; and, the last state of that man, becometh, worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now it came to pass, while he was saying these things, that a certain woman out of the multitude, lifting up her voice, said unto himHappy the womb that bare thee! And the breasts which thou didst suck!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, he, saidYea rather!Happy they who hear the word of God, and observe it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, as the multitudes were thronging together, he began to be sayingThis generation, is, a wicked generation: A sign, it is seeking, and, a sign, shall not be given it, save the sign of Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For, according as, Jonah, became, unto the Ninevites, a sign, so, shall be, the Son of Man also, unto this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the south, will rise up, in the judgment, with the men of this generation, and will condemn them; because she came out of the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,and lo! something more than Solomon, here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Men of Nineveh, will rise up, in the judgment, with this generation, and will condemn it; because they repented into the proclamation of Jonah,and lo! something more than Jonah, here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>No one, having lighted, a lamp, into a covered place, a putteth it, nor, under the measure; but upon the lampstand, that they who enter may see, the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of thy body, is thine eye: Whensoever, thine eye, may be, single, even the whole of thy body, is, lighted up; but, whensoever it may be, useless, even thy body, is darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Be looking to it, therefore, lest, the light that is in thee, be, darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If, therefore, thy whole body, is lighted up, not having any part darkened, the whole, shall be lighted up, as whensoever, the lamp, with its radiance, may be giving thee light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, when he had spoken, a Pharisee was requesting him that he would dine with him; and, entering, he reclined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, the Pharisee, beholding, marvelled that he was not, first, immersed, before the dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the Lord said unto him: Now, ye, the Pharisees, the outside of the cup and of the tray, do make pure; but, your inward part, is full of plunder and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Simple ones! Did not, he who made the outside, the inside also, make?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Notwithstanding, as to the things within, give alms, and lo! everything, is, pure unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But alas for you, the Pharisees! because ye tithe the mint, and the rue, and every garden herb, and pass by justice, and the love of God. But, these things, it was biding to do, and, those, not to pass by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Alas for you, the Pharisees! because ye love the first seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the market-places!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Alas for you! because ye are as the secret tombs: even the men that are walking above them, know it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, making answer, one of the Lawyers saith unto him, Teacher! these things, saying, us also, dost thou insult!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And, he, saidAnd, for you, the lawyers, alas! because ye lade men with burdens hard to be borne, and, yourselves, with one of your fingers, touch not the burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Alas for you! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers slew them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Hence, witnesses, are ye, and find consenting pleasure in the works of your fathers: because, they, indeed, slew them, and, ye, are building,   .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For this cause, the Wisdom of God hath saidI will send forth, unto them, prophets and apostles,and, some from among them, will they slay, and,   persecute:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>That the blood of all the prophets which hath been shed from the foundation of the world, may be sought out, from this generation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>From the blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zachariah who was destroyed betwixt the altar and the house; Yea! I say unto youIt shall be sought out from this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Alas for you, the lawyers! because ye took away the key of knowledge: yourselves, entered not, and, them who were entering, ye hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And, when, from thence, he came out, the Scribes and the Pharisees began, with vehemence, to be hemming him in, and trying to make him speak off-hand concerning many things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>lying in wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
