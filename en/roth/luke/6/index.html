And, arising, he stood forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jesus said unto themI ask you, whether it is allowed, on the Sabbath, to do good or to do harm,life, to save, or, to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, looking round upon them all, he said unto himStretch forth thy hand! and, he, did so, and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, they, were filled with folly, and began conversing one with another, as to, what they might do with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, in these days, that he went forth into the mountain to pray, and was spending the night in the prayer-house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, when it became day, he called his disciples, and chose from them, twelve, whom also he named, Apostles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom also he named Peter, and Andrew hie brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Matthew and Thomas; and James, son of Alphaeus, and Simon, who was called Zealot; and Judas,   of James,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Judas Iscariot, who became betrayer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and, coming down with them, he stood upon a level place, also a great multitude of his disciples,and a great throng of the people, from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Zidon, who had come to hearken unto him and to be healed from their diseases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and, they who were molested by impure spirits, were being cured;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and, all the multitude, were seeking to touch him, because, power, from him, was coming forth, and healing all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, he, lifting up his eyes towards his disciples, was saying:Happy, ye destitute, for, yours, is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Happy, ye that hunger now, for ye shall be filled. Happy, ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Happy, are ye, whensoever men shall hate you, and whensoever they shall separate you, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>be rejoiced in that day, and leap, for lo! your reward, is great in heaven; for, according to the same things, were their fathers doing unto the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But alas! for you, ye wealthy, for ye are duly receiving you consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Alas! for you, ye who are filled full now, for ye shall hunger. Alas! ye that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Alas! whensoever all men shall, speak well of you, for, according to the same things, were their fathers doing unto the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, unto you, I say, who are hearkening: Be loving your enemies; be doing, good, unto them that hate you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be blessing them that curse you; be praying for them that wantonly insult you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who is smiting thee upon the one cheek, be offering, the other also; and, from him who is taking away thy mantle, thy tunic also, do not forbid:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>To every one asking thee, give, and, from him that taketh away thy possessions, ask them not back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, according as ye desire that men be doing unto you, be ye doing unto them, in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, if ye love them that love you, what sort of thanks are there for you? for, even sinners, love, such as love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For , if ye even do good unto them that do good unto you, what sort of thanks are there for you? Even sinners, the same, are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, if ye lend to them from whom ye are hoping to receive, what sort of thanks are there for you? Even sinners, unto sinners, do lend, that they may receive back, as much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for, nothing, back; and your reward shall be, great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High,for, he, is, gracious, unto the ungrateful and wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Become ye compassionate, according as, your Father, is, compassionate;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And do not judge, and in nowise shall ye be judged; and do not condemn, and in nowise shall ye be condemned; release, and ye shall be released;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it shall be given unto you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will they give into your lap; for, with what measure ye mete, shall it be measured back unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He spake, moreover, a parable also, unto them: Can, the blind, guide, the blind? will not, both, fall into, a ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A disciple is not above the teacher; but, when trained, every one shall be as his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But why beholdest thou the mote that is in the eye of thy brother, while, the beam that is in thine own eye, thou dost not consider?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>How canst thou say to thy brotherBrother! let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye,thyself, the beam in thine own eye, not beholding? Hypocrite! cast out, first, the beam out of thine own eye, and, then, shalt thou see clearly, to cast out, the mote that is in the eye of thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For a good tree doth not produce worthless fruit, neither again doth, a worthless tree, produce good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For, every tree, by its own fruit, becometh known. For not, of thorns, do they gather figs, neither, of a bramble-bush, do they gather, a bunch of grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and, the wicked man, out of the wicked heart, bringeth forth that which is wicked; for, out of an overflowing of heart, speaketh, his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And why call ye me, Lord! Lord! and not do the things that I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Every one coming unto me, and hearkening unto my words, and doing them, I will suggest to you, whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like unto a man building a house, who digged, and deepened, and laid a foundation upon the rock,and, a flood, coming, the stream burst against that house, and was not strong enough to shake it, because it had been, well, built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But, he that hath heard and not done, is like unto a man having built a house upon the earth, without a foundation,against which the stream burst, and, straightway, it fell in; and it came to pass, that, the crash of that house, was, great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
