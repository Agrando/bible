And, he, answering him, saidThou, sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, Pilate, said unto the High-priests and the multitudes, Nothing, find I, worthy of blame, in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But, they, began to be urgent, sayingHe is stirring up the people, teaching along all Judaea, even beginning from Galilee unto this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, Pilate, hearing   , questioned whether the man was, a Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, getting to know that he was of the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him back unto Herod, he also, being in Jerusalem in these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, Herod, seeing Jesus, rejoiced exceedingly; for he had been, a considerable number of times, wishing to see him,because he had heard concerning him, and was hoping, some sign, to behold, by him, brought to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he went on to question him in a good many words; but, he, answered him, nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the High-priests and the Scribes stood vehemently accusing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Herod with his soldiery, having set him at nought, and mocked him, threw about him a gorgeous robe, and sent him back unto Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they became friendsboth Herod and Pilateon the self-same day, one with another; for they had previously been at enmity between themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, Pilate, calling together the High-priests, and the Rulers, and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>said unto themYe brought unto me this man, as one turning away the people, and lo! I, in your presence, examining him, found, nothing, in this man worthy of blame, in respect of the things whereof ye were making accusation against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nay! nor Herod; for he hath sent him back unto you,and lo! nothing worthy of death, hath been done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So, then, chastising him, I will release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But they cried aloud, with the whole throng, sayingAway with this man! and release unto us Barabbas:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who indeed, because of a certain revolt which had occurred in the city, and of murder, had been thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, however, Pilate, called out unto them, wishing to release Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, they, called out in return, sayingCrucify! crucify him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, he, the third time, said unto themWhy! what base thing hath this man done? Nothing worthy of death, found I in him. Chastising him, then, I will release him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But they became urgent with loud voices, claiming to have him crucified; and their voices began to prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, Pilate, consented, that their request should be granted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and released him who, for revolt and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they claimed,whereas, Jesus, delivered he up unto their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, as they led him away, they laid hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the country,they laid on him the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there was following him a great throng of the people, and of women, who were smiting themselves and lamenting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, turning towards them, Jesus saidDaughters of Jerusalem! Do not weep for me; but, for yourselves, be weeping, and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For lo! days are coming, in which they will sayHappy the barren! even the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then, will they begin to sayunto the mountains, Fall upon us! and unto the hills, Cover us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because if, in moist wood, these things, they are doing,in, the dry, what shall happen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And there were being led, two other evil-doers also, to be lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, when they came into the place which was called Skull, there, they crucified him; and the evil-doers, one indeed on the right hand, and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, when they were parting his garments, they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people were standing, looking on. But the rulers were sneering, sayingOthers, he saved, let him save himself,if, this, is, the Christ of God, the Chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Moreover the soldiers also mocked him,coming near, offering, vinegar, unto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and sayingIf, thou, art the King of the Jews, save thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now there was an inscription also, over himTHE KING OF THE JEWS, THIS!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, one of the suspended evil-doers, began to defame himArt not, thou, the Christ? Save thyself and us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the other, answering, rebuked him, and saidNeither fearest, thou, God, in that thou art, in the same judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And, we, indeed, justly,for, things worthy of what we have done, are we duly receiving, but, this man, nothing amiss, hath done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went on to sayJesus! remember me, whensoever thou shalt come into thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said unto himVerily, I say unto thee this day: With me, shalt thou be in Paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And it was already about the sixth hour, and, darkness, came upon the whole land, until the ninth hour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>the sun failing; and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, calling out with a loud voice, Jesus saidFather! into thy hands, I commend my spirit. And, this, saying, he ceased to breathe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the centurion, beholding that which came to pass, began to glorify God, sayingIn very deed, this man, was, righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, all the multitudes who had been drawn together unto this spectacle, having looked upon the things that came to pass, smiting their breasts, began to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But all they who were acquainted with him, were standing afar off, women also who had followed with him from Galilee,beholding these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And lo! a man, by name Joseph, being, a councillor,a good and righteous man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>(the same had not consented unto their plan and deed),from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was awaiting the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>the same, going unto Pilate, claimed the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And, taking it down, he wrapped it in a fine Indian cloth, and laid him in a tomb hewn in stone,where no one as yet was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it was a day of preparation, and, a Sabbath, was about to dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the women, they who had come out of Galilee with him, following after, observed the tomb, and how his body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And, returning, they made ready spices and perfumes. And, on the Sabbath, indeed, they were quiet, according to the commandment;</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
