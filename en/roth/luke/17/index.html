Master! have mercy on us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, beholding, he said unto themGo your way, and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they withdrew, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, one from among them, beholding that he was healed, returned, with a loud voice, glorifying God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and fell prostrate at his feet, giving him thanks; and, he, was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus, answering, saidWere not, the ten, cleansed?  but,  where, are, the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Have none been found returning to give glory to God, save this one of another race?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto himArise and go thy way: thy faith, hath saved thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, being questioned by the Pharisees, When cometh the kingdom of God? he answered them and saidThe kingdom of God cometh not with narrow watching;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Neither shall they sayLo, here! or, There. For lo! the kingdom of God, is, among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he said unto the disciplesThere will come dayswhen ye will long to see, one of the days of the Son of Man, and shall not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say unto you, Lo there! or, Lo here! Do not  depart, and do not  pursue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, just as, the lightning, flashing out of the one part under heaven, unto the other part under heaven, shineth, so, shall be, the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, first, he must needs suffer, many things, and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, as it came to pass in the days of Noah, so, will it be, even in the days of the Son of Man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage,until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In like manner, as it came to pass in the days of Lot, They were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But, on the day Lot came out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>According to the same things, will it be on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his utensils in the house, let him not go down, to take them away! And, he that is in the field, in like manner, let him not turn unto the things behind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Bear in mind the wife of Lot! Whosoever shall seek to make his life his own, shall lose it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But, whosoever shall lose it, shall give it a living birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I say unto youOn the selfsame night, there shall be two men on  one  bed,the one, shall be taken near, and, the other, left behind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There shall be two women grinding together,the one, shall be taken near, and, the other, left behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, answering, they say unto himWhere, Lord? And, he, said unto themWhere the body is, there, the vultures also, will be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
