I will send my son, the beloved,It may be, that, him, they will respect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he husbandmen, seeing him, began to deliberate one with another, sayingThis, is, the heir: Let us slay him, that, ours, may be, the inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, thrusting him forth outside the vineyard, they slew him. What, then, will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come, and destroy these husbandmen, and give the vineyard unto others. But, when they heard it, they saidFar be it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, he, looking at them, saidWhat, then, is this that is written,A stone which the builders rejected, The same, hath become, head of the corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one who falleth on that stone, will be sorely bruised, but, on whomsoever it shall fall, it will utterly destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Scribes and the High-priests sought to thrust on him their hands, in that very hour; and feared the people; for they perceived that, against them, spake he this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, watching narrowly, they sent forth suborned men, feigning themselves to be, righteous, that they might lay hold of a word of his, so as to deliver him up unto the rule and the authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they questioned him, sayingTeacher! we know that, rightly, thou speakest and teachest, and respectest no person, but, in truth, the way of God, dost teach:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it allowable for us to give, unto Caesar, tribute, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, observing their villainy, he said unto them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shew me a denary. Of whom, hath it an image and inscription? And, they, saidOf Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, he, said unto themWell then! render the things of Caesar, unto Caesar, and the things of God, unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they could not lay hold of the saying, before the people; and, marvelling at his answer, they held their peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But there came near certain of the Sadducees, they who say, Resurrection, there is none! and questioned him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>sayingTeacher! Moses, wrote for us, If ones brother die, having a wife, and, he, be, childless, that his brother shall take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Seven brethren, therefore, there were,and, the first, taking a wife, died childless,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, the second,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the third, took her,yea, likewise, even the seven; They left no children, and died:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Later on, the woman also, died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The woman, therefore, in the resurrection, Of which of them, doth she become wife? for, the seven, had her to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said unto themThe sons of this age, marry, and are given in marriage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But, they who have been accounted worthy, that age, to obtain, and the resurrection that is from among the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For they cannot, even die any more,for, equal unto messengers, are they, and are, sons of God, Of the resurrection, being, sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, that the dead do rise, even Moses, disclosed at the bush, when he calleth the LordThe God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now, God, he is not, of the dead, but, of the living,for, all, unto him, do live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And certain of the Scribes, answering, saidTeacher! Well, hast thou spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For, no longer, were they daring to ask him any questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said unto themHow say they, that, the Christ, is, Davids Son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For, David himself, saith, in   book of Psalms: Said the Lord, unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David, therefore, calleth, him Lord: How, then, his son, is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, all the people hearing, he said unto the disciples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Be taking heed of the ScribesWho desire to walk about in long robes, and are fond of salutations in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in the chief meals,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Who devour the houses of widows, and, for a show, are a long time at prayer. These, shall receive, a heavier sentence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
