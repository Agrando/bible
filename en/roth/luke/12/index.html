By how much do, ye, excel, the birds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, who from among you, though anxious, can, unto his stature, add a cubit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If then, not even the least thing, ye can do, why, concerning the rest, are ye anxious?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider well the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin, and yet I say unto youNot even Solomon, in all his glory, was arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, if God thus adorneth, the grass, which is, in a field, to-day, and, to-morrow, into an oven, is cast, how much rather you, O little-of-faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Ye, therefore, be not seeking what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink, and be not held in suspense;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For, after all these things, do, the nations of the world, seek,but, your Father, knoweth that ye need these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Notwithstanding, be seeking his kingdom,and, these things, shall be added unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Be not afraid, the dear little flock! for your Father delighteth to give you, the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell your possessions, and give alms, make for yourselves purses that wax not old,treasure unfailing, in the heavens, where, thief, doth not draw near, and, moth, doth not spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For, where your treasure is, there, will your heart he also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, ye yourselves, like unto men awaiting their own lord, once he may break up out of the marriage-feast,that, when he cometh and knocketh, straightway, they may open unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Happy those servants, whom the lord, when he cometh, shall find watching! Verily, I say unto youhe will gird himself, and make them recline, and, coming near, will minister unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, if, in the second, or if, in the third, watch, he come and find, thus, happy, are, they!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But, of this, be taking noteHad the householder known, in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not suffered his house, to be digged through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Ye, therefore, be getting ready, because, in what hour ye are not thinking, The Son of an cometh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But Peter saidLord! unto us, this parable, speakest thou? or, even unto all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord saidWho then is the faithful steward, the prudent one, whom the lord will appoint over his body of attendants, to be giving, in due season, the measured allowance of wheat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Happy, that servant, whom the lord, when he cometh shall find doing, thus!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Of a truth, I say unto youOver all his possessions, will he appoint him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But, if that servant should say in his heartMy lord delayeth to come! and should begin to be striking the youths and the maidens,to be eating also, and drinking, and making himself drunk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The lord of that servant, will have comeon a day when he is not expecting, and in an hour when he is not taking note,and will cut him asunder, and, his part, with the unfaithful, will appoint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, that servant, who had come to know the will of his lord, and neither prepared, nor wrought unto his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Whereas, he who had not come to know, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. And, every one to whom was given much, much, shall be sought from him; and, he to whom they committed much, for more than common, will they ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Fire, came I to cast upon the earth,and what can I wish, if, already, it hath been, kindled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But, an immersion, have I, to be immersed with, and how am I distressed, until it be ended!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Suppose ye, that, peace, I am come to give in the earth? Nay, I tell you, but rather division.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For there shall be, henceforth, five in one house, divided,three against two, and two against three:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>There shall be dividedFather against son, and son against father, mother against daughter, and daughter against the mother,mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he went on to say, even unto the multitudes,Whensoever ye see a cloud springing up from the west, straightway, ye are sayingA thunderstorm is coming! and it happeneth thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And, whensoever a south wind, blowing, ye sayA scorching heat, will there be! and it cometh to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Hypocrites! the face of the earth and of the heaven, ye know how to scan; but, this season, how know ye not to scan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Why, moreover, even from yourselves, judge ye not what is just?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For, as thou art going along with thine adversary unto a ruler, on the way, take pains to get a release from him; lest once he drag thee along unto the judge, and, the judge, deliver thee up to the punisher,and, the punisher, cast thee into prison:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell theeIn nowise shalt thou come out from thence, until, even the last fraction, thou pay!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
