But, they, held their peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And taking hold   he healed and dismissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and, unto them, saidWhich of you, shall have a son or an ox that, into a pit, shall fall, and will not straightway pull him up, on the day of rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they could not return an answer unto these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he went on to speak, unto the invited, a parable,observing how, the first couches, they were choosing; saying unto them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whensoever thou hast been invited by anyone unto a marriage feast, do not recline on the first couch; lest once, a more honourable than thou, have been invited by him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he that invited both thee and him should come, and say unto theeGive, unto this one, place! and, then, thou shouldst begin, with shame, the last place, to occupy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, whensoever thou hast been invited, pass on and fall back into the last place, that, whensoever he that hath invited thee shall come, he may say unto theeFriend! come close up, higher. Then, shalt thou have honour before all who are reclining together with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because, everyone who exalteth himself, shall be abased; and, he that abaseth himself, shall be exalted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover he went on to say, unto him also who had invited him,Whensoever thou mayest be making a dinner or a supper, do not call thy friends, or thy brothers, or thy kinsfolk, or rich neighbours,lest once, they also, invite thee in return, and it become a recompense unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But, whensoever, an entertainment, thou mayest be making, invite the destitute, the tried, the lame, the blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and, happy, shalt thou be, that they have not wherewith to recompense thee, for it shall be recompensed unto thee, in the resurrection of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of those reclining together, hearing these things, said unto himHappy, whoever shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, he, said unto himA certain man, was making a great supper, and invited many;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he sent out his servant, at the hour of the supper, to say unto the invitedBe coming! because, even now, is it, ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they all began, one after another to excuse themselves. The first, said unto himA field, have I bought, and have need to go out and see it: I request thee, hold me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, another, saidFive yoke of oxen, have I bought, and am going my way to prove them; I request thee, hold me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, another, saidA wife, have I married, and, for this cause, I cannot come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, going near, the servant reported unto his lord these things. Then, provoked to anger, the master of the house said unto his servantGo out quickly, into the broadways and streets of the city,and, the destitute, and tried, and blind, and lame, bring thou in here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant saidLord! what thou didst order, hath been done; and, yet, there is, room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the lord said unto the servantGo out among the highways and fences, and compel them to come in; that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, I say unto youNot one of those men who had been invited, shall taste of my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there were journeying together with him many multitudes; and, turning, he said unto them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, further also, even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whoever beareth not his own cross, and cometh after me, cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For, who from among you, wishing to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost,whether he hath sufficient for completion;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>lest once, he having laid a foundation, and not being able to finish, all who are looking on, should begin to mock at him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>sayingThis man, began to build, and was not able to finish!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or, what king, moving on to encounter, another king, in battle, will not sit down first and take counsel, whether he is able, with ten thousand, to meet him who, with twenty thousand, is coming against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, if not, by any means, while he is yet afar off, he sendeth, an embassy, and requesteth the conditions of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus, therefore, everyone from amongst you, who doth not bid adieu unto all his own possessions, cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Good, therefore is the salt; but, if, even the salt, become tasteless, wherewith shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Neither for land nor for manure, is it, fit: outside, they cast it!
