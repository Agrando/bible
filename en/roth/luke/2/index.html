And, on earth, peace, among men of goodwill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when the messengers had departed from them into heaven, that, the shepherds, began to say one to anotherLet us go through forthwith as far as to Bethlehem, and see this thing which hath come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came, with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, when they beheld, they made known concerning the thing which had been told them as to this child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, all who heard, marvelled concerning the things which had been told by the shepherds unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but, Mary, was closely observing, all, these things, putting them together in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the shepherds returned, giving glory and singing praise unto God, over all things which they had heard and seen, according as it had been told unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, then was his name called, Jesus,which it was called by the messenger, before he was conceived in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, when the days of their purification, according to the law of Moses, were fulfilled, they took him up into Jerusalem, to present   unto the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>according as it is written in the law of the LordEvery male that is a firstborn, Holy unto the Lord, shall be called,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to give a sacrifice, according to that which is said in the law of the LordA pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And lo! there was, a man, in Jerusalem, whose name, was Symeon; and, this man, was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and Holy Spirit was upon him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and it had been intimated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came, in the Spirit, into the temple; and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do according to that which was customary by the law concerning it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>even he, welcomed it into his arms, and blessed God, and said</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, dost thou dismiss thy servant, O Sovereign, according to thy declarationin peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which thou hast prepared in face of all the peoples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A light for the unveiling of nations, and the glory of thy people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his father and mother were marvelling over the things which were being spoken concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Symeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his motherLo! this one, is being set for the falling and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign to be spoken against;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, thou! through thy very soul, shall pass a sword, that, reasonings, may be revealed, out of many hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher;the same, advanced in many days; having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and, she, had been a widow for as long as eighty-four years,who left not the temple, with fastings and supplications, rendering divine service night and day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and, in that very hour, coming near, she began to give thanks unto God, and to speak concerning him unto all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, when they had finished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, into their own city, Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And, the child, went on growing, and waxing strong, becoming filled with wisdom; and, the favour of God, was upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And his parents used to journey yearly into Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, when he became twelve years, and they went up, according to the custom of the feast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and completed the days, and then were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem,and his parents noticed it not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but, supposing him to be in the company, went a days journey, and then began to seek for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and, not finding him, returned unto Jerusalem, seeking him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting amidst the teachers,both hearkening unto them, and questioning them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now all who heard him were beside themselves, because of his understanding and his answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And, when they behold him, they were astounded, and his mother said unto himChild! why, hast thou dealt with us, thus? Lo! thy father and I, in anguish, were seeking thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he said unto themWhy was it that ye were seeking me? Perceived ye not, that, in the courts of my Father, I must needs be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And, they, understood not the thing which he spake to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was submitting himself unto them. And, his mother, was closely observing all these things in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And, Jesus, went on advancing in wisdom, and in stature, and in favour with God and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
