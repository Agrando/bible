Inasmuch as thy supplication hath been hearkened to,and, thy wife Elizabeth, shall bring forth a son to thee, and thou shalt call his name, John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there shall be joy to thee and exulting, and, many, over his birth, shall rejoice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he shall be great before the Lord, and, wine and strong drink, in nowise may he drink, and, with Holy Spirit, shall he be filled, already, from his mothers womb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, many of the Sons of Israel, shall he turn towards the Lord their God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, he, shall go before him, in the spirit and power of Elijah,To turn the hearts of fathers unto children, and the unyielding, into the prudence of the righteous, and to prepare, for the Lord, a people made ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Zachariah said unto the messengerWhereby, shall I know this? for, I, am, aged, and, my wife, advanced in her days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the messenger, answering, said unto himI, am Gabriel,he that standeth near before God; and have been sent forth to speak unto thee, and to deliver the joyful message unto thee, as touching these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And lo! thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak until the day when these things shall come to pass; because thou didst not believe in my words,the which shall be fulfilled for their season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people were expecting Zachariah, and began to marvel that he should tarry in the Temple;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and when he came forth he was not able to speak unto them, and they perceived that, a vision, he had seen in the Temple,and, he, continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when the days of his public ministration were fulfilled, that he departed unto his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she disguised herself five months, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus, for me, hath the Lord wrought,in the days in which he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now, in the sixth month, was the messenger Gabriel sent forth from God, into a city of Galilee, the name of which was Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>unto a virgin, betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and, the name of the virgin, was, Mary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and entering in unto her, he saidJoy to thee, favoured one!

Elizabeth thy kinswoman, even she, hath conceived a son in, her old-age;and, this month, is, the sixth, to her, the so-called barren one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Because no declaration from God, shall be void of power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Mary saidLo! the handmaid of the Lord! Might it come to pass unto me, according to thy declaration. And the messenger departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary, arising, in these days, journeyed into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and entered into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass that, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and lifted up her voice with loud exclamation, and saidBlessed, art thou among women, and, blessed, is the fruit of thy womb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And, whence, to me is, this, That the mother of my Lord should come, unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For lo! as the sound of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe in my womb, leapt in exultation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, happy, is she who hath believed, that there shall be a perfecting of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary saidMy soul doth magnify the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirit hath exulted upon God my saviour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Because he hath looked upon the humbling of his handmaid; for lo! from the present time, all the generations, will pronounce me happy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because he that is mighty hath done for me great things, and, holy, is his name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy is unto generations and generations, to them who revere him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He hath wrought strength with his arm, He hath scattered men arrogant in the intention of their heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He hath deposed potentates from thrones, and uplifted the lowly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The hungry, hath he filled with good things, and, the wealthy, hath he sent empty away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He hath laid hold of Israel his servant, to be mindful of mercies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>According as he spake unto our fathers,To Abraham, and to his seed,Unto times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And, to Elizabeth, was the time fulfilled, that she should be bringing forth,and she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard, that the Lord had magnified his mercy with her, and they were rejoicing with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it came to pass, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child, and were calling it, after the name of its father, Zachariah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother, answering, saidNay! but he shall be called, John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said unto herThere is, no one from among thy kindred, who is called by this name!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they began making signs unto his father, as to what he might be wishing it to be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And, asking for a small tablet, he wrote, sayingJohn, is his name! and they marvelled all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And his mouth was opened instantly, and his tongue   , and he began to speak, blessing, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came upon all the neighbours themselves; and, throughout all the hill-country of Judaea, were all these matters being much talked of;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>and all who heard laid</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And, Zachariah his father, was filled with Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed, be the Lord, the God of Israel! Because he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us, In the house of David his servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>According as he hath spoken by mouth of his holy ancient prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Of salvation from among our foes, and out of the hand of all them that hate us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>To perform mercy with our fathers, and to be mindful of his holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father, To grant us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>without fear, from the hand of enemies rescued, to be rendering divine service unto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in lovingkindness and righteousness before him, all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And, even thou, child, prophet of the Most High, shalt be called,for thou shall march on before the Lord, to prepare his ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>Giving a knowledge of salvation unto his people, by a remission of their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Because of the yearning compassion of the mercy of our God, wherein shall visit us a day-dawn from on high,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>To shine on them who, in the darkness and shade of death, are sitting, to guide our feet into a way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And, the child, went on growing, and being strengthened in spirit, and was in the deserts, until the day he was pointed out unto Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
