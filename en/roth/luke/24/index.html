And they came to a stand, sad in countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But one, by name Cleopas, answering, said unto himArt, thou, lodging, alone, in Jerusalem, and knowest not the things which have come to pass therein in these days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto themWhat things? And, they, said unto himThe things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who became a prophet, mighty in work and word, before God and all the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In what way also our High-priests and Rulers delivered him up unto a sentence of death, and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>We, however, were hoping that, he, was the one destined to redeem Israel! But indeed, even with all these things, this brings on, the third, day, since these things happened:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nay! certain women also, from amongst us, have made us beside ourselves, in that they went early unto the tomb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and, not finding his body, came, sayingthat, a vision of messengers, they had seen, who were affirming him to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And certain of them who were with us departed unto the tomb,and found so, according as, the women, had said; but, him, they saw not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, he, said unto themO thoughtless ones! and slow in heart to rest your faith upon all things which the prophets have spoken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Was it not needful for the Christ, these very things, to suffer, and to enter into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, beginning from Moses, and from all the prophets, he thoroughly explained to them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew near unto the village, whither they were journeying; and, he, made for journeying, further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they constrained him, sayingAbide with us; because it is, towards evening, and the day hath already declined. And he went in to abide with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, when he reclined with them, taking the loaf, he blessed, and, breaking it, went on to give unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, their, eyes were opened, and they knew him; and, he, vanished from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said one to anotherWas not, our heart, burning, as he was speaking to us in the way, as he was opening to us the Scriptures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, arising in that very hour, they returned unto Jerusalem,and found, gathered together, the eleven, and them who were with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>sayingIn truth, the Lord hath arisen, and hath appeared unto Simon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, they, went on to relate the things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now, as, these very things, they were telling, he himself, stood in their midst</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, being agitated and becoming, afraid, they began to imagine, that, upon a spirit, they were looking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said unto themWhy are ye troubled? and for what cause do reasonings arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See my hands, and my feet,that it is, I, myself: Handle me, and see! because, a spirit, hath not, flesh and bones, as ye perceive, I, have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>fehlt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now, while yet they believed not for the joy, and were marvelling, he said unto themHave ye anything to eat, here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave unto him a piece of boiled fish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and, taking it before them, he did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said unto themThese, are my words, which I spake unto you yet being with you: That all the things that are written in the law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms, concerning me, must needs be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then, opened he their mind, to understand the Scriptures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said unto themThus, it is written, That the Christ, should suffer, and arise from among the dead on the third day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that repentance for remission of sins should be proclaimed upon his name unto all the nations,beginning from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Ye, are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And lo! I, am sending forth the promise of my Father upon you; but tarry, ye, in the city, until ye be clothed, from on high, with power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he led them forth as far as unto Bethany; and, uplifting his hands, he blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, while he was blessing them, he parted from them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And, they,   returned unto Jerusalem, with great joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
