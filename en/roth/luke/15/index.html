And, he, divided unto them the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, after not many days, the younger son, gathering all together, left home for a country far away, and, there, squandered his substance with riotous living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine throughout that country,and, he, began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went his way, and joined himself unto one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to be feeding swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he used to long to be filled with the pods which the swine were eating; and, no man, was giving unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But coming, to himself, he saidHow many hired servants of my father, have bread enough and to spare, whereas, I, with famine, here, am perishing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise, and go unto my father, and will say unto himFather! I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>No longer, am I worthy to be called a son of thine,Make me as one of thy hired servants.

I have sinned against heaven, and before thee: No longer, am I worthy to be called a son of thine, make me as one of thy hired servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said unto his servantsQuick! bring forth a robethe best! and put on him, and get out a ring for his hand, and sandals for his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And be bringing the fatted calf, sacrifice! and let us eat and make merry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because, this my son, was, dead, and hath come to life again, was lost, and is found. And they began to be making merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But his elder son was in a field; and, as, in coming, he drew near unto the house, he heard music and dancing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and, calling near one of the youths, he inquired what these things, could be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, he, said unto him,Thy brother, hath come, and thy father hath sacrificed the fatted calf, because, safe and sound, hath he received him back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was provoked to anger, and would not go in.
