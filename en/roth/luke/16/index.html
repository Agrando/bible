Render the account of thy stewardship, for thou canst no longer be steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the steward said within himselfWhat shall I do, because my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? Dig, I cannot: to beg, I am ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what I will do, that, when I am removed out of the stewardship, they may welcome me into their own houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, calling unto him each one of the debtors of his own lord, he was saying unto the first,How much owest thou my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, he, saidA hundred baths of oil. And, he, said unto himKindly take thine accounts, and, sitting down, make haste and writeFifty!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After that, unto another, he saidAnd how much owest, thou? And, he, saidA hundred homers of wheat. He saith unto himKindly take thine accounts, and writeEighty!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the lord praised the unrighteous steward, in that with forethought he acted:Because, the sons of this age, have more forethought than the sons of light, respecting their own generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, I, unto you, sayFor yourselves, make ye friends, with the unjust Riches, in order that, as soon as it shall fail, they may welcome you into the age-abiding tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The faithful in least, in much also, is, faithful, and, he that in least is unrighteous, in much also, is, unrighteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore, in the unjust Riches ye proved unfaithful, the true, who, unto you, will entrust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, if, in what was anothers, ye proved unfaithful, your own, who will give unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No domestic, can, unto two masters, be in service; for either, the one, he will hate, and, the other, love, or, unto the one, he will hold, and, the other, despise: Ye cannot, unto God, be in service, and unto Riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the Pharisees, who were, lovers of money, were hearing all these things, and were openly sneering at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto themYe, are they who justify themselves before men, but, God, knoweth your hearts; because, that which amongst men is lofty, is an abomination before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets, were until John,from that time, the good news of the kingdom of God, is being proclaimed, and, everyone, thereinto, is forcing his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But it is, easier, for heaven and earth to pass away, than that, of the law, one little point, should fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one divorcing his wife and marrying another, committeth adultery; and, he that marrieth a woman divorced from a husband, committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, a certain man, was rich, and he used to clothe himself with purple and fine linen, making merry day by day, brilliantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, a certain beggar, by name Lazarus, used to be cast near his gate, full of sores,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and to long to be fed from the crumbs that fell from the table of the rich man: nay! even, the dogs, used to come and lick his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried away by the messengers, into the bosom of Abraham. And, the rich man also, died, and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, in hades, lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, he, calling out, saidFather Abraham! have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue,because I am in anguish in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham saidChild! rememberThat thou didst duly received thy good things in thy life, and, Lazarus, in like manner, the evil things; but, now, here, he is comforted, and, thou, art in anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, besides all these things, betwixt us and you, a great chasm, hath been fixed,so that, they who might wish to cross over from hence unto you, should not be able, nor any, from thence unto us, be crossing over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he saidI request thee then, father, that thou wouldst send him unto my fathers house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I have five brethren;that he may solemnly testify unto them, lest, they also, come into this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Abraham saithThey have Moses and the Prophets: Let them hearken unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, he, saidNay! father Abraham, but, if one, from the dead, should go unto them, they would repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he said unto himIf, unto Moses and the Prophets, they do not hearken, neither, if one, from among the dead, should arise, would they be persuaded.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
