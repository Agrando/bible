heal, thyself,Whatsoever things we have heard of coming to pass in Capernaum, do here also, in thine own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he saidVerily, I say unto you, No prophet, is, welcome, in his own country,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, of a truth, I say unto youMany widows, were in the days of Elijah, in Israel, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine upon all the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, unto none of them, was Elijah sent, save unto Sarepta of Sidonia, unto a woman that was a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, many lepers, were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet, and, not one of them, was cleansed, save Naaman the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all were filled with wrath, in the synagogue, as they heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, rising up, they thrust him forth outside the city, and led him as far as a brow of the hill on which their city was built,so that they might throw him down headlong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came down into Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they were being struck with astonishment at his teaching, because, with authority, was his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, in the synagogue, was a man having a spirit of an impure demon; and he cried out with a loud voice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let be! What have we in common with thee, O Jesus, Nazarene! Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art,The Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked it, sayingHold thy peace! and go forth from him. And the demon, throwing him into the midst, went forth from him, doing him no hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And amazement came upon all, and they began to converse one with another, sayingWhat is this word, that, with authority and power, he giveth orders unto the impure spirits, and they go forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And a noise concerning him began to go out into every place of the country around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, rising up, from the synagogue, he went into the house of Simon. Now, the mother-in-law of Simon, was in distress with a great fever; and they made request to him concerning her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her; and, instantly arising, she began to minister unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But, as the sun was going in, they one and all, as many as had any sick with divers diseases, brought them unto him; and, he, upon each one of them laying, his hands, was curing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And demons also were going forth from many; crying aloud, and sayingThou, art the Son of God. And, rebuking them, he suffered them not be talking; because they knew him to be, The Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, when it was day, going forth, he journeyed into a desert place; and, the multitudes, were seeking after him, and they came unto him, and would have detained him, that he might not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But, he, said unto themTo the other cities also, I must needs tell the good-news of the kingdom of God, because, hereunto, was I sent forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he was proclaiming in the cities of Judaea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
