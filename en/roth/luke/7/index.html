But, he, by this time, being not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying unto himLord! do not trouble thyself, for I am of no consideration, that, under my roof, thou shouldst enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore, neither deemed I, myself, worthy to come unto thee,but speak with a word, and let my servant be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For, I too, am a man ranked, under authority, having, under myself, soldiers; and I say to this oneGo! and he goeth,and to anotherCome! and he cometh,and to my servantDo this! and he doeth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, hearing these things, Jesus marvelled at him; and, turning to the multitude following him, saidI tell you, Not even in Israel, such faith as this, have I found!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they who were sent, returning unto the house, found the servant, well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass thereafter, that he journeyed unto a city called Nain, and there were journeying with him, his disciples and a great multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now, as he drew near unto the gate of the city, then lo! there was being brought forth, one dead, the only-begotten son of his mother,and, she, was a widow; and, a considerable multitude of the city, was with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, beholding her, the Lord, was moved with compassion over her, and said to herBe not weeping!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, going forward, he touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still; and he saidYoung man! to thee, I say, Arise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the dead man sat up, and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fear seized them, all, and they began to glorify God, sayingA great prophet, hath been raised up amongst us! andGod hath visited his people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this report went forth throughout the whole of Judaea, and all the surrounding country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Johns disciples carried tidings unto him concerning all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, calling unto him certain two of his disciples, John sent unto the Lord, sayingArt, thou, the Coming One, or, a different one, are we to expect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, coming near unto him, the men saidJohn the Immerser, hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art, thou, the Coming One, or, another, are we to expect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that very hour, he cured many from diseases, and plagues, and wicked spirits; and, unto many blind, gave he the favour to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, answering, he said unto themGo and bear tidings unto John, as to what ye have seen and heard: The blind, are receiving sight, the lame, walk, lepers, are cleansed, and, the deaf, hear, the dead, are raised, the destitute, are told the glad-message;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, happy, is he, whosoever shall not find occasion of stumbling in me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, the messengers having departed, he began to say unto the multitudes, concerning JohnWhat went ye forth into the desert to gaze at? A reed, by a wind, shaken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what went ye forth to see? A man, in soft garments, arrayed? Lo! they who in splendid apparel and luxury are found, are, in the kingly courts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what went ye forth to see? A prophet? Yea! I say unto you,and abundantly more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This, is he concerning whom it is writtenLo! I am sending forth my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I say unto youA greater, among them that are born of women, than John, is there none; but, he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, all the people, when they heard, and the tax-collectors, justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but, the Pharisees and the lawyers, had set aside, the counsel of God against themselves, not being immersed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Unto what, then, shall I liken the men of this generation? And unto what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like unto the children sitting, in a market-place, and calling one to another, who sayWe played the flute for you, and ye danced not, We wailed, and ye wept not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Immerser hath come, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye sayA demon, he hath:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of Man hath come, eating and drinking, and ye sayLo! a man, gluttonous and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And yet wisdom hath been justified by all her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And a certain one of the Pharisees was requesting him, that he would eat with him; and, entering into the house of the Pharisee, he reclined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, 1o! a woman, who indeed was in the city a sinner; and, when she found out that he was reclining in the house of the Pharisee, providing an alabaster-jar of perfume,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and standing behind, near his feet, weeping, with the tears, began she to be wetting his feet, and, with the hair of her head, was wiping off   , and was tenderly kissing his feet, and anointing them with the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spake within himself, saying, This one, if he were the prophet, would have been taking note, who and of what sort, is the woman, who is even touching him, that she is, a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And, making answer, Jesus said unto himSimon! I have, unto thee, something to say. He, thenTeacher, speak!saith he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two debtors, there were, to a certain creditor,the one, owed five hundred denaries, and, the other, fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>they not having wherewith to pay, he forgave, both. Which of them, therefore, will love him, more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Making answer, Simon saidI suppose, that he to whom, the more, he forgave. And, he, said unto himRightly, hast thou judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, turning towards the woman, unto Simon, he saidSeest thou this woman? I entered into thy house: water to me, on my feet, thou didst not give,but, she, with her tears, hath wetted my feet, and, with her hair, wiped off   .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A kiss, to me, thou didst not give,but, she, from the time I came in, hath not ceased tenderly kissing my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>With oil, my head, thou didst not anoint,but, she, with perfume, hath anointed, my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For which cause, I say unto theeHer many sins, have been forgiven, because she hath loved, much: but, he to whom little is forgiven, little, loveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said unto herThy sins have been forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they who were reclining together, began to be saying within themselvesWho is, this, that, even forgiveth sins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But he said unto the womanThy faith, hath saved thee,Go thy way into peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
