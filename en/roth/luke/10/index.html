Lo! I send you forth as lambs amid wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Be not carrying purse, or satchel, or sandals, and, no one along the road, salute ye;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, into whatsoever house ye enter, First, say, Peace to this house!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, if the son of peace be, there, your peace, shall rest upon it; but, otherwise, at least, unto you, shall it return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, in the self-same house, abide ye, eating and drinking such things as they have; for, worthy, is the labourer, of his hire: be not removing from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they bid you welcome, be eating such things as are set before you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And be curing the sick that are, therein, and be saying unto themThe kingdom of God hath drawn nigh upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they do not welcome you, going forth into the broadways thereof, say ye:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even the dust that cleaveth unto us, out of your city, unto our feet, do we wipe off against you; nevertheless, of this, be taking noticeThe kingdom of God hath drawn near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I tell you, for them of Sodom, in that day, more tolerable, will it be, than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! Because, if, in Tyre and Zidon, had been done the works of power which have been down in you, of old, in sackcloth and ashes sitting, they would have repented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover, for Tyre and Zidon, more tolerable, will it be, in the judgment, than, for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, thou, Capernaum,Unto heaven, shalt thou be uplifted? Unto hades, thou shalt be brought down!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that hearkeneth unto you, unto me, doth hearken, and, he that setteth you aside, doth set, me, aside; and, he that setteth, me, aside, doth set aside, him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventy  -two  returned, with joy, sayingLord! even the demons, submit themselves unto us, in thy name!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said unto themI was beholding Satan, when, like lightning, out of heaven, he fell!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lo! I have given you the authorityto be treading upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and, nothing, unto you, shall in anywise do harm;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Notwithstanding, in this, be not rejoicingthat, the spirits, unto you submit themselves; but be rejoicingthat, your names, are inscribed in the heavens!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the self-same hour, exulted he in the Holy Spirit, and saidI openly give praise unto thee, Father! Lord of heaven and earth! in that thou hast hid these things from the wise and discerning, and hast revealed them unto babes,Yea, O Father! that, so, hath it become, a delight, before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things, unto me, have been delivered up by my Father; and, no one, knoweth, who the Son is, save the Father,and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son may be minded to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, turning unto his disciples, privately, he saidHappy, the eyes, that see what ye see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you, Many prophets and kings, have desired to see what, ye, see, and they saw not, and to hear what ye hear, and they heard not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And lo! a certain lawyer, arose, putting him to the test, sayingTeacher! by doing what, shall I inherit, life age-abiding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, he, said unto himIn the law, what is written? how dost thou read?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, he, answering, saidThou shalt love the Lord thy God, out of all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, and with all thine intention; and thy neighbour, as thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said unto himRightly, hast thou answered: This, do, and thou shalt live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But, he, wishing to justify himself, said unto JesusAnd, who is, my, neighbour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And taking up   , Jesus saidA certain man, was going down from Jerusalem unto Jericho, and, with robbers, fell in,who, stripping him, and inflicting, wounds, upon him, departed, leaving him, half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, by chance, a certain priest, was coming down by that road, and, seeing him, passed by, on the opposite side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, in like manner, a Levite also, coming down to the place, and seeing him, passed by, on the opposite side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But, a certain Samaritan, going on his journey, came down to him, and, seeing him, was moved with compassion;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and, coming near, bound up his bruises, pouring thereon oil and wine,and, setting him on his own beast, brought him into an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, on the morrow, throwing out two denaries, he gave them to the inn-keeper, and saidTake care of him, and, whatsoever thou shall further spend, I, when on my way back, will duly pay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Which of these three, seemeth unto thee to have become, neighbour, unto him who fell among the robbers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, he, saidHe who dealt mercifully with him. And Jesus said unto himBe taking thy journey, and, thou, be doing, in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, as they were journeying, he, entered into a certain village; and, a certain woman, named Martha, welcomed him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, she, had a sister, called Mary, who also, seating herself at the feet of the Lord, was hearing his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But, Martha, was distracted about much ministering, and, coming near, saidLord! carest thou not that, my sister, hath left me to be ministering, alone? Speak to her, then, that she help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But the Lord, answering, said to herMartha! Martha! thou art anxious and troubled about many things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Of few things, is there need, or, of one; Mary, in fact, hath chosen, the good part,one which shall not be taken away from her.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
