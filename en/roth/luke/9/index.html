And he was seeking to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Apostles, returning, related to him what great things they had done. And, taking them aside, he retired privately, into a city called Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, the multitudes, getting to know, followed him; and, giving them welcome, he began speaking unto them concerning the kingdom of God,and, them that had need of cure, he healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, the day, began to decline; and the twelve, coming near, said to himDismiss the multitude, that, going into the surrounding villages and hamlets, they may lodge, and find provisions; because, here, in a desert place, are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said unto themGive, ye, them to eat. They, however, saidWe have not more than five loaves, and two fishes,unless perhaps, we, should go, and buy food, for all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For there were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciplesMake them recline, in companies of about fifty each.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they did so,and made, one and all, recline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, taking the five loaves, and the two fishes, looking up into heaven, he blessed them, and brake   up, and went on giving to the disciples, to set before the multitude;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they did all eat and were filled. And that which remained over to them, was taken up,of broken pieces, twelve baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, it came to pass, when he was praying in solitude, the disciples, were with him. And he questioned them, sayingWho do the multitudes say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they, answering, said John the Immerser; But some, Elijah, and others, that, some prophet of the ancients, hath arisen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to themBut who say, ye, that I am? And, Peter, answering, saidThe Christ of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He, however, sternly admonishing them, gave charge that, unto no one, should they be telling this;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>sayingThe Son of Man must needs suffer, many things, and be rejected by the Elders and High priests and Scribes, and be slain,and, on the third day, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he was saying, unto allIf any one intendeth after me to come, Let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily,and be following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, whosoever intendeth, his life, to save, shall lose it; but, whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same, shall save it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For what doth a man profit, who hath gained the whole world, but hath lost, or been made to forfeit, himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For, whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him, the Son of Man, will be ashamed, whensoever he shall come in his glory, and that of the Father, and of the holy messengers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I tell you of a truthThere, are, some of those, here, standing, who shall in nowise taste of death, until they see the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, after these words, about eight days, taking with him Peter and John and James, he went up into the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, while he was praying, that, the appearance of his face, was changed, and, his clothing, became white, effulgent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And lo! two men, were conversing with him, who, indeed, were Moses and Elijah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>who, appearing in glory, were speaking as to his departure, which he was about to fulfil in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, Peter, and they who were with him, had become heavy with sleep; but, waking up, they saw his glory, and the two men who were standing with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to pass, when they were being parted from him, Peter said unto JesusMaster! it is, delightful, for us to be, here: Let us, therefore, make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah:not knowing what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now, while he was saying these things, there came a cloud, and it began to overshadow them,and they were overcome with fear as they entered into the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And, a voice, came out of the cloud, sayingThis, is my Son, the Chosen One: Unto him, be hearkening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, when the voice came, there was found, Jesus alone. And they held their peace, and, unto no one, reported they, in those days, any of the things which they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that there met him a great multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And lo! a man from the multitude, uttered a cry, sayingTeacher! I beg of thee, to look upon my son, because, my only begotten, he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And lo! a spirit, taketh him, and, suddenly, he crieth out,and it convulseth himwith foaming, and with difficulty departeth from him, sorely bruising him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I begged of thy disciples, that they would cast it out, and they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, making answer, Jesus saidO faithless and perverted generation! how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring, hither, thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, while yet he was coming, the demon tare him, and mangled him. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were all being struck with astonishment, at the majesty of God. And, while all were marvelling at all things which he was doing, he said unto his disciples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Lay, ye, up in your ears, these words; for, the Son of Man, is about to be delivered up, into the hands of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But, they, understood not this saying, and it had become veiled from them, that they might not grasp it,and they were afraid to question him, concerning this saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But there entered a reasoning among them, as to who of them should be greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their heart, taking a child, placed it near himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and said unto themWhosoever shall give welcome unto this child, on my name, unto me, giveth welcome; and, whosoever, unto me, giveth welcome, giveth welcome unto him that sent me forth. For, he who is least among you all, the same, is, great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But John, answering, saidMaster! we saw some one, in thy name, casting out demons,and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said unto himDo not forbid; for, whosoever is not against you, is, for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, when the days for taking him up were on the point of being fulfilled, even he himself, set, his face, to be journeying unto Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and he sent messengers before his face,and, taking their journey, they entered into a village of Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they welcomed him not, because, his face, was for journeying unto Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the disciples James and John, seeing it, saidLord! wilt thou, that we bid fire come down from heaven, and destroy them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But, turning, he rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they journeyed into a different village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And, as they were journeying on the road, one said unto himI will follow thee, whithersoever thou shalt depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Jesus said unto himthe foxes, have, dens, and, the birds of heaven, nests; but, the Son of Man, hath not where, his head, he may recline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And he said unto anotherBe following me! But, he, saidSuffer me, first, to depart, and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he said unto himLeave, the dead, to bury their own dead; but, thou, departing, be declaring the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And, yet another, saidI will follow thee, Lord; But, first, suffer me to bid adieu to them that are in my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>But Jesus said</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
