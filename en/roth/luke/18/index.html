I thank thee, that I am not like the rest of men,extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or, even as this tax-collector;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice in the week, I give a tenth of whatsoever things I gain!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But, the tax-collector, afar off, standing,would not so much as lift up, his eyes, unto heaven, but kept smiting his own breast sayingO God! be propitiated unto me, the sinner!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell youThis one went down justified, unto his house, rather than that one; because, every one who exalteth himself, shall be abased, but, he that abaseth himself, shall be exalted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they were bringing unto him, even the babes, that he might touch, them; but the disciples, seeing it, began to rebuke them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, Jesus, called them near, sayingSuffer, the children, to be coming unto me, and do not hinder them; for, of such, is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Verily I say unto youWhosoever shall not welcome the kingdom of God, as a child, in nowise shall enter thereinto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain, ruler, questioned him, sayingGood Teacher! by doing what, shall I inherit life age-abiding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jesus said to himWhy, callest thou me, good? None, is good, save oneGod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The commandments, thou knowest:Do not commit adultery, Do not commit murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness,Honour thy father and mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, he, saidAll these things, have I kept from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus, hearing, said unto himYet one thing, unto thee, is lacking: Whatsoever thou hast, sell, and distribute unto the destitute,and thou shalt have treasure in  the  heavens; and come! be following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, he, hearing these things, became, encompassed with grief; for he was rich exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus, beholding him, saidWith what difficulty, shall, they who have money, enter, into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is, easier, for a camel, to enter, through the eye of a needle, than for, a rich man, to enter, into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they who heard saidWho, then, can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, he, saidThe things impossible with men, are, possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter saidLo! we, have left our own possessions, and followed thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, he, said unto themVerily, I say unto youNo one, is there, who hath lefthouse, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children,for the sake of the kingdom of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall in anywise not receive manifold in this season, and, in the age that is coming, life age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, taking aside the twelve, he said unto themLo! we are going up unto Jerusalem, and all the things will be finished, which have been written through means of the prophets, respecting the Son of Man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he will be delivered up unto the nations, and be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and, having scourged him, they will slay him, and, on the third day, will, he, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, they, not one of these things, understood, and this saying was hidden from them, and the could not comprehend the things spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, as he was drawing near unto Jericho, a certain blind man, was sitting beside the road, begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And. hearkening unto a multitude moving along, he enquired, what this, might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they told himJesus of Nazareth, is passing by!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried aloud, sayingJesus, son of David! have mercy upon me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, they that were going before, began to rebuke him, that he might hold his peace. But, he, by so much the more, was crying outO Son of David! have mercy upon me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And, standing still, Jesus commanded him to be led unto him; and, when he had drawn near, he questioned him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>What desirest thou, I should do unto thee? And, he, saidLord! that I may recover sight!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, Jesus, said unto himRecover sight! Thy faith, hath saved thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And, instantly, he recovered sight, and began to follow him, glorifying God. And, all the people, beholding, gave praise unto God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
