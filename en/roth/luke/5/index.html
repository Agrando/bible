Because, a sinful man, am I, O Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, amazement, overcame him, and all them who were with him, on account of the draught of the fishes which they had taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>likewise also, both James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto SimonDo not fear! henceforth, shall thou be taking, men, that they may, live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, bringing the boats down on to the land, they left all, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, that lo! there was a man full of leprosy; and, seeing Jesus, he fell on his face, and entreated him, sayingLord! if thou be willing, thou canst cleanse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, stretching forth the hand, he touched him, sayingI am willing: Be cleansed! And, straightway, the leprosy departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, he, charged him to tell, no one,but, departing, Show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses enjoined, for a witness unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the report concerning him the more went abroad, and many multitudes were coming together, to hear, and be getting cured from their infirmities;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>howbeit, he, was retiring in the deserts, and engaging in prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, on one of the days, that, he, was teaching, and there were sitting Pharisees and Teachers of the law, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem; and, the power of the Lord, was there, that he might heal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And lo! men bearing, upon a couch, one who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in, and lay him before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, not finding by what means they might bring him in, because of the multitude, going up on the house-top, through the tiling, let they him down, with the little-couch, into the midst before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, beholding their faith, he saidO man! thy sins are forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, sayingWho is this that speaketh profanities? Who can forgive, sins, save, God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus, taking note of their reasonings, answering, said unto themWhy are ye reasoning in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, To sayThy sins are forgiven thee; or to sayArise and be walking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, that ye may know that, the Son of Man, hath, authority, upon the earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralyzed manTo thee, I say, Arise, and, taking up thy couch, be going thy way unto thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, instantly arising before them, he took up that whereon he had been lying, and departed unto his house, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, astonishment, seized one and all, and they began glorifying God, and were filled with fear, sayingWe have seen unaccountable things, to-day!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, after these things, he went forth, and looked upon a tax-collector, by name Levi,presiding over the tax-office; and he said to himBe following me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, forsaking all, he arose, and was following him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made a great reception for him, in his house, and there was a great multitude of tax-collectors, and others,who were with them reclining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Pharisees and their Scribes began murmuring unto his disciples, sayingWherefore, with the tax-collectors and sinners, are ye eating and drinking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, answering, Jesus said unto themNo need, have, the whole, of a physician, but, they who are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I have not come to call, righteous, men, but, sinners, unto repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But, they, said unto himThe disciples of John, do fast much, and, supplications, do make,likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees; but, thine, do eat and drink!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus, however, said unto themCan, ye make, the sons of the bridechamber, fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But there will come days, even when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, then, will they fast, in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Moreover, he went on to speak, a parable also, unto themNo one, rending a patch from a new mantle, patcheth it upon an old mantle; otherwise, at least, both, the new, he will rend, and, with the old, the patch which is from the new, will not agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, no one, poureth new wine into old skins; otherwise, at least, the new wine, will burst the skins, and will, itself, be poured out, and the skins be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But, new wine, into unused skins, must be poured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>No one, having drunk old, desireth new; for he saith, The old, is, mellow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
