On the contrarythe greater among you, Let him become as, the younger, and, he that governeth, as, he that ministereth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For which is greaterhe that reclineth? or he that ministereth?

And, they, saidOf nothing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said unto themBut, now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, in like manner also, a satchel; and, he that hath nothing, let him sell his mantle, and buy a sword!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say unto youThis that is written, must needs be completed in me,And, with lawless ones, was he reckoned; for, even that which concerneth me, hath, completion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, they, saidLord, lo! two swords, here! And, he, said unto themTis, enough!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going out, he went, according to his custom, unto the Mount of Olives; and the disciples  also  followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And, coming up to the place, he said unto themBe praying, lest ye enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, he, was torn from them about a stones throw; and, bending his knees, he began to pray,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>sayingFather! if thou please, bear aside this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>fehlt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>fehlt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, arising from prayer, he came unto his disciples, and found them falling asleep by reason of their grief;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and he said unto themWhy are ye slumbering? Arise! and be praying, lest ye enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While yet he was speaking, lo! a multitude; and, he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them on,and he drew near unto Jesus, to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But, Jesus, said to himJudas! with a kiss, the Son of Man, dost thou deliver up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they who were about him, seeing what would be, saidLord! shall we smite with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And a certain one from among them smote, the High-priests, servant, and took off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus, answering, saidLet beas long as this! And, touching the ear, he healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said unto the High-priests, and Captains of the temple, and Elders, who had come against himAs against a robber, have ye come out, with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Daily, was I with you, in the temple, and yet ye stretched not forth your hands against me! But, this, is your hour, and the authority of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And, having arrested him, they led him away, and took him into the house of the High-priest; and, Peter, was following afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And, they having kindled up a fire in the midst of the court, and taken seats together, Peter was for sitting among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But, a certain maid-servant, seeing him seating himself towards the light, and looking steadfastly at him, saidThis one also, was, with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But, he, denied, sayingI know him not, woman!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And, after a little, another, beholding him, saidThou also, art, from among them. But, Peter, saidMan! I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And, about one hour having passed, a certain other, began stoutly to insist, sayingOf a truth, this one also, was with him; for indeed he is, a Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter saidMan! I know not what thou art saying! And, instantly while yet he was speaking, a cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned, and looked at Peter; and Peter was put in mind of the declaration of the Lord, how he had said to himBefore, a cock, crow this day, thou wilt deny me thrice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And, going forth outside, he wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And, the men who held him bound, kept mocking him, with blows;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and, blindfolding him, questioned him, sayingProphesy! which is he that smote thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>and, many other things, with profane speech, were they saying unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And, when it became day, the Eldership of the people was gathered togetherboth High-priests and Scribes,and they led him away into their high-council, sayingIf, thou, art the Christ, tell us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>But he said unto themIf I should tell, you, in nowise would ye believe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And, if I should put questions, in nowise would ye answer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But, henceforth, shall the Son of Man be seated on the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And they all saidThou, then, art the Son of God? And, he, unto them saidYe, say   ,because, I, am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And, they, saidWhat, further, need have we, of witness? We ourselves, have heard it from his mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
