These things, saying, he went on to cry aloudHe that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But his disciples began to question himWhat might, this very, parable be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, he, saidUnto you, hath it been given, to get to know the sacred secrets of the kingdom of God; but, unto the rest, in parables,in order that, seeing, they may not see, and, hearing, they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now the parable, is thisThe seed, is, the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, those beside the pathway, are they who have heard; afterwards, cometh the adversary, and catcheth away the word from their heart, lest, believing, they should, be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, those upon the rock, are they who, as soon as they hear, with joy, welcome the word; and, these, not having, root, are they who, for a season, believe,and, in a season of testing, draw back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, that which in among the thorns fell, these, are they who have heard; and, by anxieties and wealth and pleasures of life being borne along, are choked up, and bear not to perfection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, that in the good ground, these, are they who, indeed, in a noble and good heart having heard the word, hold fast, and bear fruit with endurance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, no one having lit a lamp, covereth it up with a vessel, or, beneath a couch, putteth it; but, upon a lamp-stand, putteth it, that, they who come in, may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For there is no secret, which shall not be made, manifest; neither a hidden thing, which shall in anywise not be made known, or not come, where it can be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Be taking heed therefore how ye hear; for, whosoever shall have, it shall be given unto him; and, whosoever shall not have, even what he seemeth to have, shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And his mother and brethren came near unto him, and were unable to reach him, because of the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it was reported to himThy mother and thy brethren, are standing outside, desiring, to see, thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, he, answering, said unto themMy mother and my brethren, are, thesethey who, the word of God, are hearing and doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, on one of the days, that, he, entered into a boat, and his disciples; and he said unto themLet us pass over unto the other side of the lake. And they set sail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And there came down a hurricane of wind upon the lake, and they began to be filled, and to be in peril.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, coming near, they roused him up, sayingMaster! Master! we perish! And, he, roused up, rebuked the wind, and the surging of the water; and they ceased, and it became a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said unto themWhere was your faith? But, struck with fear, they marvelled, saying one to anotherWho then is, this,that, even unto the winds, he giveth orders, and unto the water, and they hearken unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they sailed down into the country of the Gerasenes, the which is over against Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, when he went forth upon the land, there met him a certain man, out of the city, having demons; and, for a considerable time, he had put on no garment, and, in a house, would not abide, but among the tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, seeing Jesus, he cried out aloud, and fell down before him, and, with a loud voice, saidWhat have I in common with thee, O Jesus, Son of  God  the Most High? I beg of theeDo not torment me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he was about to charge the impure spirit to come out from the man. For, many times, had it snatched him away; and he used to be bound with chains and fetters, for a safe-guard, and was wont to break in pieces the bonds, and to be driven by the demon into the deserts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus questioned himWhat name hast thou? And, he, saidLegion! because many demons had entered into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they were beseeching him that he would not order them, into the abyss, to depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now there was there, a herd of a good many swine, feeding in the mountain; and they besought him, that he would suffer them, into those, to enter; and he suffered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the demons, going forth from the man entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down the cliff, into the lake, and were choked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they who had been feeding them, seeing what had happened, fled, and carried tidings into the city, and into the country-places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they went forth to see what had happened; and came unto Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone forth, sitting, clothed, and of sound mind, near the feet of Jesus,and they were struck with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they who had seen it, reported unto them, how the demonized man was saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And one and all of the throng of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes, requested him, to depart from them; because, with a great fear, were they oppressed. And, he, entering into a boat, returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the man from whom the demons had gone forth, began to beg of him, that he might be with him; but he dismissed him, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Be returning unto thy house, and telling forth what great things, God, for thee, hath done. And he departed, through all the city, proclaiming what great things, Jesus, had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now, when Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him back, for they were all expecting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And lo! there came a man, whose name was Jairus, and, the same, was, a ruler of the synagogue,and, falling down near the feet of Jesus, he began beseeching him to enter into his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>because he had, an only-begotten daughter, about twelve years old, and, she, was dying. Now, as he withdrew, the multitudes, were hemming him in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And, a woman, with a flow of blood of twelve years standing, who indeed could, from no one, be cured,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>coming near behind, touched the fringe of his mantle; and, instantly, was stayed the flow of her blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus saidWho, is it that touched me? And, when all were denying, Peter saidMaster! the multitudes, are hemming thee in, and pressing along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But, Jesus, saidSome one touched me, for, I, took note of power, gone out from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, the woman seeing that she had not escaped notice, trembling, came, and, falling down before him, reported before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed instantly!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And, he, said to herDaughter! thy faith, hath saved thee: Go thy way into peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While yet he is speaking, there cometh one from the synagogue rulers, sayingThy daughter, is dead: No further, be troubling the teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But, Jesus, hearing, answered himDo not fear! Only believe, and she shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, when he came into the house, he suffered no one to enter with him, save Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl, and the mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they were all weeping, and beating themselves, for her. And he saidBe not weeping; for she died not, but is sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they were deriding him, knowing that she died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But, he, grasping her hand, called aloud, sayingO girl! arise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit returned, and she rose up instantly, and he ordered that something should be given her to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were beside themselves. But, he, charged them to tell, no one, what had happened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
