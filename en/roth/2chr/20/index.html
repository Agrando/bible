Thus, saith Yahweh unto you. As for you, do not fear nor be dismayed, by reason of this great multitude, for, not yours, is the battle, but, Gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To-morrow, go ye down against them, for lo! there they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz,and ye shall find them at the end of the ravine, facing the wilderness of Jeruel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is not, for you, to fight in this matter,take your station, stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh with you, O Judah and Jerusalem, do not fear, nor be dismayed, to-morrow, go ye out to meet them, and, Yahweh, will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehoshaphat bowed his head, with his face to the ground,and, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, fell down before Yahweh, prostrating themselves unto Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Levitesof the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites, stood up to offer praise unto Yahweh, God of Israel, with an exceedingly loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they rose early in the morning, and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa,and, as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, Trust ye in Yahweh your God, and ye shall be trusted, Trust ye in his prophets, and ye shall prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, when he had given counsel unto the people, he appointed such as should sing unto Yahweh, and offer praise with holy adorning,as they should be going forth before the armed men, that they should be saying, O give thanks unto Yahweh, For, age-abiding, is his lovingkindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, when they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh had set liers-in-wait against the sons of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, who were coming against Judah, and they were smitten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then rose up the sons of Ammon and Moab against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, to devote and to destroy,and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to cut off, every man his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when, Judah, came near the watch-tower of the wilderness,they turned towards the multitude, and lo! there they were, dead bodies fallen to the earth, with none to escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, when Jehoshaphat and his people came near to plunder the spoil of them, they found among them, in abundance, both riches and dead bodies and precious jewels, and they stripped off for themselves, beyond what they could carry away,and they were three days plundering the spoil, for great it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, on the fourth day, they assembled themselves in the vale of Beracah, for there they blessed Yahweh,on this account, was the name of that place called The Vale of Beracahunto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then turned every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with, Jehoshaphat, at their head, to go again to Jerusalem with joy,for Yahweh had caused them to rejoice over their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they came to Jerusalem, with harps and with lyres, and with trumpets,unto the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass that, the dread of God, was upon all the kingdoms of the countries,-when they heard, that Yahweh had fought against the enemies of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet,for his God, gave him rest, round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah,thirty-five years old, was he when he began to reign, and, twenty-five years, reigned he in Jerusalem, and the, name of his mother, was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and turned not from it,doing that which was right, in the eyes of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Howbeit, the high places, were not taken away,for as yet, the people, had not fixed their heart unto the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But, the rest of the story of Jehoshaphat, first and last, lo! there it is written in the story of Jehu son of Hanani, which hath been added to the book of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yet, after this, did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel,he, was lawless in his doings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he joined with him, to make ships to go unto Tarshish,and they made ships in Ezion-geber,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then prophesied, Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah, against Jehoshaphat, saying,Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, Yahweh hath broken in pieces thy works. So the ships were wrecked, and were not able to go unto Tarshish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
