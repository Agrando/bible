God of Israel, Not like unto thee, is there a god, in the heavens, or throughout the earth,who keepest Covenant and Lovingkindness for thy servants who are walking before thee with all their heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who hast kept, for thy servant David my father, that which thou didst promise him,in that thou didst promise with thy mouth, and, with thy hand, hast fulfilled, as   this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, therefore, O YahwehGod of Israel, keep thou, for thy servant David my father, that which thou didst promise him, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man, from before me, to sit upon the throne of Israel, if only, thy sons take heed to their way, to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, therefore, O Yahweh, God of Israel,-verified be thy promise, which thou didst make unto thy servant David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, in very deed, will God dwell with man on the earth? Lo! the heavens, even the leaven of heavens, cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have built!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wilt thou then turn unto the prayer of thy servant and unto his supplication, O Yahweh my God,to hearken unto the cry and unto the prayer, wherewith thy servant is praying before thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that thine eyes may be open toward this house, day and night, toward the place of which thou hast said thou wouldst set thy Name there,to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant may pray towards this

bring them back unto the soil, which thou didst give to them and to their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain, because they have been sinning against thee,and they shall pray towards this place, and shall confess thy Name, from their sin, shall return, because thou hast been afflicting them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then wilt, thou thyself, hear   the heavens and forgive the sin of thy servants, and thy people Israel, that thou mayest direct them into the good way, wherein they should walk,and give rain, upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people, for an inheritance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When there shall be, a famine, in the land, when there shall be, a pestilence,when there shall be, blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar,when their enemy shall besiege them in the land at their own gates-whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness;-</span> <span

so he shall spread abroad his hands towards this house</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>then wilt, thou thyself, hear out of the heavens, the settled place of thine abode, and forgive, and grant to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou wilt know,for, thou thyself alone, knowest the heart of the sons of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>to the end they may revere thee, to walk in thy ways, all the days which they shall be living upon the face of the soil,which thou gavest unto their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Moreover also, unto the stranger who is not, of thy people Israel, but he shall come in out of a far countryfor the sake of thy great Name, and of thy strong hand, and of thine outstretched arm,and so they shall come in and pray towards this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>then wilt, thou thyself, hear out of the heavens, out of the settled place of thine abode, and do according to all for which the stranger shall cry unto thee,to the end that all the peoples of the earth may know thy Name, so as to revere thee like thy people Israel, and know that, thy Name, hath been given unto this house, which I have built?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies, whithersoever thou mayest send them,and shall pray unto thee in the direction of this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy Name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>then wilt thou hear, out of the heavens, their prayer and their supplication,and maintain their right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When they sin against theefor there is no son of earth who sinneth notand thou shalt be angry with them, and deliver them up before an enemy,who shall carry them away as their captives into a landfar away or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they come back to their right mind, in the land whither they have been taken captive,and so turn and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and been lawless;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and so turn unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive,and shall pray in the direction of their own land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and unto the house which I have built for thy Name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then wilt thou hear out of the heavensout of the settled place of thine abodetheir prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause,and forgive thy people, that wherein they sinned against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now, O my God, letI beseech theethine eyes be open, and thine ears attent,unto the prayer of this place.</span> <span

O Yahweh God, unto thy rest, thou, and the ark of thy strength: Thy priests, O Yahweh God, let them be clothed with salvation, and, thy men of lovingkindness, let them rejoice in prosperity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>O Yahweh God! do not turn away thy face from thine Anointed One,oh remember lovingkindness unto David thy servant.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
