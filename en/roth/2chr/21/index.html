Then, must Libnah needs revolt at the same time, from under his hand,because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He too, made high places among the mountains of Judah,and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unchaste, and seduced Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then came there unto him, a writing, from Elijah the prophet, saying,Thus, saith Yahweh, God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa, king of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unchaste, after the unchastities of the house of Ahab,moreover also, thine own brethren of the house of thy father who were better than thou, hast thou slain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>lo! Yahweh, is about to plague, with a great plague, thy people,-and thy children and thy wives, and all thy possessions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>also, thyself, with sore diseases, with disease of thy bowels,-until thy bowels shall fall out, by reason of the disease, in a year added to a year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and the Arabians, who were under the direction of the Ethiopians;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they came up against Judah, and forced their way into it, and carried off all the possessions that were found belonging to the house of the king, moreover also his sons and his wives,so that there was left him never a son, save only Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, after all this, Yahweh plagued him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, in a year beyond a year, even when the end of the days of two years had passed, that his bowels fell out by reason of his disease, so that he died, of, malignant disease,and his people made him no burning, like the burning of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thirty-two years old, was he when he began to reign, and, eight years, reigned he in Jerusalem,and went his wayunregretted, and, though they buried him in the city of David, yet, not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
