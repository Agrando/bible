Then said the man of God, Yahweh is able to give thee much more than this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Amaziah separated them,   unto the company which had come unto him out of Ephraim, to depart unto their own place,wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, so they returned to their own place, in a heat of anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, Amaziah, took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt,and smote of the sons of Seir, ten thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the sons of Judah took captive, ten thousand alive, and brought to the top of the crag,and cast them down from the top of the crag, and, all of them, were torn asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But, as for the sons of the company which Amaziah sent back from going with him to the war, they spread themselves out against the cities of Judah, from Samaria, even unto Beth-horon,and smote of them three thousand, and took great plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And so it was, after Amaziah came in from smiting the Edomites, that he brought in the gods of the sons of Seir, and set them up for himself, as gods,and, before them, used he to bow himself down, and, unto them, used he to burn a perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then was kindled the anger of Yahweh, against Amaziah,and he sent unto him a prophet, and said unto him, Wherefore hast thou sought the gods of the people, which delivered not their own people out of thy hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, as he spake unto him, that he said to him, To be, counselor to the king, have we appointed thee? forbear thou, wherefore should they smite thee? So the prophet forbare, and saidI know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel, and sent unto Joash, son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu king of Israel, saying,Come, let us look one another in the face!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joash king of Israel sent unto Amaziah king of Judah, saying, A thistle that was in Lebanon, sent unto a cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Come! give thy daughter unto my son to wife,but there passed by a beast of the field that was in Lebanon, and trampled down the thistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou hast said-Lo! thou hast smitten the Edomites, and thy heart hath lifted thee up to display honour,-Now, abide in thine own house, wherefore shouldst thou engage in strife with Misfortune, and fall, thou and Judah with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Amaziah hearkened not, because, from God, it was, to the end he might deliver them up into   hand,because they had sought the gods of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Joash king of Israel came up, and they looked one another in the face, he, and Amaziah king of Judah,in Beth-shemesh, which belongeth unto Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was Judah defeated, before Israel,and they fled every man to his own home;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and, Amaziah king of Judah, son of Joash son of Jehoahaz, was taken by Joash king of Israel, in Beth-shemesh,and he brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim as far as the corner-gate, four hundred cubits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and, all the gold and the silver and all the utensils that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the house of the king, and hostages, he took,-and returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived, after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel,fifteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now, the rest of the story of Amaziah, first and last, lo! it is written in the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, after the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh, they made against him a conspiracy in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish,but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they brought him on horses,-and buried him with his fathers, in the city of Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
