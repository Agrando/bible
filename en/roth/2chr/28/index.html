But is it not sothat, ye yourselves, are altogether guilty against Yahweh your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, therefore, hearken unto me, and restore the captives whom ye have taken captive from among your brethren,for, the glow of the anger of Yahweh, is over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then rose up certain of the chiefs of the sons of EphraimAzariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai,against them who were coming in from the army;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither, for, with guilt against Yahweh already upon us, ye, are thinking to add unto our sins, and unto our guilt,for great is the guilt we have, and fierce is the anger over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the armed men left the captives, and tile plunder, before the rulers, and all the convocation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then rose up the men who have been expressed by nameand took the captives, and, all who were naked among them, clothed they out of the spoil, and arrayed them and sandalled them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and conducted them with asses for every one that was exhausted, and brought them to Jericho the city of palm-trees, near unto their brethren,and then returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time, sent King Ahaz unto the kings of Assyria to help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For again had, the Edomites, come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and, the Philistines, had spread themselves out against the cities of the lowland and of the south, pertaining to Judah, and had captured Beth-shemesh and Aijalon and Gederoth, and Soco with its villages, and Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo, with its villages,and dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For Yahweh had brought Judah low, because of Ahaz king of Israel,for he had given the rein in Judah, and, been grievously unfaithful, with Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, came against him,and distressed him, but strengthened him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh, and out of the house of the king, and the rulers,and gave unto the king of Assyria, but he helped him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, in the time of his distress, he yet further acted unfaithfully with Yahweh,he, King Ahaz!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus who had smitten him, and said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria are helping them, unto them, will I sacrifice, that they may help me. But, they, served to seduce him and all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Ahaz gathered together the utensils of the house of God, and brake away the fittings of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh,and made for himself altars at every corner in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and, in every several city of Judah, made he high places, for burning incense unto other gods,and provoked Yahweh, God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, the rest of his story, and all his ways, first and last, there they are, written the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel,and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
