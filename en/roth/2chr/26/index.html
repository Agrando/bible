Go forth out of the sanctuary, for thou hast acted unfaithfully, and, not to thee, for an honour,   from Yahweh Elohim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then was Uzziah wroth, and, in his hand, was a censer, to burn incense,and, when he was wroth with the priests, a leprosy, shot forth in his forehead, before the priests, in the house of Yahweh, from off the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned towards him, lo! he, was leprous, in his forehead, so they hastened him from thence,yea, even he himself, hurried to go out, because Yahweh had smitten him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass that, Uzziah the king, was a leper until the day of his death, and dwelt in a house aparta leper, for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh,and, Jotham his son, was over the house of the king, judging the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now, the rest of the story of Uzziah, first and last, hath Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial that pertained unto the kings, for they said, A leper, he is. And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
