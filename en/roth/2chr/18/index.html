And he said unto himSo am I, even as thou, and, like thy people, are my people, and, with thee, in the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said Jehoshaphat, unto the king of Israel,Seek, I pray thee, some time to-day, the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the king of Israel gathered together the prophets, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go up against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they saidGo up, and may God deliver it into the hand of the king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then said Jehoshaphat, Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, besides,that we may seek, from him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said the king of Israel unto JehoshaphatThere is yet one man, by whom to seek Yahweh, but, I, hate him, for he is never prophesying, concerning me, anything goodbutall his daysevil, the same, is Micaiah, son of Imla. Then said Jehoshaphat, Let not the king say, so!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel called for a certain officer,and said, Haste, Micaiah son of Imla!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, were sitting, each upon his throne, clothed in robes, and they were sitting in an open space, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria,and, all the prophets, were prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then did Zedekiah son of Chenaanah make him horns of iron,and saidThus, saith Yahweh, With these, shalt thou push Syria, until they are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, all the prophets, were prophesying, so, saying,-Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper, and Yahweh will deliver   into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, the messenger who went to call Micaiah, spake unto him, saying, Lo! the words of the prophets, with one mouth, are good for the king,be thy word then, I pray thee, like one of theirs, so wilt thou speak good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said Micaiah,By the life of Yahweh, whatsoever my God shall say, that, must I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now, when he came unto the king, the king said unto him, Micah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up and prosper, and may they be delivered into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the king said unto him, How many times, must, I, be putting thee on oath,that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So he said, I saw all Israel, scattered upon the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd,-and Yahweh said, No masters, have these! let them return every man unto his own house, in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said the king of Israel, unto Jehoshaphat,Said I not unto thee, He wilt not prophesy concerning me anything good, but evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said he, Therefore, hear ye the word of Yahweh,I saw Yahweh, sitting upon his throne, and, all the host of the heavens, standing, on his right hand and his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said Yahweh, Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall in Ramoth-gilead? And one spake, saying after this manner, and another, saying after that manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came there forth a spirit and stood before Yahweh, and said, I, will persuade him. And Yahweh said unto him, Wherewith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, I will go forth and become a spirit of falsehood, in the mouth of all his prophets. And he saidThou mayest persuade, moreover also, thou shalt prevail, go forth, and do, so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now, therefore, lo! Yahweh hath suffered a spirit of falsehood to be put into the mouth of these thy prophets,but, Yahweh, hath spoken concerning theeevil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then drew near Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek,and said, Which then is the way the spirit of Yahweh passed from me, to speak with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Micaiah, Lo! thou shalt see, on that day when thou shalt enter into a chamber within a chamber, to hide thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said the king of Israel, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon ruler of the city, and unto Joash son of the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and ye shall say, Thus, saith the king, Put ye this one into the prison,and feed him with the bread of oppression, and with the water of oppression, until I return in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then said Micaiah, If thou do, at all return, in peace, Yahweh hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear! ye peoples, all!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then went up the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, against Ramothgilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,   to disguise myself, and enter into the battle, but, thou, put on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and entered into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now, the king of Syria, had commanded the captains of chariots which he had, saying, Ye shall not fight, with small   with great,save with the king of Israel, alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So it came to pass, when the chariot-captains saw Jehoshaphat, that, they, said, The king of Israel, it is. And they compassed him about, to fight,but Jehoshaphat made outcry, and, Yahweh, helped him, yea God allured them away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And so it came to pass, when the chariot-captains saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned hack from pursuing him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but, a certain man, drawing a bow in his innocence, smote the king of Israel between the shoulder-joints and the coat of mail,wherefore he said to the charioteer, Turn thy hand, and convey me out of the host, for I am sore wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the battle increased on that day, and, the king of Israel, was propping himself up in the chariot before the Syrians, until evening,-and died at the time of the going in of the sun.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
