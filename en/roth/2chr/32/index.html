And the people leaned upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants towards Jerusalem, himself, being near Lachish, and all his imperial might with him,unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that was in Jerusalem, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus, saith Sennacherib, king of Assyria,-Upon what, are, ye, trusting, that ye are awaiting the siege in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Is not, Hezekiah, persuading you, so as to deliver you up to die with hunger and with thirst, saying,Yahweh our God, will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is it not, the same Hezekiah, who hath removed his high places, and his altars,and hath given word to Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar, shall ye bow yourselves down, and, thereupon, shall ye burn incense?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Will ye not take note, what I have done, I and my fathers, to all the peoples of the countries? Have the gods of the nations of the countries been, at all able, to deliver their country, out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who, among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers devoted to destruction, hath ever been able to deliver his people out of my hand,that your god should be able to deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now, therefore, do not let Hezekiah beguile you nor persuade you thus, neither do ye believe him. For no, god, of any nation or kingdom hath ever been able to deliver his people out of my hand, or out of the hand of my fathers,-how much less shall, your gods, deliver you, out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, yet more, spake his servants, against Yahweh, God,and against Hezekiah his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Letters, also wrote he, to scoff at Yahweh God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, Like the gods of the nations of the countries, who delivered not their people out of my hand, so, shall the god of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then cried they out, with a loud voice, in the Jews language, unto the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall, to affright them, and to terrify them,to the end they might capture the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spake against the God of Jerusalem,as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of the hands of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Hezekiah the king and Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, prayed concerning this,-and made outcry unto the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Yahweh sent a messenger, who cut off every hero of valour, and chief ruler and captain, in the camp of the king of Assyria,and he returned with shame of face to his own land, and, when he entered the house of his god, then, the issue of his own bodythere, caused him to fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus did Yahweh save Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria, and out of the hand of every one,and gave them rest on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, many, were bringing in a present unto Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and precious things, unto Hezekiah king of Judah,so that he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations, from thenceforth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In those days, was Hezekiah sick unto death,and, when he prayed unto Yahweh, he was entreated of him and, a wonderful token, he gave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, not according to the benefit done unto him, did Hezekiah make return, for uplifted was his heart,and so there came upon him, wrath, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Hezekiah humbled himself, for the uplifting of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,so that the wrath of Yahweh came not upon them, in the days of Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass that, Hezekiah, had riches and honour in great abundance,and, treasuries, made he for himselffor silver and for gold and for costly stones, and for spices and for precious things, and for all utensils to be coveted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>storehouses also, for the increase of corn, and new wine and oil,and cribs for every kind of beast, and cribs for the flocks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and, cities, made he for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds, in abundance,for God had given him exceeding great wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, the same Hezekiah, stopped up the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down the west side of the city of David,and Hezekiah prospered in all his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet verily, with regard to the ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire concerning the wonderful token which came to pass in the land, God left him,to prove him, to take note of all that was in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But, the rest of the story of Hezekiah, and his lovingkindnesses, there they are, written in the visions of Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, in the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him, honour, in his death,and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
