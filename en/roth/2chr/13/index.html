Whosoever cometh to install himself with a young bullock, and seven rams, then becometh he a priest unto the, no-gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, as for us, Yahweh, is our God, and we have not forsaken him,and, the priests who are waiting upon Yahweh, are sons of Aaron, with Levites in the work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they are making a perfume unto Yahweh, with ascending-sacrifices morning by morning, and evening by evening and an incense of sweet spices, and are putting in order bread upon the pure table, and the lampstand of gold with the lamps thereof, for lighting up evening by evening, for, observant, are we of the charge of Yahweh our God,whereas, ye, have forsaken him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And lo! with us as Head, is God himself, and his priests, and the trumpets of alarm, to sound an alarm against you,O sons of Israel! do not fight against Yahweh God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But, Jeroboam, sent round an ambush, to come up from behind them,so they were before Judah and, the ambush, did come up from behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, when Judah turned and lo! as for them, the battle was before and behind, then made they outcry unto Yahweh,and, the priests, kept on blowing with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the men of Judah gave a shout,and it came to pass, when the men of Judah shouted, then, God himself, smote Jeroboam and all Israel, before Abijah and Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sons of Israel fled from before Judah,and God delivered them into their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abijah and his people smote among them with a great smiting,and there fell down slain, of Israel, five hundred thousand chosen men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus were the sons of Israel subdued at that time,and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they leaned upon Yahweh the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and captured from him, cities, even Bethel, with the villages thereof, and Jeshanah, with the villages thereof,and Ephron, with the villages thereof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>neither was Jeroboam strong any more, in the days of Abijah,and Yahweh smote him that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abijah strengthened himself, and took him, fourteen wives,and begat twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, the rest of the story of Abijah, both his ways and his words,are written, in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
