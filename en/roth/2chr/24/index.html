Then were they offering ascending-sacrifices in the house of Yahweh, continually, all the days of Jehoiada.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jehoiada waxed old and became satisfied with days, and died,a hundred and thirty years old, when he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they buried him in the city of David, with the kings,because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, after the death of Jehoiada, came the rulers of Judah, and bowed themselves down unto the king,then, hearkened the king unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they forsook the house of Yahweh, God of their fathers, and served the Sacred Stems, and the images,so there was wrath against Judah and Jerusalem, for this their guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he sent among them prophets, to bring them back unto Yahweh,and they testified against them, but they would not give ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, the spirit of God, clothed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and he took his stand above the people,and said unto them, Thus, saith God, Wherefore are, ye, transgressing the commandments of Yahweh, so that ye cannot prosper, because ye have forsaken Yahweh, therefore hath he forsaken you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones, by the commandment of the king,in the court of the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus Joash the king, remembered not, the lovingkindness which Jehoiada his father had done for him, but slew his son,and, as he died, he said, Yahweh see and require!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when the year had gone round, that the force of Syria came up against him, and they entered Judah, and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the rulers of the people, from among the people,and, all the spoil of them, sent they unto the king of Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Although, with a comparatively few men, came the force of Syria, yet, Yahweh, delivered into their hand an exceeding large force,because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers,and, upon Joash, executed they judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, when they had departed from him, for they left him with sore diseases, his own servants conspired against him, for the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him upon his bed, and he died,and, though they buried him in the city of David, yet did they not bury him in the sepulchres of the kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now, these, are they that conspired against him,Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, as for his sons, and the greatness of the oracle on him, and the foundation of the house of God, lo! there they are written, in the commentary of the Book of Kings,and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
