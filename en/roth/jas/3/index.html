Lo! how small a fire, kindleth, how great a forest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, the tongue, is a fire,  , the world of unrighteousness, the tongue, becometh fixed among our members, that which defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the wheel of our natural life, and is set on fire, by gehenna!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For, every natureboth of wild beasts and of birds, both of reptiles and of things in the sea, is to be tamed, and hath been tamed, by the human nature;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, the tongue, none of mankind can, tame,A restless mischief! Full of deadly poison</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therewith, are we blessing our Lord and Father, and, therewith, we are cursing the men who, after the likeness of God, have been brought into being!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth, come forth blessing and cursing! Not meet, my brethren, for, these things, thus, to be coming to pass!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Doth, the fountain, out of the same opening, teem forth the sweet and the bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is it possible, my brethren, for, a fig-tree, to produce, olives, or, a vine, figs? Neither can, salt, water yield, sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and well-instructed-among you? Let him show, out of his comely behaviour, his works, in meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, if, bitter jealousy, ye have, and rivalry, in your hearts; be not boasting and showing yourselves false against the truth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not one, from above, coming down, but is earthly, born of the soul, demoniacal!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, where jealousy and rivalry are, there, are anarchy and every ignoble deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, the wisdom from above, isfirst pure, then peaceable, reasonable, easy to be entreated, fraught with mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, in harvest of righteousness, with peace, is sown by them that make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
