Do not, the rich, oppress you? and, themselves, drag you into courts of justice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not, they, defame the noble name which hath been invoked upon you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If ye are, indeed, fulfilling, a royal law, according to the scriptureThou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, nobly, are ye doing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But, if ye are shewing respect of persons, sin, are ye working, being convicted by the law as transgressors!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, a man who shall keep, the whole law, but shall stumble in one thing, hath become, for all things, liable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, he that hath saidDo not commit adultery, hath also saidDo not commit murder,now, if thou dost not commit adultery, but dost commit murder, thou hast become a transgressor of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So, be speaking, and, so, doing, as they who, through means of a law of freedom, are about to be judged;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, the judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What profit, my brethren,if one should be saying he hath, faith, but hath not, works; can his faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If, a brother or sister, should be naked, and coming short of the daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And one from among you should say unto themWithdraw in peace, be getting warmed and fed, but should not give them the things needful for the body, What the profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So, also, faith, if it have not works, is dead, by itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But one will say,Thou, hast faith, and, I, have works, show me thy faith apart from thy works, and, I, unto thee, will shew, by my works, my faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou believest that God is, one: thou doest, wellEven the demons believe, and shudder!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But art thou willing to learn, O empty man! that, faith, apart from works, is, idle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Abraham our father, was it not, by works, he was declared righteouswhen he offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou seest that, his faith, had been working together with his works, and by his works did his faith become full-grown,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scripture was fulfilled which saithAnd Abraham believed God, And it was reckoned to him as righteousness, and, Gods friend, was he called:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye see thatby works, a man is declared righteous, and not by faith alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, in like manner also, Rahab the harlot, Was it not, by works, she was declared righteous, when she gave welcome unto the messengers, and, by another way, urged them forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Just as, the body, apart from spirit, is dead, so, our faith also, apart from works, is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
