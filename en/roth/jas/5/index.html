Weep ye, howling, for your hardships which are coming upon you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Your wealth, hath rotted, and, your garments, have become, moth-eaten,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Your gold and silver, have rusted away, and, their rust, shall be, witness against you, and shall eat your flesh, as fire! Ye have laid up treasure in days of extremity:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lo, the wage of the workers who have out down your fieldsthat which hath been kept back, by you, is crying out; and, the outcries of them who reaped, into the ears of the Lord of hosts, have entered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ye have luxuriated upon the land, and run riot, ye have pampered your hearts in a day of slaughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ye sentencedye murdered the Righteous one!

If one among you be led to err from the truth, and one turn him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Be ye taking notethat, he that turneth back a sinner out of the error of his waywill save his soul out of death, and hide a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
