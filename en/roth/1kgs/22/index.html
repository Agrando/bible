So the king of Israel gathered together the prophets, about four hundred men, and said unto themShall I go against Ramoth-gilead, to battle, or shall I forbear? And they saidGo up, that the Lord may deliver it into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Jehoshaphat, Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, besides,that we may seek, from him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Besides, is a certain man, by whom we might seek Yahweh, but, I, hate him, for he is never moved to prophesy concerning me anything good, only evil, Micaiah, son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king of Israel called a certain courtier,and said, Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now, the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, were sittingeach man upon his throne, having put on robes, in a level place, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria,and, all the prophets, were being moved to prophesy before them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>when Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron,and saidThus, saith Yahweh,With these, shalt thou push down the Syrians, until thou hast consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, all the prophets, were being moved to prophesy, in like manner, saying,Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and thou shelf prosper, and Yahweh will deliver it, into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, the messenger who went to call Micaiah, spake unto him, saying, Behold, I pray thee, the words of the prophets, with one mouth, are good, as touching the king, let thy word, I pray thee, be as the word of one of them, so wilt thou speak that which is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Micaiah said,By the life of Yahweh, what Yahweh saith unto me, that, will I, speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he came unto the king, and the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he said unto himGo up and prosper, and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king said unto him, How many times must, I, adjure thee,that thou speak unto me nothing but truth, in the name of Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he saidI saw all Israel, scattered among the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd,so Yahweh said, These have, no masters, let them return every man unto his own house, in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said the king of Israel, unto Jehoshaphat,Did I not say unto thee, He will not be moved to prophesy concerning me anything good, only calamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he said, Therefore, hear thou the word of Yahweh,I saw Yahweh, sitting upon his throne, and all the host of the heavens, standing by him, on his right hand, and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Yahweh said, Who will persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall, at Ramoth-gilead? And, one, said in this manner, and, another, said in that manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and saidI, will persuade him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Yahweh said unto himWherewith? And he saidI will go forth, and become a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets,So he said,Thou mayest persuade, yea and prevail, go forth, and do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, therefore, lo! Yahweh hath suffered a spirit of falsehood to be put into the mouth of all these thy prophets. But, Yahweh himself, hath spoken concerning thee, calamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then drew near Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, and smote Micaiah on the cheek,and saidWhere then passed the Spirit of Yahweh, from me, to speak unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said Micaiah, Lo! thou art about to see, on that day,when thou enterest a chamber within a chamber, to hide thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon captain of the city,and unto Joash son of the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and thou shalt sayThus, saith the king, Put this man into the prison,and let him eat the bread of oppression, with the water of oppression, until I enter in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said Micaiah, If thou, return, in peace, Yahweh hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the king of Israel went up, with Jehoshaphat king of Judah, unto Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king of Israel said unto JehoshaphatI am about to disguise myself, and enter into the battle, thou, therefore, put on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and entered into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now, the king of Syria, had commanded the captains of chariots which he had, thirty and two, saying, Ye shall not fight with small or great,save with the king of Israel alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass, when the chariot-captains saw Jehoshaphat, that, they, said: Surely it is, the king of Israel! But, when they turned aside against him to fight, Jehoshaphat cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to pass, when the chariot-captains saw that it was, not the king of Israel, that they turned back, from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But, a certain man, drawing a bow in his innocence, smote the king of Israel, between the shoulder-joints and the coat of mail,wherefore he said to his charioteerTurn thy hand, and convey me out of the host, for I am sore wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the battle increased that day, and, the king, was propped up in the chariot, before the Syrians,and died in the evening, and so the blood of the wound ran out into the hollow of the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And a loud cry went through the host, at the going in of the sun, sayingEvery man to his own city! and every man to his own land!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So the king died, and was brought into Samaria,and they buried the king, in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, when the chariot was washed out at the pool of Samaria, the dogs lapped up his blood, also, the harlots, bathed   ,according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now, the rest of the story of Ahab, and all that he did, and the house of ivory that he built, and all the cities that he built, are, they, not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Ahab slept with his fathers,and, Ahaziah his son, reigned, in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now, Jehoshaphat son of Asa, began to reign over Judah,in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jehoshaphat, was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and, twenty-five years, reigned he in Jerusalem,and, the name of his mother, was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he walked in all the way of Asa his father, he turned not aside therefrom,doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh: nevertheless, the high places, were not taken away,still were the people offering sacrifices and burning incense in the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now, the rest of the story of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are, they, not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Moreover, the rest of the male devotees who remained in the days of Asa his father, he consumed out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, king, was there none in Edom, a prefect, was king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jehoshaphat, made ships of Tarshish, to go to Ophir, for gold; but they went not,for ships had been broken to pieces in Ezion-geber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then, said Ahaziah son of Ahab, unto Jehoshaphat, Let, my servants, go with, thy servants, in the ships,but Jehoshaphat did not consent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers, in the city of David his father,and, Jehoram his son, reigned, in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ahaziah son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel, in Samaria, in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,and reigned over Israel, two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he did the thing that was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh,and went in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused, Israel, to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Yea he served Baal, and bowed down to him,and provoked to anger Yahweh, God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
