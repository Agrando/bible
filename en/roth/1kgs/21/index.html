So he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and did eat no food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then came unto him Jezebel his wife,and said unto himWhy is it, that thy spirit is sullen, that thou art, not eating food?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto herBecause I spake unto Naboth, the Jezreelite, and said unto himCome! give me thy vineyard for silver, or, if thou wouldst prefer, I will give thee a vineyard, in its stead; and he saidI will not give thee my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jezebel his wife said unto him: Art, thou, still, going to carry on the kingdom over Israel? Rise! eat food, and let thy heart be merry, I, will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So she wrote letters, in the name of Ahab, and sealed them with his signet-ring,and sent the letters unto the elders, and unto the nobles who were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now she wrote in the letters, saying,Proclaim ye a fast, and cause Naboth to sit at the head of the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>then let two reckless men take their seats before him, that they may bear witness against him, saying, Thou hast reviled God and king! then shall ye carry him forth and stone him, that he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did just as Jezebel had sent unto them,as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>they proclaimed a fast,and caused Naboth to sit at the head of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then came in the two reckless men, and sat before him, and the men bare witness against him, even against Naboth, before the people, saying, Naboth hath reviled God and king! So they carried him forth, outside the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then sent they unto Jezebel, saying,Naboth is stoned and is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said unto AhabRise! take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for silver, for Naboth is not alive, but dead!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose, to go down unto the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then came the word of Yahweh unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise! go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria,lo! he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he hath gone down, to take possession thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then shalt thou speak unto him, sayingThus, saith Yahweh, Hast thou committed murder, and also taken possession? Then shalt thou speak unto him, saying: Thus, saith Yahweh, In the place where the dogs have lapped up the blood of Naboth, shall the dogs lap up thy blood, even thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said Ahab unto Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he said: I have found   ! Because thou hast sold thyself to do the thing that is wicked in the eyes of Yahweh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold me!   bringing in upon thee, calamity, and I will consume after thee,and cut off of Ahab, even the meanest, whether shut up or left at large in Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and will deliver up thy houseLike the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah,for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked, and caused, Israel, to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover also, concerning Jezebel, hath Yahweh spoken, saying,The dogs, shall eat Jezebel, in the town-land of Jezreel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Him that dieth, of Ahab, in the city, shall, the dogs, eat,and, him that dieth in the field, shall, the birds of heaven, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But indeed, there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do the thing that was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh,whom Jezebel his wife goaded on;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that he did very abominably, in going after the manufactured gods,according to all which the Amorites had done, whom Yahweh dispossessed from before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard these words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted,and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then came the word of Yahweh unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Hast thou seen that Allah hath humbled himself, before me? Because he hath humbled himself before me, I will not bring in the calamity in his days, In the days of his son, will I bring in the calamity upon his house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
