And he saidPeaceably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said heI have somewhat to say unto thee. And she saidSay on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he saidThou, knowest that, mine, was the kingdom, and, on me, had all Israel set their faces, that I should become king,howbeit the kingdom, hath turned about, and become my brothers, for, from Yahweh, became it, his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, therefore, one request, have I to ask of thee, do not turn away my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said unto himSay on. And he saidSpeak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, for he will not turn away thy face,that he give me Abishag the Shunammite, to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bath-sheba said: Good! I myself, will speak for thee, unto the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Bath-sheba went in unto King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah,and the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself down to her, and sat down upon his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said sheOne small request, am I asking of thee, do not turn away my face. And the king said to herAsk on, my mother, for I will not turn away thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother, to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then answered King Solomon, and said to his motherWherefore, then, art thou asking Abishag the Shunammite, for Adonijah? ask, then, for him the kingdom, because he is mine elder brother,even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab, son of Zeruiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then swore King Solomon by Yahweh, saying,So, let God do to me, and, so, let him add, if, at the cost of his life, Adonijah hath not spoken this word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, therefore, by the life of Yahweh, who hath established me, and seated me upon the throne of David my father, and who hath made for me a household, as he had spoken, surely, to-day, shall Adonijah be put to death!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah son of Jehoiada,and he fell upon him, that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Also, unto Abiathar the priest, said the kingTo Anathoth, get thee unto thine own fields, for, death-doomed, thou art,but, this day, will I not put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of My Lord, Yahweh, before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Yahweh,to fulfil the word of Yahweh which he spake concerning the household of Eli, in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, the report, came unto Joab, for, Joab, had inclined after Adonijah, although, after Solomon, he had not inclined,so then Joab fled into the Tent of Yahweh, and laid hold of the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it was told King SolomonJoab hath fled into the Tent of Yahweh, and, there he is, beside the altar. So Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, sayingGo fall upon him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Benaiah came into the Tent of Yahweh, and said unto himThus, saith the king, Come forth! And he saidNay! but, here, will I die! So Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus, spake Joab, and, thus, he answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king said to himDo as he hath spoken, fall, then, upon him, and bury him,and so put away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from off me, and from off the house of my father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>thus will Yahweh bring back his blood upon his own head, in that he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing it,even Abner son of Ner, general of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, general of the army of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>thus shall their blood come back upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed unto times age-abiding,but, David and his seed, and his house, and his throne, shall have peace, unto times age-abiding, from Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and put him to death,and he was buried in his own house, in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada, in his stead, over the army,and, Zadok the priest, did the king put in the stead of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the king sent, and called for Shimei, and said to himBuild thee a house, in Jerusalem, so shalt thou dwell there,and shalt not go forth from thence, hither or thither;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but it shall be that, on the day thou goest forth, and passest over the Kidron ravine, know, that thou shalt, die,thy blood, shall be, upon thine own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Shimei said to the kingGood, is the word, as my lord the king hath spoken, so, will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it came to pass, at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei fled unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath,and they told Shimei, sayingLo! thy servants are in Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath, unto Achish, to seek his servantsand Shimei went and brought in his servants, from Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it was told SolomonShimei hath been out of Jerusalem to Gath, and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then sent the king and called for Shimei, and said unto himDid I not put thee on oath by Yahweh, and adjure thee, sayingOn the day thou goest forth and takest thy journey hither or thither, know, that thou shalt, die. Then saidst thou unto meGood, is the word I have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why then, hast thou not kept the oath of Yahweh,and the charge which I laid upon thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then said the king unto ShimeiThou, knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, which thou didst unto David my father,therefore shall Yahweh bring back thy wickedness, upon thine own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But, King Solomon, shall be blessed,and, the throne of David, shall be established before Yahweh, unto times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So the king charged Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him, that he died,and, the kingdom, was established in the hand of Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
