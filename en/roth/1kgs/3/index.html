I have done according to thy word,lo! I have given unto thee a wise and discerning heart, so that, like thee, hath been none, before thee, and, after thee, shall rise up none, like thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moreover also, what thou hast not asked, have I given unto thee, both riches and honour,so that there hath been none, like thee, among the kings, all thy days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, if thou wilt walk in my ways, by keeping my statutes, and my commandments, as, David thy father, walked, then will I lengthen out thy days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Solomon awoke, and lo! it was a dream. So he entered into Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and caused to go up ascending-sacrifices and offered peace-offerings, and made a banquet for all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then, came there in two unchaste women, unto the king,and stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the one woman saidPardon, my lord! I and this woman, dwell in one house,and I gave birth to a child near her, in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, the third day after I bare, that, this woman also, gave birth to a child,we two, being together, there was no stranger with us in the house, none but we two in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this womans son died in the night,because she overlaid it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then arose she, in the middle of the night, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid was sleeping, and laid it in her own besom,but, her dead son, laid she in, my, bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, when I arose in the morning, to give suck unto my child, lo! it was dead! but, when I looked at it narrowly in the morning, lo! it was not, my son that I had borne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said the other womanNay! but, my son, is the, living, and, thy son, the, dead. But, this, one kept on sayingNay, verily! but, thy son, is the, dead, and, my son, the, living. Thus spake they before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said the king, The one woman, is saying, This, is, my son, the one that liveth, and, thy son, is, the one that is dead,and, the other, is saying, Nay! but, thy son, is, the dead one, and, my son, the, living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king saidBring me a sword! So they brought a sword before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said the king, Divide the living child, in twain,and give half to the one, and half to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then spake the woman, whose was the living child, unto the kingfor tender became her compassions over her sonso she saidPardon, my lord! Give, her, the living child, and do not, kill, it. But the other kept on sayingNeither mine, nor thine, shall it be, divide it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then responded the king, and saidGive, her, the living child, ye shall not, kill, it,she, is its mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had delivered, and they stood in awe before the king,for they saw, that, the wisdom of God, was in him, to execute justice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
