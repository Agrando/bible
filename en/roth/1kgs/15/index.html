And there was, war, between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So then Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David,and, Asa his son, reigned, in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, began Asa to reign as king of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and, forty-one years, reigned he in Jerusalem,and, the name of his mother, was Maachah, daughter of Abishalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh,like David his father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he put away the male devotees out of the land,and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moreover also, even Maachah his mother, he removed from being queen, because she had made a monstrous thing to the Sacred Stem,and Asa cut down her monstrous thing and burned it in the Kidron ravine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, the high places, removed he not,nevertheless, the heart of Asa, was blameless with Yahweh, all his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he brought in the hallowed things of his father, and his own hallowed things, into the house of Yahweh,silver and gold, and vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there was, war, between Asa and Baasha king of Israel, all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah,so as not to suffer any one to come out or go in unto Asa king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Asa took all the silver and the gold, that were left in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the house of the king, and delivered them into the hand of his servants,and King Asa sent them unto Ben-hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>between my father and thy father: Lo! I have sent thee a gift, silver and gold, Come break thy covenant with Baasha, king of Israel, that he may go up from against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Ben-hadad hearkened unto King Asa, and sent the generals of the forces which he had, against the cities of Israel, and smote Iyyohn  Ijon , and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah,and all Chinneroth, against all the land of Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, he left off building Ramah,and returned to Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, King Asa, published it unto all Judah, none was exempted, so they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the beams thereof, wherewith Baasha had built,and King Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, the rest of all the story of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did and the cities which he built, are, they, not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
