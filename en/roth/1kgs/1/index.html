And they came in before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then said the king unto themTake ye with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon the mule which pertaineth unto myself,and bring him down unto Gihon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>then shall Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel,and ye shall blow with the horn, and sayLong live King Solomon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then shall ye come up after him, and he shall enter, and sit upon my throne, yea, he, shall become king in my stead; even, him, have I charged to become leader, over Israel, and over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then did Benaiah son of Jehoiada make response unto the king, and sayAmen! so, say Yahweh, God of my lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As Yahweh hath been with my lord the king, so, let him he with Solomon,and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord, King David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, with the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon the mule of King David,and they escorted him to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then took Zadok the priest, the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon,and they blew with a   horn, and all the people said, Long live King Solomon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the people came up after him, the people themselves also, playing with flutes, and rejoicing with great joy,so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Adonijah, and all the guests who were with him, heard it, just as, they, had made an end of eating,and, when Joab heard the sound of a horn, he saidWherefore the noise of the city, in tumult?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>While yet he was speaking, lo! Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest, came in,and Adonijah saidCome in, for, a worthy man, thou art, and, good tidings, dost thou bring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But Jonathan responded and said to Adonijah,Of a truth, our lord, King David, hath made, Solomon, king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the king hath sent with himZadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, with the Cherethites, and the Pelethites,and they have caused him to ride upon the mule of the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king, in Gihon, and they went up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again,That, is the noise ye have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Moreover also, Solomon hath taken his seat upon the throne of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Moreover also, the servants of the king have been in, to bless our lord King David, sayingThy God make the name better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne,And the king bowed himself upon his bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Moreover also, thus and thus, hath said the king,Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, who hath given, to-day, one to sit upon my throne, mine own eyes also beholding it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then trembled and rose up, all Adonijahs guests,and departed, every man his own way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Adonijah also, feared because of Solomon,and rose and went, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it was told Solomon, saying, Lo! Adonijah, feareth King Solomon,lo! therefore, he hath laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear unto me at once that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said Solomon, If he will be a man of worth, there shall not one hair of him fall to the earth,but, if mischief be found in him, then shall he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So King Solomon sent, and brought him down from the altar, and he came in, and bowed himself down to King Solomon,and Solomon said unto himGo to thine own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
