Thus, saith Yahweh,Lo! a son to be born unto the house of David, Josiah his name, who shall sacrifice upon thee the priests of the high-places, who are making a perfume upon thee, and, human bones, shall be burned upon thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he shall give, on that day, a sign, saying, This, is the sign of which Yahweh hath spoken,Lo! the altar, is to be rent, and the ashes that are upon thee shall be, poured out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, when the king heard the word of the man of God which he proclaimed against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam thrust forth his hand, from off the altar, sayingLay hold of him! and his hand which he had thrust forth against him was dried up, that he could not draw it back to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover, the altar, was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,according to the sign which the man of God had given, by the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then responded the king and said unto the man of GodAppease, I pray thee, the face of Yahweh thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored unto me. So the man of God appeased the face of Yahweh, and the hand of the king was restored unto him, and became as aforetime.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then spake the king unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself,and let me give thee a present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the man of God said unto the kingIf thou wouldst give me the half of thy house, I would not go in with thee,neither would I eat bread or drink water, in this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for, so, he charged me, by the word of Yahweh, saying, Thou shalt not eat bread, nor shalt thou drink water,neither shalt thou come back by the way thou wentest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he departed another way,and went not back by the way by which he came unto Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, a certain aged prophet, was dwelling in Bethel,whose sons came in and related to him all the deeds which the man of God had done that day in Betheland the words which he had spoken unto the king, and they related them to their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their father said unto them, Which way then went he? Now his sons had seen the way which the man of God went who had come in out of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he said unto his sons, Saddle for me, the ass. And they saddled for him the ass, and he rode thereon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and went after the man of God, and found him, sitting under an oak. And he said unto himArt, thou, the man of God who came in out of Judah? And he saidI am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said he unto him, Come home with me,and eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saidI may not return with thee, nor go in with thee,neither will I eat bread or drink water with thee, in this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for there came a message unto me by the word of Yahweh, Thou shalt neither eat bread, nor drink water there,thou shalt not turn back to come by the way by which thou wentest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to him-I also, am a prophet, like unto thee, and, a messenger, hath spoken unto me, by the word of Yahweh, sayingBring him back with thee, into thy house, that he may eat bread, and drink water. He deceived him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so it was, as, they, were sitting at the table, yea, so it was, that the word of Yahweh came unto the prophet who had brought him back;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he cried out unto the man of God who had come in out of Judah, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh,Forasmuch as thou hast rebelled against the bidding of Yahweh, and hast not kept the commandment which Yahweh thy God commanded thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but hast returned, and eaten bread and drunk water, in the place of which he said unto thee, Thou mayest neither eat bread nor drink water: thy dead body shall not enter the burying-place of thy fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, when he had gone, there met him a lion by the way, and slew him,and his dead body was cast out in the way, and, the ass, was standing near it, and, the lion, was standing near the dead body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And lo! certain men, passing by, saw the dead body, cast out in the way, and the lion standing near the dead body,so they came in, and spake   in the city, wherein, the aged prophet, dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he saidThe man of God, it is, who rebelled against the bidding of Yahweh,therefore did Yahweh deliver him unto the lion, and it hath torn him and slain him, according to the word of Yahweh which he spake unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he spake unto his sons, saying, Saddle for me the ass. And they saddled it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So he went and found his dead body, cast out in the way, with, the ass and the lion, standing near the dead body,the lion had neither eaten the dead body, nor had it torn the ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the prophet took up the dead body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back,and the aged prophet came into the city, to make lamentation, and to bury him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he laid his dead body in his own grave,and they lamented over him,   Alas, my brother!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake unto his sons, saying, When I die, then shall ye bury me in the grave wherein the man of God is buried; beside his bones, lay my bones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the message which he proclaimed, by the ward of Yahweh, against the altar which is in Bethel,and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After this thing, Jeroboam turned not from his wicked way,but again made, from the whole compass of the people, priests of high places, whomsoever he would, he installed, and he became priest of high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And so this thing became the sin of the house of Jeroboam,that it should be both taken away and destroyed, from off the face of the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
