Wherefore the name of that place is called Gilgal unto this day. \fs15</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus then the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal,and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the waste plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they did eat of the corn of the land, on the morrow of the passover, unleavened cakes and parched ears of corn,on this selfsame day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they had eaten of the corn of the land, neither had the sons of Israel manna any more,so they did eat of the yield of the land of Canaan throughout that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, while Joshua was at Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes, and looked, and lo! a man standing over against him, with his sword drawn, in his hand,so Joshua went unto him, and said to him, For us, art thou, or for our adversaries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he saidNay, but, I, as prince of the host of Yahweh, have, now, come. So Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said unto him, What is my lord speaking unto his servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said the prince of the host of Yahweh unto JoshuaSlip off thy sandals from thy feet, for, as for the place whereon thou art standing, holy, it is. And Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
