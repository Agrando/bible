So the men went up, and spied out Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they returned unto Joshua and said unto himLet not all the people go up, about two thousand men or three thousand men, can go up and smite Ai,do not weary the whole people to go thither, for, but few, they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There went up thither of the people therefore, about three thousand men,but they fled before the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men, and pursued them before the gate as far as the Shebarim, and smote them on the slope,so that the heart of the people melted and became as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Joshua rent his clothes and fell upon his face to the earth before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel,and they lifted up dust upon their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joshua saidAlas! My Lord Yahweh! Wherefore hast thou, brought, this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us? Would then we had been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh My Lord,what shall I say, after Israel have turned their backs before their enemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Only let the Canaanite and all the inhabitants of the land hear, and they will surround us, and cut off our name out of the earth,what then wilt thou do for thy great name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Yahweh said unto JoshuaGet thee up! wherefore is it that thou art lying upon thy face?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Israel hath sinned, yea moreover they have transgressed my covenant which I commanded them,yea moreover they have taken of what was devoted, yea moreover they have stolen, yea moreover they have dissembled, yea moreover they have put it among their own goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore cannot the sons of Israel stand before their enemies, their back, do they turn before their enemies, because they have become devoted,I will no more be with you, except ye destroy the devoted thing out of your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Up! hallow the people, and thou shalt say, Hallow yourselves by to-morrow,for, Thus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel: A devoted thing, is in the midst of thee O Israel, Thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye have put away the devoted thing out of your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore shall ye be brought near in the morning by your tribes,and it shall be thatthe tribe which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, by families, and the family which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, by households, and the household which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, man by man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and it shall be, thatHe that is seized with the devoted thing, shall be burned with fire, he and all that he hath,because he hath transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he hath wrought impiety in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes,and, the tribe of Judah, was seized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he brought near the family of Judah, and, the family of the Zarhites, was seized,and he brought near the family of the Zarhites, man by man, and, Zabdi, was seized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he brought near his household, man by man,and, Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was seized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Joshua said unto AchanMy son give I pray thee glory unto Yahweh God of Israel and make to him confession,and tell me I pray thee what thou hast done, do not hide it from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Achan answered Joshua and said,Of a truth, I, have sinned against Yahweh God of Israel, and, thus and thus, have I done:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When I saw among the spoil a certain goodly mantle of Babylonia and two hundred shekels of silver and a certain wedge of goldfifty shekels the weight thereof, then I coveted them, then I took them,and, there they are, hid in the earth, in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent,and, there it was, hid in his tent, and, the silver, under it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them in unto Joshua, and unto all the sons of Israel,and poured them out before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achanson of Zerah, and the silver and the mantle and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent, and all that he had, and brought them up the valley of Achor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua saidWhy hast thou troubled us? Yahweh, will trouble thee, this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them up with fire, and covered them with stones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>yea they raised over him a great heap of stones</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
