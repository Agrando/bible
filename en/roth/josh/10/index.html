Is not, that, written in the Book of the Upright? So then the sun stayed in the middle of the heavens, and hastened not to go in, about a whole day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there was no day like thatbefore it or after it, when Yahweh hearkened unto the voice of a man,in that, Yahweh, himself fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So these five kings fled,and hid themselves in a cave, at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told Joshua, saying,The five kings are found, hid in a cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joshua said, Roll ye great stones against the mouth of the cave,and set over it men, to watch them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but do not, ye, stay, chase after your enemies, so shall ye attack them in the rear,do not suffer them to enter into their cities, for Yahweh your God hath delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel had made an end of smiting them with a very great slaughter, until they were spent, then did, the remainder that were left of them, enter into the fortified cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the people returned unto the camp, unto Joshua at Makkedah, in peace,none sharpened his tongue at any man of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said Joshua, Open ye the mouth of the cave,and bring out unto me, these five kings, out of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did so, and brought out unto him, these five kings, out of the cave,namely, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when they brought out these kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war who had been with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. So they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said Joshua unto them: Do not fear, nor be alarmed,be firm and bold, for, thus and thus, will Yahweh do unto all your enemies, against whom ye do fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua smote them after this, and put them to death, and hanged them upon five trees,and they remained hung on the trees, until the evening,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, at the time of the going in of the sun, that Joshua gave command, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave, where they had hid themselves,and put great stones upon the mouth of the cave,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua captured, Makkedah, on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and, the king thereof, devoted he to destruction, them and all the souls that were therein, he left no survivor,but did unto the king of Makkedah, as he had done unto the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Joshua passed over, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah unto Libnah,and fought against Libnah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and Yahweh delivered, it also, into the hand of Israel, with the king thereof, and he smote it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls that were therein, he left therein no survivor,but did unto the king thereof, as he had done unto the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joshua passed over, and all Israel with him, from Libnah unto Lachish,and encamped against it, and fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls that were therein,according to all that he had done unto Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then, came up Horam, king of Gezer, to help Lachish,and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had not left him a survivor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Joshua passed over, and all Israel with him, from Lachish unto Eglon,and they encamped against it, and fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and captured it on the same day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and, all the souls that were therein, on that day, devoted he to destruction,according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon unto Hebron,and they fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, with all the souls that were thereinhe left not a survivor, according to all that he had done to Eglon,he devoted it to destruction, and all the souls that were therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Joshua turned back, and all Israel with him, unto Debir,and fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and captured it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and devoted to destruction every soul that was therein, he left not a survivor,as he had done unto Hebron, so, did he unto Debir, and unto the king thereof, as also he had done unto Libnah, and unto her king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Joshua smote all the landthe hill country, and the south, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings, he left not a survivor,but, every breathing thing, devoted he to destruction, as Yahweh, God of Israel, had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea Joshua smote them, from Kadesh-barnea, even as far as Gaza,and all the land of Goshen, even as far as Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Yea, all these kings and their land, did Joshua capture at one time,because, Yahweh, God of Israel, fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
