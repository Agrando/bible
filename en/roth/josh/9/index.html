And Joshua said unto them: Who, are ye? And, from whence, come ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said unto himFrom a very far country, have thy servants come, because of the name of Yahweh thy God,because we had heard his fame, and all that he had done in Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and all that he had done unto the two kings of the Amorites who were over the Jordan,unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, and unto Og, king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spake unto us, sayingTake ye, in your hand, provision for the journey, and go your way to meet them,then shall ye say unto them, Your servants, we are. Now, therefore, solemnise with us a covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This our bread, took we, hot, for our provision, out of our houses, on the day we came forth to journey unto you,but, now, lo! it is dry, yea it is broken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and, these leathern wine bottles, which we filled new, lo! also, they are rent,and, as for these our mantles and our sandals, they are worn out, by reason of the very long journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the men took of their provision,but, the bidding of Yahweh, had they not asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua made peace with them, and solemnised with them a covenant to let them live,and the princes of the assembly, entered into an oath with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, at the end of three days after they had solemnised with them a covenant, that they heard that, near neighbours, they were unto them, and, in their midst, they were dwelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the sons of Israel brake up, and came in unto their cities on the third day,their cities, being Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the assembly had sworn unto them by Yahweh, God of Israel,but all the assembly murmured against the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the princes said unto all the assembly, We, have sworn unto them, by Yahweh, God of Israel,now, therefore, we may not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This, will we do unto them, even let them live,lest there come on us wrath, because of the oath which we have sworn unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the princes said unto themLet them live. So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the assembly, as the princes spake unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua called for them, and spake unto them, saying,Wherefore did ye deceive us, sayingWe are, very far, from you, whereas, ye, in our midst, are dwelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, therefore, accursed, ye are,and ye shall not cease to be in bond-service as hewers of wood and drawers of water, for the house of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they responded to Joshua, and saidBecause it was, plainly told, thy servants, how that Yahweh thy God had commanded Moses his servant to give unto you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you,therefore feared we greatly, for our lives, because of you, and did this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, therefore, here we are, in thy hand,as may be good and right in thine eyes, to do unto us, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he did to them so,and rescued them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, and they slew them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua appointed them that day to be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto the assembly,and unto the altar of Yahweh,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
