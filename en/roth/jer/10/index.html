For, thee, doth it beseem; Forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations And throughout all their royal estate, None, there is like unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But at once, do they become brutish and stupid,An example of utmost vanity, is, a tree!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Silver spread into plates, from Tarshish is brought, And gold, from Uphaz, Work for the craftsman and for the hands of the smith,Blue and purple, is their clothing, Work for the skilled, are they all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, Yahweh, is God in truth, He, is a God that, liveth, And a King of times age-abiding,At his anger, quaketh the earth, And nations cannot endure his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus, shall ye say unto them, The gods that made not the heavens, And the earth, Shall perish out of the earth, And from under these heavens!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that made the earth by his power, That established the world by his wisdom,And by his understanding stretched out the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the voice that he uttered, there was a tumult of waters in the heavens, And he caused vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth,The lightnings for rain, he made, And brought forth wind out of his treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every son of earth hath become too brutish to discern, Every goldsmith, hath been put to shame by a graven image,For a falsehood, is his molten image, Seeing there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Vanity, they are, the handiwork of mockeries,In the time of their visitation, shall they perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Not like these, is the portion of Jacob, For the fashioner of all things, is, he, And, Israel, is his inherited sceptre,Yahweh of hosts, is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fold up, from the ground thy travelling carpet,O inhabitress of the fortress;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, thus, saith Yahweh, Behold me! slinging out the inhabitants of the land at this throw,And I will distress them that they may discover it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe to me! for my grievous injury, Severe, is my wound,But, I, said, Verily, this, is an affliction and I must bear it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent, is laid waste, And all my tent-cords, are broken,My children, are gone forth from me and they, are not. There is none, To stretch out any more my tent, Or to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the shepherds, have become brutish, And Yahweh, have they not sought,For this cause, have they not prospered, And, all their flock, is scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The noise of a rumour! lo it hath come! Even a great commotion out of the land of the North,To make the cities of Judah, A desolation, A den of jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I know O Yahweh, That not to a son of earth, pertaineth his own path,Not, to the man who walketh, also to direct his own steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Chastise me, O Yahweh But yet in measure,Not in thine anger, lest thou make me few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy wrathUpon the nations that know thee not, and Upon the families that, upon thy Name, have not called,For they have devoured Jacob Yea they have devoured him and consumed him, And, his habitation, have they made desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
