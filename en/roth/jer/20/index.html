Tell ye   , that we may tell of him, All the men I am wont to salute do watch for my halting,Peradventure he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail over him, and take our vengeance upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, Yahweh, is with me, as a mighty one striking terror, For this cause, shall my persecutors stumble and not prevail,They have turned very pale, For they have not prospered, Confusion age-abiding, it shall not be forgotten!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But O Yahweh of hostsTesting the righteous Beholding the affections and the heart,Let me see thine avenging upon them, For unto thee, have I laid bare my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing ye to Yahweh!
