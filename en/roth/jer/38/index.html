And when I counsel thee, thou wilt not hearken unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So King Zedekiah aware unto Jeremiah secretly saying,By the life of Yahweh who made for us, this soul, I will in no wise put thee to death, Neither will I deliver thee into the hand of these men who are seeking thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Jeremiah unto ZedekiahThus, saith Yahweh God of hosts, God of IsraelIf thou wilt, indeed go forth, unto the princes of the king of Babylon, then shall thine own soul live, and, this city, shall not be burned with fire,but thou shalt live, thou and thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, if thou wilt not go forth unto the princes of the king of Babylon, then shall this city be delivered into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and, thou, shalt not escape out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said King Zedekiah unto Jeremiah: I am afraid of the Jews who have fallen away unto the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me, into their hand, and they maltreat me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver!Hearken I pray thee unto the voice of Yahweh in what I am speaking unto thee, that it may be well with thee and thy soul live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if thou art refusing to go forth, this, is the thing which Yahweh hath shewed me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>behold, then, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Judah, brought forth unto the princes of the king of Babylon,and, these very women, saying, The men thou wast wont to salute, have goaded thee on and prevailed upon thee,Thy foot having sunk in the mire, they have turned away back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yea thou shalt behold all thy wives and thy children brought forth unto the Chaldeans, and thou, shalt not escape out of their hand,but by the hand of the king of Babylon, shalt thou be taken, and, this city, shall be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Zedekiah unto JeremiahDo not let, any man, know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, when the princes hear that I have spoken with thee and they come in unto thee and say unto theeDo tell us we pray thee what thou didst speak unto the king, do not hide it from us so will we not put thee to death,and what spake the king unto, thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then shalt thou say unto them,I was causing my supplication to fall prostrate before the king,that he would not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan, to die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then came in all the princes unto Jeremiah and asked him, and he told them according to all these words which the king, had commanded,so they turned in silence from him, for the matter, had not been reported.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jeremiah remained in the guard-court, until the day when Jerusalem, was captured; thus it fell out when Jerusalem, was captured.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
