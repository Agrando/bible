And every neighbour, as a tale-bearer, goeth about;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yea, every one, of his neighbour, maketh a dupe, And, truth, they do not speak,They have taught their tongue to speak falsehood, In acting perversely, they have wearied themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thy dwelling, is in the midst of deceit,Through deceit, have they rejected the knowledge of, me, Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Behold me! melting them, so will I try them,For how else should I do because of the wickedness of the daughter of my people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A pointed arrow, is their tongue Deceit, hath it spoken,With his mouth peace unto his neighbour, doth one speak, But within himself, he layeth his ambush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For these things, shall I not bring punishment on them?

And, unto whom, hath the mouth of Yahweh spoken, That he may declare it? For what cause Hath the land perished, Hath it been burned as a wilderness that no man passeth through?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said Yahweh,Because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them,And have not hearkened to hay voice neither walked therein;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But have gone their way, After the stubbornness of their own heart,And after the Baals which their fathers taught them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, Thus saith Yahweh of hosts, The God of Israel, Behold me!
