Thou hast smitten them Yet have they not grieved, Thou hast consumed themThey have refused to receive correction,They have made their faces bolder than a cliff, They have refused to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, I, said,Only, poor people, are they,They act foolishly, For they know not the way of Yahweh, the justice of their God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will betake me unto the great men, and will speak, with them! For, they, know the way of Yahweh, the justice of their God! Yea but, they, with one accord have broken the yoke, torn off the bands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this cause, hath the lion out of the forest smitten them, The wolf of the waste plains, preyeth upon them, The leopard, is keeping watch over their cities, Every one that goeth out from thence, is torn in pieces,For they have multiplied their transgressions, Numerous are their apostasies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How, for this, can I pardon thee? Thine own sons, have forsaken me, And have sworn by No-gods,When I had fed them to the full, Then committed they adultery, And the house of the unchaste woman, they used to throng:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lusty, well-fed horses, had they become, Every man unto his neighbours wife, would neigh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For these things, shall I not punish? Demandeth Yahweh: Yea on a nation such as this, must not my soul avenge herself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Scale ye her walls and destroy, But a full end, do not make,Remove her tendrils, For not to Yahweh, do, they, belong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For very treacherously, have the house of Israel and the house of Judah dealt with me, Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have acted deceptively against Yahweh, And have said, Not He! Neither shall there come upon us, calamity, Nor sword nor famine, shall we see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prophets, shall prove to be wind, And there is no one speaking in them,Thus, shall it be done to themselves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, Thus, saith Yahweh, God of hosts, Because ye have spoken this word,Behold me! making my words in thy mouth to be fire, And, this people,wood, So shall it devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold me! bringing upon you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, Declareth Yahweh,A nation invincible, it is, A nation from age-past times, hath it been, A nation whose tongue thou shalt not know, Neither shalt thou understand what it speaketh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Its quiver, is like an open sepulchre,They all, are heroes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then shall it eat thy harvest and thy bread which thy sons and thy daughters should eat,It shall eat thy flock and thy herd, It shall eat thy vine and thy fig-tree,It shall destroy thy defenced cities wherein thou, art trusting, with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet, even in those days, Declareth Yahweh, Will I not make of you, a full end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, For what cause hath Yahweh our God done to us all these things? Then shalt thou say unto them,As ye forsook me, and served the gods of the foreigner in your own land, So, shall ye serve aliens in a land not your own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tell ye this, throughout the house of Jacob,And let it be heard throughout Judah saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hear this, I pray you ye peoplefoolish and without heart,Eyes, have they, and see not, Ears, have they, and hear not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even for me, will ye have no reverence? Enquireth Yahweh, And because of me, will ye not he pained? In that though I placed the sand as a bound to the sea, A decree age-abiding, and it should not pass beyond it,When they would toss themselves Then should they not prevail, When the waves thereof would roar Then should they not pass beyond it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet, this people hath an obstinate and rebellious heart,They have turned aside, and gone their way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Neither have they said in their heart,Let us we pray you, revere Yahweh our God, Who giveth rain, even the early and the latter, in its season,The appointed weeks of harvest, he reserveth for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your iniquities, have thrust away these things, Yea, your sins, have withholden that which is good from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For there have been found among my people lawless men,One lieth in wait, as with the stooping of fowlers, They have set a trap, they capture men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As, a cage, is full of birds, So, are, their houses, full of unrighteous gain,For this cause, have they become great and waxen rich:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They have waxed fat, they shine Yea they have overpassed the records of wickedness. The right, have they not determined, the right of the fatherless that they might prosper,Yea justice to the helpless, have they not decreed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Upon these things, shall I not bring punishment? Demandeth Yahweh. Or, on a nation such as this, shall not my soul avenge herself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>An astounding and horrible thing, hath been brought to pass in the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The prophets, have prophesied, falsely, And the priests tread down by their means, And, my people, love it, so,What then can ye do as to her latter end?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
