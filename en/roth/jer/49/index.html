Hath he no, heir? Why hath, Malkam, taken possession of Gad, Or have, his people, in the cities thereof, made their dwelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore, lo! days are coming, Declareth Yahweh When I will cause to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, an alarm of war, So shall she become a mound of desolation, And, her villages, with fire, shall blaze,Then shall Israel, inherit them who inherited him, Saith Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled Make outcry, ye daughters of Rabbah, Gird you with sackcloth, Lament ye and run to and fro among the fences,For, Malkam, into captivity, shall go, His priests and his princes, together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why shouldst thou glory in the vales, The flowing of thy vale O apostate daughter? She who is trusting in her treasures,   Who shall invade, me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold me! bringing upon thee, terror Declareth My Lord, Yahweh of hosts, From all who are round about thee,And ye shall be driven out every man before it, And there shall be none to bring home the wanderer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But afterwards, will I bring back the captivity of the sons of Ammon, Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of EdomThus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Hath counsel perished from the discerning? Is their wisdom corrupt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee ye turn go down deep to dwell, O inhabitant of Dedan,For the doom of Esau, have I brought in upon him The time of his visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If, grape-gatherers, came to thee, Would they not leave, gleanings? If, thieves in the night, Would they not have taken away what sufficed them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, I, have stripped Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, And to conceal himself, shall he not be able! Spoiled, are his seed, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leave thy fatherless children I, will preserve them alive,And thy widows, In me, let them trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For, thus saith YahwehLo! they who had not been adjudged to drink the cup, shall surely drink, And art thou, the one to go unpunished? Thou shalt not go unpunished, but shalt surely drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>or by myself, have I sworn, Declareth Yahweh, That, Bozrah shall become, an astonishment: a reproach and a desolation, and a contempt,And all her cities shall become age-abiding desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A report, have I heard from Yahweh, Yea, an envoy, throughout the nations, hath been sent,Gather yourselves together and come against her, And arise to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For lo!

For who shall be like unto, me? And who shall appoint me, a time? And who is the Shepherd that shall stand before, me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore, hear ye The counsel of Yahweh which he hath counseled against Edom, And his devices which he hath devised against the inhabitants of Teman,Surely the little ones of the flock shall drag them away, Surely he will cause their fold to be astounded over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At the noise of their fail, hath trembled the earth, At the outcry, in the Red Sea, was heard its noise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Lo! as an eagle, he shall mount and dart, and spread his wings over Bozrah,So shall the heart of the heroes of Edom, in that day, become as the heart of a woman in her pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of Damascus.
