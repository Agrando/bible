And, they who handled the law, did not acknowledge me, And the shepherds transgressed against me,And the prophets, prophesied by Baal, And so after things that could not profit, did they walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore yet further will I plead with you Declareth Yahweh, Yea with your childrens children, will I plead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Forpass through the coastlands of the West and see, And unto Kedar, send ye and consider diligently,And seewhether there hath been the like of this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Hath a nation, changed gods, although they were No-gods? Yet my people have changed my glory for that which could not profit!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be amazed, O ye heavens, at this,And shudder, be dried up utterly, Urgeth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For two wicked things, have my people committed,Me, have they forsaken a fountain of living water, To hew out for themselves cisterns broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Was Israel a servant? Born in the house, was he? Wherefore hath he become a prey?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Against him, have been roaring wild lions, They have uttered their voice,and have made his land a desolation, His cities, have been burned, so as to have no inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even the sons of Noph and Tahpanhes have been crushing the crown of the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is not this what thou wast certain to do for thyself,in that thou didst forsake Yahweh thy God, when he was leading thee by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now, therefore what hast thou to do with the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? Or what hast thou to do with the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? \fs15</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let thy wickedness correct thee And thine apostasies, rebuke thee, Know therefore and see That it is a wicked thing and a bitter, that thou shouldest have forsaken Yahweh thy God, And that the dread of me should not have pertained to thee, Declareth My Lord, Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, in age-past time, I brake thy yoke, I tare off thy fetters, And thou saidst, I will not transgress,Nevertheless, on every high hill, and under every green tree, wast thou lying down as an unchaste woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet, I, planted thee a precious vine, a wholly true seed,How then didst thou change thyself towards me, into the degenerate plantings of the alien vine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though thou wash thee with nitre, And take thee much soap, Yet is thine iniquity inscribed before me Declareth My Lord Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How canst thou say, I have not defiled myself, After the Baalim, have I not gone? See thy way, in the valley, Own what thou hast done,A nimble young she-camel, crossing her own ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A wild ass, taught of the desert, In the desire of her soul, she snuffeth the wind, In her occasion, who can turn her back? None who seek her, will weary themselves, In her month, they shall find her!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Withhold thy foot from being unshod, And thy throat from thirst! But thou saidst Hopeless! No! for I love foreigners and after them, will I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the shame of a thief when he is found, So, hath been put to shame, the house of Israel,They, their kings their princes, and their priests and their prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Saying, to a tree, My father, art thou! And to a stone, Thou, didst give us birth, For they have turned unto me the back and not the face,But in the time of their calamity, they will say, Arise, and save us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Where then are thy gods which thou hast made for thyself? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy calamity,For according to the number of thy cities, have become thy gods O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wherefore, should ye plead against me, All of you, have transgressed against me Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In vain, have I smitten your children, Correction, have they not accepted,Your sword hath devoured your prophets, as a lion that destroyeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O generation see, ye, the word of Yahweh, A desert, became I unto Israel? Or a land of thick darkness? Wherefore, have my people said, We have roved about, We will not come in any more unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can, a virgin, forget, her ornaments,A bride, her girdle? Yet, my people, have forgotten me, days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>How thou dost make winsome thy way, to seek love! Therefore, even unto wicked women, hast thou taught thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Even in thy skirts, is there found, The blood of the lives of the helpless innocents,Not in the act of breaking in, didst thou find them, yet   on all these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Although thou saidst, Because I am innocent, surely hath his anger turned back from me,Behold me! entering into judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>How vigorously, thou goest about changing thy way! Even of Egypt, shalt thou be ashamed, just as thou wast ashamed of Assyria:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Even from this one, shalt thou go forth, with thy hands upon thy head,For Yahweh hath rejected those in whom thou confidest, and thou shalt not prosper with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
