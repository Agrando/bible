Or as a wayfarer, who hath turned aside to lodge for the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Wherefore, shouldst thou be as a man astounded, As a mighty man who cannot save? Yet, thou, art in our midstO Yahweh And, thy Name, on us, hath been called Do not abandon us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus, saith Yahweh To this people In this way, have they loved to wander, Their feet, have they not restrained,Yahweh, therefore hath not accepted them, Now, will he call to mind their iniquity,That he may punish their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh said unto me,Do not pray for this people for blessing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Though they fast, I am not going to hearken unto their loud cry, and Though they offer ascending-sacrifice and meal-offering, I am not going to accept them,For with sword and with famine and with pestilence, am, I, about to consume them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said I, Ah, My Lord Yahweh! Lo! the prophets, are saying to themYe shall not see the sword And famine, shall ye not have,For prosperity in truth, will I give you, in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So then Yahweh said unto me, Falsehood, are the prophets prophesying in my name, I have not sent them Neither have I commanded them, Neither have I spoken unto them,A vision of falsehood, and A divination of worthlessness and A fraud of their own hearts, They, are prophesying unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, Thus, saith Yahweh concerning the prophets who are prophesying in my Name though, I, sent them not, and yet, they have beer, saying, Neither sword nor famine, shall there be in this land,By sword or by famine, shall these prophets be consumed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people to whom they have been prophesying shall be getting cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword, and of there being none to give burial unto them, them, their wives, nor their sons nor their daughters,So will I pour out upon them their own wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore shalt thou say unto them this word, Let mine eyes, run down with tears night and day, And let them not rest,For with a grievous injury, hath been injured the virgin the daughter of my people, With a wound, severe indeed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I have gone out into the field, Then lo! the slain of the sword! And if have entered the city, Then lo! the diseases of famine! For, both prophet and priest, have trafficked against the land unnoticed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast thou, utterly rejected, Judah? Zion itself, hath thy soul loathed? Why, hast thou smitten us so that there is for us no healing? A waiting For prosperity, but no welfare, and For a time of healing, but lo! terror!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge O Yahweh Our own lawlessness The iniquity of our fathers,For we have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not despisefor the sake of thy Name, Do not treat with contemptthe throne of thy glory,Remember!do not break thy covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there, among the vanities of the nations senders of rain? Or can, the heavens themselves, give myriad drops? Art not, thou, he, O Yahweh our God? Therefore will we wait for thee, For, thou, hast made all these.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
