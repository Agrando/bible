So I knew, that the word of Yahweh, it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I bought the field from Hanameel son of mine uncle that was in Anathoth,and weighed him the silver, seventeen shekels, was the silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and I wrote in the scroll and sealed it, and took in attestation witnesses,and weighed the silver in the balances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then took I the scroll of purchase, both that which was sealedthe title and the conditionsand that which was open;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and gave the scroll of purchase unto Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle  , and in the sight of the witnesses who subscribed the scroll of purchase,in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the guard-court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then charged I Baruch in their sight saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, Take thou these scrolls, this scroll of purchase even that which is sealed, and this scroll that is open, and put them in an earthen vessel,that they may remain many days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel: Again, shall houses and fields and vineyards, be bought, in this land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then prayed I unto Yahweh,after I had delivered the scroll of purchase unto Baruch son of Neriah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Alas!
