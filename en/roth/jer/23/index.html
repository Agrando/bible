Feeding them with wormwood, And I will cause them to drink poisoned water,For from the prophets of Jerusalem, hath there gone forth profanity unto all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts,Do not hearken unto the words of the prophets who are prophesying unto you, They are filling you, with vain hopes,The vision of their own hearts, do they speak, Not from the mouth of Yahweh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They keep on saying to them who despise me, Yahweh, hath spoken, saying, Prosperity, shall ye have! And to every one who is going on in the stubbornness of his own heart, have they said, There shall come on you, no calamity</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For who hath stood in the council of Yahweh, that he should see and hear his word? Who hath given ear to his word and heard it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lo! the tempest of Yahweh! Indignation, hath come forth, Even a tempest whirling along: On the head of the lawless, shall it hurl itself down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of Yahweh, wilt not return, Until he hath executed nor Until he hath established The purposes of his heart,In the afterpart of the days, shall ye understand it perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I sent not the prophets yet they, ran, I spake not unto them yet, they, prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my council, Then might they have announced my words unto my people, And have turned them from their wicked way and from the wickedness of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Am I, a God at hand, Demandeth Yahweh, And not a God afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can any hide himself in secret places that I, shall not see him? Demandeth Yahweh,The heavens and the earth, do I not fill? Demandeth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy in my name falsely, saying,I have dreamed! I have dreamed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long shall it be in the heart of the prophets, To be prophets of falsehood,And prophets of the deceit of their own heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who lay a plot to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they relate every man to his neighbour,Just as their fathers forgat, my name, for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet with whom is a dream, Let him relate it as a dream, And he with whom is my word, Let him speak my word as truth,What is the chaff to the wheat? Demandeth Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is not my word, like this, Like fire? Demandeth Yahweh,And like a hammer, that breaketh in pieces a cliff?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore! behold me! against the prophets, Declareth Yahweh,who steal my words, every man from his neighbour:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold me! against the prophets, Declareth Yahweh, who presume with their tongue and declare He declareth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold me! against such as prophesy the dreams of falsehood, Declareth Yahweh, who have related them and led astray my people, with their falsehoods and with their recklessness,whereas, I, had not sent them nor commanded them, so that they could be of no, profit, to this people, Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when this people or a prophet or a priest shall ask thee saying What is the oracle of Yahweh? Then shalt thou say unto them Ye, yourselves, are the oracle, Therefore will I reject you Declareth Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the prophet, or the priest or the people who shall saythe oracle of Yahweh, I will bring punishment upon that man and upon his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus, shall ye sayevery man mite his neighbour and every man unto his brother,What hath Yahweh, answered? or, What hath Yahweh, spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>but the oracle of Yahweh, shall ye not mention, any more,for, every mans oracle, shall be his own word, because ye have perverted the words of a Living God, Yahweh of hosts our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus, shall thou say unto the prophet,What hath Yahweh, answered thee? or What hath Yahweh, spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But, since ye keep on saying, The Oracle of Yahweh, therefore, Thus saith Yahweh, Because ye have said this word, The oracle of Yahweh, whereas I had sent unto you saying, Ye shall not say, The oracle of Yahweh</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>therefore, behold me! I will lift you up,and carry you away, and the city which I gave to you and to your fathers from before my face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and will give unto you reproach age-abiding,and disgrace age-abiding, which shall not be forgotten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
