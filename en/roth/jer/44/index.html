setting my face against you for calamity,even to cut off all Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I will take the remnant of Judah who did set their faces to enter the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, in the land of Egypt, shall they fall by the sword, by famine, shall they be consumed, from the least even unto the greatest, by sword and by famine, shall they die,so shall they become a curse, and an astonishment, and a contempt and a reproach;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and I will bring punishment upon them who are dwelling in the land of Egypt, just as I brought punishment upon Jerusalem,by sword, by famine and by pestilence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and there shall be neither escape nor survival, unto the remnant of Judah who have been entering, to sojourn there into the land of Egypt,that they should return to the land of Judah even when they are lifting up their soul to return to dwell there, for none shall return, saving fugitives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women standing by, a great convocation,with all the people who were dwelling in the land of Egypt in Pathros, made answer unto Jeremiah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As touching the word which thou hast spoken unto us, in the name of Yahweh we are not going to hearken unto thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but, we will certainly do, the whole thing that hath gone forth out of our own mouth, by burning incense to the queen of the heavens, and pouring out to her drink-offerings, just as we and our fathers, and our kings and our princes, did, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, then were we filled with bread and became prosperous, and calamity, saw we none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>whereas, from the very time we ceased burning incense to the queen of the heavens and pouring out to her drink-offerings, we have lacked everything,and by sword and by famine, have we been consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, though we are burning incense to the queen of the heavens and pouring out to her drink-offerings, is it, without our men that we have made to her sacrificial cakes as images of her and poured out to her, drink-offerings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then spake Jeremiah unto all the people,against the men and against the women, and against all the people who had been making any answer unto him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was it not, the very incense which ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land, was it not those very things, that Yahweh did remember, and that came up on his heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>so that Yahweh could no longer forbear because of the wickedness of your doings, because of the abominations which ye committed,and your land became a desolation, and an astonishment, and a contempt without inhabitantas at this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because that ye burned incense, and that ye sinned against Yahweh and hearkened not unto the voice of Yahweh, and, in his law and in his statutes and in his testimonies, did not walk, for this cause, did this calamity befall youas at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jeremiah said unto all the people, and unto all the women,Hear ye the word of Yahweh, all Judah, who are in the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives, have both spoken with your mouth and with your hands, have ye fulfilled saying, We will, certainly perform, our vows which we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her drink-offerings: the women will certainly confirm, your vows, and, certainly perform, your vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore, hear ye the word of Yahweh, all Judah, who are dwelling in the land of Egypt,Behold me! I have sworn by my great Name, Saith Yahweh, That my Name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah sayingBy the life of My Lord, Yahweh in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold me! watching over them for calamity, and not for blessing,so shall all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt, be consumed, by sword and by famine until there be an end of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet, the fugitives of the sword, shall certainly return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah men easily counted,that all the remnant of Judah who are entering Egypt to sojourn there, may know, whose word, shall stand, mine or theirs!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, this, to you, shall be the sign, Declareth Yahweh, that I am about to bring punishment upon you in this place,that ye may know that my words shall, certainly stand against you, for calamity:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus, saith Yahweh, Behold me! delivering up Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, yea into the hand of them who are seeking his life,just as I delivered Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon his enemy, and one seeking his life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
