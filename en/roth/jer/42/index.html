praying unto Yahweh your God according to your words,and it shall come to pass that the whole thing that Yahweh shall answer you, I will tell you, I will keep back from you, nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They, therefore said unto Jeremiah, Yahweh be against us, as a witness true and faithful,if according to all the word which Yahweh thy God shall send thee unto us, so we do not perform:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>whether for good or for ill, unto the voice of Yahweh our God for which we are sending thee unto him, will we hearken,to the end it may be well with us, because we will hearken unto the voice of Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass at the end of ten days, that the word of Yahweh came unto Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then called he for Johanan son of Kareah, and for all the princes of the forces who were with himand for all the people from the least even unto the greatest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and said unto them, Thus, saith Yahweh, God of Israelunto whom ye sent me, to cause your supplication to fall prostrate before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If ye will indeed abide, in this land, then will I build you up, and not pull   ,for I have compassion as touching the calamity which I have caused you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not fear the face of the king of Babylon, of whose face ye are afraid,do not fear him, Urgeth Yahweh, for with you, am I, to save you, and to deliver you out of his hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that I may grant you compassions and he may have compassion upon you,and suffer you to return unto your own soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But, since ye are saying,We will not dwell in this land,nor hearken unto the voice of Yahweh your God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying,No!
