Will one turn away, and not come back?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore hath this people of Jerusalem apostatized with an enduring apostacy,Taken fast hold of deceit, Refused to come back?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I hearkened and heardNot aright, did they speak,Not a man, repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done! They have every one, turned to their course again, Like a horse sweeping on through the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Even the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times, And the turtle and the swallow and the crane, observe the season for coming; But my people know not the just sentence of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How can ye say, Wise, are, we, And the law of Yahweh, is with us? But indeed lo! falsely, hath dealt the false pen of the scribes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ashamed are the wise, dismayed and captured! Lo! the word of Yahweh, have they rejected, And, what wisdom, have, they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, will I giveTheir wives to others, Their fields to such as shall take possession of them, For from the least, even unto the greatest, Every one, is, wholly given to extortion: From the prophet even unto the priest, Every one, dealeth, falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And so they have healed the grievous wound of the daughter of my people, slightly,Saying, Peace! peace! when there was no peace!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Were they led to turn pale because an abominable thing, they had done? Nay! they did not, at all turn pale Nay! they did not so much as know how to exhibit shame! Therefore, shall they fall among them who are falling, In the time when they are punished, shall they be overthrown, Saith Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will, surely remove, them, declareth Yahweh: There shall be no grapes on the vine Nor figs on the fig-tree, Even the leaf, hath faded, Though I have given them these things, they shall pass away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why are, well sitting still? Gather yourselves together and let us enter the defenced cities And let us be silent there,For, Yahweh our God, hath put us to silence And made us drink poisoned water, Because we have sinned against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A waiting For prosperity, but no welfare,For a time of healing, but lo! terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From Dan, was heard the snorting of his horses At the sound of the neighing of his chargers, the whole land trembled,Yea they came in and did sat up The land and the fulness thereof, The city, and them who were dwelling therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For behold me! sending among you serpentsvipers which there is no charming,And they shall fatally bite you declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I would have cheered myself against sorrow, Against me, mine own heart sickened:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lo! the voice of the cry for help of the daughter of my people from a land far away, Is, Yahweh, not in Zion? Is, her King, not within her? Why, have they provoked me with their carved images, with their foreign vanities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The harvest is passed, The fruit-gathering, is ended; And we are not saved!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the grievous injury of the daughter of my people, I am grievously injured,I am enshrouded in gloom, Horror, hath seized me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Balsam, is there none, in Gilead?
