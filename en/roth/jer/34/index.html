giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And, thou, shalt not escape out of his hand, For thou shalt be, taken, And into his hand, shalt thou be delivered,And, thine own eyes, into the eyes of the king of Babylon, shall look, And his mouth, with thy mouth, shall speak And Babylon, shalt thou enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless, hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah, king of Judah,Thus, saith Yahweh Concerning thee, Thou shalt not die, by the sword;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In peace, shalt thou die, And with the burnings made for thy fathers the former kings who were before thee, so, shall they make a burning unto thee, And, with an, Alas lord!
