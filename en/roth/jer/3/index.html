And, thou, hast been unchaste with many neighbours, and yet   to return unto me! Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights and seewhere thou hast not been unchastely embraced! beside the ways, hast thou sat to them, like the Arabian m the desert,and hast defiled the land with thine unchastities, and with thy wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore have been withholden the showers, And, the latter rain, hath not come,Yet the forehead of an unchaste woman, hast thou, Thou hast refused to be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hast thou not from this time, cried unto me, My father! the friend of my youth, art, thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will he maintain his anger to times age-abiding? Will he keep it perpetually? Lo! thou hast spoken thus but hast done wicked things and had thy way!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Yahweh said unto me, in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen what apostate Israel, did? She used to go upon every high mountain and beneath every green tree, and commit unchastity there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I said, after she had been doing all these things, Unto me, shall thou return? and she returned not,and her treacherous sister Judah saw it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though she saw that for all this, apostate Israel having committed adultery, I had sent her away, and had given a scroll of divorcement unto her, yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but, she also, went and committed unchastity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yea though it had come to pass that through the levity of her unchastity, she had defiled the land,and committed adultery with Stone and with Tree,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>yet, in spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah returned not unto me, with all her heart,but, falsely, Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Yahweh unto me,Apostate Israel, hath justified herself,more than treacherous Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go, and proclaim these words, towards the North and sayReturn! thou apostateIsrael, Urgeth Yahweh, I will not lower my face against you,for full of lovingkindness, I am, Declareth Yahweh, I will not maintain    unto times age-abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Only, acknowledge thine iniquity, that against Yahweh thy God, hast thou transgressed,and hast gone hither and thither unto foreigners under every green tree, and unto my voice, ye have not hearkened Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Return, ye apostate sons, Urgeth Yahweh, for, I, am become your husband,therefore will I take you one of a city, and two of a family, and will bring you to Zion;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and will give you shepherds according to mine own heart,who will feed you with knowledge and discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall come to pass when ye shall be multiplied and become fruitful in the land, in those days, Declareth Yahweh, They shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Neither shall it come up on the heart, Neither shall they remember it, Neither shall they miss it, Neither shall it be made any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At that time, shall they call Jerusalem, The throne of Yahweh, and there shall be gathered unto her all the nationsto the Name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem; and they shall walk no more after the stubbornness of their own wicked heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In those days, shall the house of Judah go unto the house of Israel,that they may enter together out of the land of the North, upon the land which I gave as an inheritance unto your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Though, I myself, had said,How can I put thee among the sons, And give thee a land to be coveted, An inheritance of beauty, of the hosts of nations? Yet I said, My father, shalt thou call me, And away from me, shalt thou not turn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But indeed   a wife goeth treacherously from her husband, so, have ye acted treacherously with me, O house of Israel, Declareth Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A voice on the bare heights, is heard, The weeping of the supplications of the sons of Israel,Because they have perverted their way, Have forgotten Yahweh their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Return ye apostate sons, I will heal your apostasies! Behold us! we have come unto thee, For thou, art Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Surely, to falsehood, pertain the hills The noisy throng on the mountains,Surely, in Yahweh our God, is the salvation of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, the Shameful thing, hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth: Their flocks, and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>We must lie down in our shame And our reproach, be our covering, For, against Yahweh our God, have we sinned, We and our fathers, from our youth even until this day,Neither have we hearkened unto the voice of Yahweh our God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
