Or the son of man, that thou shouldst put him in charge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou hast made him less, some little, than messengers, With glory and honour, hast thou crowned him, And hast set him over the works of thy hands ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All things, hast thou subjected beneath his feet. For, in subjecting,  to him  the all things, nothing, left he, to him unsubjected; But now, not yet, do we see, to him, the all things subjected;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But, Jesus, made some little less than messengers, we do behold: by reason of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, to the end that, by favour of God, in behalf of every one, he might taste of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was becoming in himFor the sake of whom are the all things, and by means of whom are the all things,when, many sons, unto glory, he would lead, The Princely Leader of their salvation, through sufferings, to make perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, both he that maketh holy, and they who are being made holy, are, all, of One; For which cause, he is not ashamed to be calling them, brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>sayingI will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of an assembly, will I sing praise unto thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and againI, will be confident upon him; and againLo! I, and the children which, unto me, God, hath given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seeing therefore the children have received a fellowship of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took partnership in the same,in order that, through death,he might paralyse him that held the dominion of death, that is, the Adversary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And might release theseas many as, by fear of death, were all their lifetime liable, to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, not surely of messengers, is he laying hold, but, of Abrahams seed, he is laying hold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Whence he was obliged, in every way, unto the brethren, to be made like, that he might become a merciful and faithful high-priest, in the things pertaining unto God,for the making of propitiation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, in that, he, suffered when tested, he is able, unto them who are being tested, to give succour.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
