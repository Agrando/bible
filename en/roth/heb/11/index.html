and, through it, though he died, he yet is speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>By faith, Enoch was translated, so as not to see death, and was not found, because that, God, had translated him; for, before the translation, he had received witness that he had become well-pleasing unto God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But, apart from faith, it is impossible to be well-pleasing; for he that approacheth unto Godmust needs have faith, that he is, and that, to them who seek him out, a rewarder he becometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith, Noah, having received intimation concerning the things not yet seen, filled with reverence, prepared an ark to the saving of his housethrough which he condemned the world, and, of the righteousness by way of faith, became heir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith, being called, Abraham obeyedto come forth into a place he was destined to receive for an inheritance; and he came forth, not well knowing whither he was coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith, he sojourned in the land of promise, as a foreign land, in tents, dwelling, along with Isaac and Jacob, the joint-heirs of the same promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he was awaiting the city having foundations, whose architect and builder is, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith, even Sarah herself, received power for founding a seed, even beyond the season of lifes prime,seeing that, faithful, she reckoned, him that had promised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore, even from one, were born, and, as to these things, one who had become dead,like the stars of the heaven, for multitude, and as the sand that is by the lip of the sea, that cannot be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In faith, all these diednot bearing away the promises, but, from afar, beholding and saluting them, and confessing that, strangers and sojourners, were they upon the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, they who such things as these are saying, make it clear that, of a paternal home they are in quest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, if indeed of that they had been mindful, from which they had come out, they might, in that case, have had an opportunity, to return;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, now, after a better one, are they reaching, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be invoked as, their God,for he hath prepared for them, a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith, Abraham, when tested, offered up Isaac, and, the only-begotten, would he have offered up, who the promises had accepted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even him of whom it had been saidIn Isaac, shall there be called to thee, a seed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Accounting that, even from among the dead, God, was able, to raise   ,whence, even in similitude, he bare him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith, even concerning things to come, did Isaac bless Jacob and Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith, Jacob, when about to die, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and bowed in worship on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith, Joseph, when drawing to his endconcerning the exodus of the sons of Israel, called to remembrance, and, concerning his bones, gave commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith, Moses, when bornwas hid three months by his parents, because, they saw, that, goodly, was, the child, and were not affrighted, at the decree of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith, Moses, when grown uprefused to be called the son of a daughter of a Pharaoh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Rather choosingto be jointly suffering ill-treatment with the people of God, than, for a season, to be having, sins enjoyment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Accountingas greater riches than Egypts treasures, the reproach of the Anointed One; for he was looking away unto the recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith, he forsook Egyptnot put in fear of the wrath of the king; for, as seeing him who cannot be seen, he persevered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith, he hath kept the passover and the besmearing of the blood, lest, he that was destroying the first-born, should be touching them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith, they passed through the Red Sea, as over dry land,which the Egyptians, seizing an attempt to do, were swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith, the walls of Jericho, fell, having been surrounded for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith, Rahab the harlot perished not with them who refused to yield, she having welcomed the spies with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more can I say? For, time, will fail me while I go on tellingconcerning Gideon, Barak, Sampson, Jephthah, David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who, through faithprevailed in contest over kingdoms, wrought righteousness, attained unto promises, shut the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouths of the sword, were made powerful from weakness, became mighty in battle, overturned, camps of aliens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received, by resurrection, their dead; but, others, were put to the rack, not accepting redemption, that, unto a better resurrection, they might attain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Others, again, of mockings and scourgings, received trial, nay! further, of bonds and imprisonments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, were pierced through, were sawn asunder, by murder, with a sword, died, went about in sheep-skins, in goat-hides,being in want, suffering tribulation, enduring ill-treatment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Of whom the world, was not worthyupon deserts, wandering, and mountains, and in caves,and in the caverns of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, these all, though they obtained witness through their faith, yet bare not away, the promise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God, for us, something better providing,that, not apart from us, should they be made, perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
