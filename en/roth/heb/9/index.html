but, the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, not into a Holy place made by hand, entered Christ,counterpart of the real   ; but, into the heaven itself, now, to be plainly manifested before the face of God in our behalf;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nor yet that, ofttimes, he should be offering himself,just as the high-priest entereth into the Holy place, year by year, with alien blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Else had it been needful for him, ofttimes, to suffer, from the foundation of the world; but, now, once for all, upon a conjunction of the ages, for a setting aside of sin through means of his sacrifice, hath he been made manifest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, inasmuch as it is in store for menonce for all to die, but after this, judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus, the Christ also, once for all having been offered, for the bearing of the sins, of many, a second time, apart from sin, will appear, to them who for him are ardently waitingunto salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
