I am come! to do, thy will:he taketh away the first, that, the second, he may establish:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By which will, we have been made holy, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, every priest, indeed, standeth daily publicly ministering, and the same sacrifices ofttimes offering, the which never can clear away sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But this priest, having offered one sacrifice for sins evermore, sat down on the right hand of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the rest, waitinguntil his foes be made his footstool;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, by one offering, hath he perfected for evermore, them who are being made holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But even the Holy Spirit beareth us witness; for, after having said</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the covenant which I will covenant unto them after these days, saith the Lord,Giving my laws upon their hearts, upon their understandings also, will I inscribe them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>of their sins, and of their lawlessnesses, I will in nowise be mindful any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, wherever a remission of these is, there is, no further, offering, for sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having therefore, brethren, freedom of speech for the entrance through the Holy place, by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Which entrance he hath consecrated for us, as a way recent and living, through the veil, that is, his flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having a great priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let us approach with a genuine heart, in full assurance of faith, having been sprinkled, as to our hearts, from an evil conscience, and bathed, as to our bodies, with pure water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the confession of the hope without wavering,for, faithful, is he that hath promised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let us attentively consider one another, to provoke unto love and noble works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, according to the custom of some, but exhorting, and by so much the more as this, by as much as ye behold, the day, drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For, if, by choice, we be sinning, after the receiving of the full-knowledge of the truth, no longer, for sins, is there left over, a sacrifice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But some fearful reception of judgment and fiery jealousy, about to devour the opposers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Any one having set aside a law of Moses, apart from compassions, upon   two or three witnesses, dieth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be accounted worthy, who hath trampled underfoot the Son of God, and, the blood of the covenant, hath esteemed, a profane thing, by which he had been made holy, and, unto the Spirit of favour, hath offered wanton insult?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know him that hath saidTo me, belongeth avenging, I, will recompense; and againThe Lord will judge his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>A fearful thing   to fall into the hands of a Living God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But be calling to mind the former days, in which, once ye were illuminated, a great combat of sufferings, ye endured;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Partly, indeed, because, both with reproaches and tribulations, ye were being made a spectacle, but, partly, because, into fellowship with them who were so involved, ye were brought;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For, even with them who were in bonds, ye sympathised, and, unto the seizure of your goods, with joy, ye bade welcome,knowing that ye have yourselves, for a better possession and an abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do not, then, cast away your freedom of speech,the which hath a great recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For, of endurance, ye have need, in order that, the will of God having done, Ye may bear away, the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For, yet a little while, how short! how short! The Coming One will be here, and will not tarry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But, my righteous one, by faith, shall live, and, if he draw back, my soul delighteth not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>We, however, are not of a drawing back unto destruction, but, of faith, unto an acquisition of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
