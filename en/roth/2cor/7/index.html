So that I the more rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because, if I even grieved you by the letter, I do not regret,though I could even have regretted,I see that that letter, if even for an hour, did cause you grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, am I rejoicing,not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved unto repentance; for ye were grieved according to God, in order that, in nothing, should ye receive damage from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, grief according to God, worketh, repentance unto salvation, not to be regretted; although, the grieving of the world, worketh, death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For lo! this very thingthe being caused to grieve, according to God:what manner of diligence it wrought out in you,nay! defence,nay! sore displeasure,nay! fear,nay! earnest desire,nay! jealousy,nay! avenging. In every way, ye shewed yourselves to be, chaste, in the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hence, if I even wrote unto you, it was not for the sake of him that did the wrong,  nay  not even for the sake of him that suffered the wrong; but for the sake of your earnestness, which was on our account, being made manifest unto you, before God:-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this cause, have we received encouragement. In addition to our encouragement, however, much more abundantly, have we rejoiced over the joy of Titus,that his spirit hath received refreshment from you all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That, if in anythingunto himin your behalfI have boasted, I have not been put to shame; but, as, all things, in truth, we told you, so, even our boasting before Titus, turned out to be, truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, his tender affections, are, much more abundantly towards you, when he calleth to mind the obedience, of you all,how, with fear and trembling, ye gave him welcome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice that, in everything, I am of good courage respecting you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
