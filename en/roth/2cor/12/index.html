Most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may spread a tent over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Wherefore, I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, and straits, in behalf of Christ; for, as soon as I am weak, then, am powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become foolish,ye, compelled me:I, in fact, ought, by you, to have been commended; for, not a whit, have I come behind the exceeding overmuch apostles,even if I am nothing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The signs, indeed, of an apostle, were wrought out among you, in all endurance, both  in signs, and wonders, and mighty works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies,save that, I myself, would not allow myself to be a burden unto you? Forgive me this wrong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Lo! this third time, I am holding myself, in readiness, to come unto you, and I will not allow myself to be a burden; for I seek not yours, but you;for, the children, ought not to lay up, for the parents, but the parents for the children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, I, most gladly, will spend, and be fully spent, for your souls:If I, exceedingly, love you, am I, the less, loved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But let it be!I, myself, did not burden you,Notwithstanding, being crafty, with guile, I caught you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Was there, anyone of those whom I have sent unto you, through whom I have overreached you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I exhorted Titus, and sent with him the brother,Did, Titus, overreach you? Was it not, in the same spirit, we walked? Was it not, in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All this time, think ye, that, unto you, we are making a defence? Before God in Christ, we speak;but all these things, beloved, for your upbuilding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fearlest, by any means, when I come, not such as I wish, should I find you, and, I, should be found by you, such as ye do not wish;lest, by any means,   strife, jealousy, outbursts of wrath, factions, railings, whisperings, puffed up pretensions, confusions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Lest, when I again come, my God should humble me in regard to you,and I should grieve over many who had before sinned, and not repented of the impurity, and fornication, and wantonness which they had committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
