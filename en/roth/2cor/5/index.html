So that, if any one is in Christ, there is a new creation! the old things, have passed away,Lo! they have become new!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The all things, moreover, are of God,who hath reconciled us unto himself, through Christ, and hath given, unto us, the reconciling ministry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How that, God, was in Christ, reconciling, a world, unto himself, not reckoning, unto them, their offences,and hath put, in us, the reconciling discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In behalf of Christ, therefore, are we ambassadors,as if God were beseeching through us: we entreat, in behalf of Christ,be reconciled unto God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Him who knew not sin, in our behalf, he made to be, sin, that we might become Gods righteousness in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
