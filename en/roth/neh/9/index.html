But, thou, art a God of forgivenesses, gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness, and didst not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, although they made them a molten calf, and said, This, is thy God, that brought thee up out of Egypt,and wrought great insults,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yet, thou, in thine abounding compassions, didst not forsake them in the desert,the pillar of cloud, departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to light up for them the way wherein they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, thy Good Spirit, thou gavest, to instruct them,and, thy manna, thou withheldest not from their mouth, and, water, thou gavest them, for their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, forty years, didst thou sustain them in the desert, they lacked nothing,their mantles, waxed not old and, their feet, swelled not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou gavest them kingdoms, and peoples, and allotted to each of them a corner,and they took possession of the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Their children also, didst thou multiply, like the stars of the heavens,and didst bring them into the land which thou hadst promised their fathers they should enter to possess;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>so the children entered and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and deliveredst them into their hand,with their kings, and the peoples of the land, to do with them according to their pleasure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and they captured fortified cities and a fat soil, and took possession of houses full of every good thing, wells digged, vineyards and oliveyards and fruit-trees, in abundance,so they did eat and were filled and became fat, and luxuriated in thy great goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But they murmured and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and, thy prophets, they slew, who testified against them that they might turn them back unto thee,and they wrought great insults.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore didst thou deliver them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them,and, in the time of their distress, they made outcry unto thee, and, thou, out of the heavens, didst hear, and, according to thine abounding compassions, gavest them saviors, that they might save them out of the hand of their adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, as soon as they had rest, they again wrought wickedness before thee,and thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies, who bare rule over them, yet, when they again made outcry unto thee, thou, from the heavens, didst hear and didst deliver them according to thy compassions, many times;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and didst testify against them, to bring them back unto thy law, yet, they, dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, and, against thy regulations, they sinned, the whichif any son of earth shall dothen shall he live by them,and yielded a rebellious shoulder, and, their neck, they stiffened, and hearkened not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou didst suffer many years to pass over them, and didst testify against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets, yet did they not give ear,therefore didst thou deliver them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet, in thine abounding compassions, thou didst not make of them an end, neither didst thou forsake them,for, a GOD gracious and full of compassion, thou art.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, therefore, O our Godthe GOD great, mighty, and fearfulkeeping the covenant and the lovingkindness, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, which hath come upon uson our kings, on our rulers, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people,from the days of the kings of Assyria, until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But, thou, art righteous, as to all that hath fallen upon us,for, faithfulness, hast thou wrought, whereas, we, have been lawless;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and, our kings, our rulers, our priests, and our fathers, have not kept thy law,nor given heed unto thy commandments, or unto thy testimonies, wherewith thou hast testified against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But, they, in their kingdom, and in thine abundant goodness which thou gavest them, and in the broad and fat land which thou didst set before them, did not serve thee, neither turned they from their wicked doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Lo! we, to-day, are bondmeneven upon the land which thou gavest our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, lo! we, are bondmen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and, the increase thereof, aboundeth unto the kings whom thou hast set over us, for our sins,and, over our bodies, are they bearing rule, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and, in great distress, we are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Seeing, therefore, all this, we, are plighting our faith, and putting it in writing,and, upon the sealed scroll, are our rulers, our Levites, our priests.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
