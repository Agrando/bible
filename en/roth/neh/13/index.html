So I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then, all Judah, brought in the tithe of corn, and new wine, and oil, unto the treasuries;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and I made treasurers over the treasuriesShelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from among the Levites, and, next unto them, Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah,for faithful were they accounted, and it was   upon them to distribute unto their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this,and do not wipe out my lovingkindnesses, which I have done for the house of my God, and for those keeping charge thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, saw I in Judahsome treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves and lading asses, moreover also wine, grapes, and figs, and every kind of burden, which they were bringing into Jerusalem on the sabbath day,so I protested against it, as a day for them to sell provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, men of Tyre, dwelt therein, who were bringing in fishand every kind of ware for sale,and were selling, on the sabbath, to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so I contended with the nobles of Judah,and said unto them, What is this wicked thing which, ye, are doing, and profaning the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was it not, thus, your fathers did, and our God brought upon us all this calamity, and upon this city?and, ye, would add indignation against Israel, by profaning the sabbath!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem made a shadow before the sabbath, then gave I word, and they shut the doors, and I gave word, that they should not open them, until after the sabbath,and, some of my young men, set I near the gates, so that no burden should be brought in, on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the traders and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore I testified against them, and said unto them, Wherefore are ye lodging against the wall? if ye do it again, a hand, will I thrust upon you,From that time, they came not on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I gave word to the Levites, that they should be purifying themselves and coming in, as keepers of the gates, to hallow the sabbath day. This also, remember to me, O my God, and have pity upon me, according to the abundance of thy lovingkindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover, in these days, saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and, their children, were one-half speaking the language of Ashdod, and understood not how to speak the language of the Jews,but after the tongue of both people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So I contended with them, and laid a curse upon them, and I smote, from among them, certain men, and pulled out their hair,and I put them on oath by God, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take of their daughters, for your sons nor for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Was it not, over these things, that Solomon king of Israel sinnedthough, among many nations, there was no king such as he, and he was, beloved by his God, and so God gave him to be king over all Israel,even him, did foreign women, cause to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Unto you, then, shall we hearken, to do all this great wickedness, to act unfaithfully with our God,by marrying foreign wives?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, one of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite,therefore I chased him from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Remember them, O my God,on account of the Defilings of the Priesthood, and the Covenant of the Priesthood, and of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So I purified them from everything foreign,and appointed charges unto the priests and unto the Levites, every one in his work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>also for the offering of wood, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
