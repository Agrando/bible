rejoiced,so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem was heard afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And there were sot in charge, on that day, certain men, over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, out of the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law, for the priests, and for the Levites,for, the joy of Judah, was over the priests and over the Levites, who were remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and   the singers and the doorkeepers,according to the commandment of David and his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For, in the days of David and Asaph, of old, there were chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving, unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now, all Israelin the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, used to give the portions of the singers and the doorkeepers, the need of a day upon its day,and they hallowed them unto the Levites, and, the Levites, hallowed them unto the sons of Aaron.</span>
