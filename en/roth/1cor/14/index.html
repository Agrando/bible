I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the mind,I will strike the strings with the spirit,  but  I will strike the strings also with the mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Else, if thou be blessing in a spirit, he that filleth up the place of the ungifted person, how shall he say the Amen upon thy thanksgiving? since indeed, what thou art saying, he knoweth not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, thou, indeed, excellently art giving thanks, but, the other, is not being built up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I give thanks unto God!More than ye all, am I speaking with tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, in assembly, I desire to speak five words with my mind, that, others also, I may instruct, than myriads of words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren! do not become children, in your understandings; but, in baseness, become babes, while, in your understandings, ye become, full-grown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law, it is writtenWith strange tongues, and with lips of strangers, will I speak unto this people; and, not even so, will they hearken unto me,saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that, the tongues, are for a signnot unto them that believe, but, unto them that believe not; whereas, prophesying, is not for them that believe not, but, for them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If, then, the whole assembly come together with one consent, and, all, are speaking with tongues,and there come in persons unskilled or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are raving?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, if, all, be prophesying,and there come in one who is unbelieving or unskilled, he is convicted by all, he is searched by all, the secrets of his heart, become manifest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, so, falling down upon his face, he will do homage unto God, reporting that, in reality, God is, among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What, then, is it, brethren? Whensoever ye are coming together, each one, hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath a translation:let, all things, be done, unto building up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If, with a tongue, one is speaking, let it be by two, or, at the most, three,and by turns; and let, one, be translating;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, if there be none to translate, let him keep silence in assembly, and, unto himself, be speaking, and, unto God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Prophets, moreover, let two or three speak, and let, the others, judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If, however, unto another, a revelation be made, as he is sitting, let the first be silent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For, one by one, ye can, all, be prophesying,that, all, may learn, and, all, be encouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, spirits of prophets, unto prophets, do submit themselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As for the women, in the assemblies, let them be silent, for it is not permitted them to be speaking; but let them be in submission,even as, the law, saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If, however, they are wishing to learn something, at home, their own husbands, let them question; for it is a shame for a woman to be speaking in assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or, from you, did the word of God come forth? Or, unto you alone, did it extend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge the things which I am writing to you,that they are, a commandment, of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But, if anyone knoweth not, he is unknown!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So, then, my brethren,be zealous to prophesy, and do not forbid, to be speaking with tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But let, all things, with comeliness, and by arrangement, be done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
