Am I not an apostle? Jesus our Lord, have I not seen? Are not, ye, my work, in the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If, unto others, I am not an apostle, certainly at least, unto you, I am; for, the seal of my apostleship, ye, are in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My defence, unto them who are examining me, is this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have we not a right to eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Have we not a right to take round, a sister wife,as even the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or have, only I and Barnabas, not a right to forbear working?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who serveth as a soldier, at his own charges, at any time? Who planteth a vineyard,and, the fruit thereof, doth not eat?  Or  who shepherdeth a flock,and, of the milk of the flock, doth not eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Is it, after the manner of men, that these things I am saying? Or doth not, even the law, the same things, say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, in the law of Moses, it is writtenThou shalt not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn:Is it, for the oxen, God is caring?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or, for our sakes altogether, is he saying it? For our sakes, it was written; because, he that ploweth, ought, to plow, in hope,and, he that thresheth,   in hope of partaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If, we, unto you, the things of the Spirit have sown, is it a great matter, if, we, of you, the things of the flesh shall reap?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If, others, of this right, over you, are partaking,   things, do we conceal,lest we should cause any hindrance unto the glad message of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Know ye not that, they who labour in the holy rites, do eat the provisions out of the holy place? They who at the altar wait, do, with the altar, share?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus, also, hath the Lord, appointedthat, they who the glad message tell, should, of the glad-message, live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, however, have not used any of these things; and have not written these things, in order that, so it should be done, in my case; for it were, good for me, rather to die thanmy boast, shall, no man, make void!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, if I be telling the glad-message, it is, with me, no matter of boasting; for, necessity, upon me, lieth,for it is, Woe to me, if I should not be telling the glad-message;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, if, by choice, this thing I am doing, I have, a reward; but, if not by choice, with a stewardship, have I been entrusted!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What, then, is my reward? that, in telling the glad-message, free of cost, I should put the glad-message,to the end I should not use to the full my right in the glad-message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, though free from all, unto all, myself, I enslaved,that, the larger number, I might win:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore became I, to the Jews, as, a Jew,that, Jews, I might win; to them who were under law, as, under law, not being, myself, under law,that, them who were under law, I might win;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To them who were without law, as, without law,not being without law to God, but lawfully subject to Christ,that I might win them who were without law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I became, unto the weak, weak,that, the weak, I might win;to all men, have I become all things, that, by all means, some, I might save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But, all things, am I doing, for the sake of the glad-message, that a joint-partaker thereof, I may become.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know ye not that, they who, in a racecourse, run, all, indeed, run,but, one, receiveth the prize?
