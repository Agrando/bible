If, the whole were, hearing, where were, the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, now, hath God set the members, each one of them in the body, even as he pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, if they all had been one member, Where had been, the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, however there are many members, yet one body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And  the eye cannot say unto the handI have no need of thee,nor, again, the head, unto the feetI have no need of you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nay! much more, the members which seem to be weaker are necessary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, the parts of the body which we deem to be less honourable, on these, more abundant honour, do we bestow, and, our uncomely parts, have, more abundant comeliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whereas, our comely parts, have, no need. But, God, hath tempered the body together,unto that which was lacking, giving more abundant honour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That there might be no division in the body, but that the members might have, the same, care, one for another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, whether one member, suffereth, all the members, suffer with it, or, a member is glorified, all the members, rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now, ye, are the body of Christ, and members severally;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God hath, indeed, set, certain, in the assembly,first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that mighty works, then gifts of healings, helps, guidings, kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles?
