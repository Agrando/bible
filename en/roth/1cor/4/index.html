Nay! I am not even examining myself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For, of nothing, to myself, am I conscious: nevertheless, not hereby, am I declared righteous, but, he that doth examine me, is the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So then, not before the fitting time, be judging anything,until the Lord shall come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and, then, the praise shall come to each one, from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But, these things, brethren, have I transferred unto myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that, in us, ye might learn</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou didst not receive? But, if thou didst even receive it, why dost thou boast, as though thou hadst not received it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Already, ye have become full, already, ye are become rich,apart from us, ye are become kings! And I would indeed ye had become kings, that, we also, with you, might have together become kings!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think that, God, hath set forth, us the apostles, to be last of all, as men devoted to death,in that, a spectacle, have we been made, unto the world,both unto messengers and unto men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We, are foolish for Christs sake, but, ye, prudent in Christ; we are weak, but, ye, mighty; ye, all-glorious, but, we, dishonoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Until the present hour, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and are wanderers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless, being persecuted, we hold on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Being defamed, we beseech: as the sweepings of the world have we become, the offscouring of alluntil even now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Not, to shame you, write I these things; but, as my beloved children, I admonish you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, though myriads of tutors ye should have in Christ, yet not many fathers; for, in Christ Jesus, through means of the joyful message, I, begat you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I beseech you, therefore,become imitators of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this cause, sent I unto you, Timothy,who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put, you, in mind of my ways which are in Christ  Jesus , even as, everywhere, in every assembly, I teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, as though I were not coming unto you, some are puffed up!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Howbeit, I will come quickly unto you,if, the Lord, please,and will get to knownot the speech of them who are puffed up, but, the power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For, not in speech, is the kingdom of God, but, in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What will ye? that, with a rod, I should come unto you? or, with love, and a spirit of meekness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
