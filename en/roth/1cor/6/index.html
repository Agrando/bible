And, if, by you, the world, is to be judged, unworthy are ye of the smallest judgment-seats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Know ye not that we shall judge, messengers? and not, then, matters of this life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If, then, for matters of this, life ye have judgment-seats, them who are of no account in the assembly, these, are ye seating thereupon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>With a view to shame you, am I speaking. So, is it possible that there is among younot so much as one wise man, who shall be able to judge between his brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But, brother with brother, sueth for judgment, and that before unbelievers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Already, indeed, it is an utter defeat for you, that ye are having, law-suits, one with another. Wherefore are ye not rather taking wrong? Wherefore are ye not rather suffering yourselves to be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nay! but, ye, are doing wrong, and defrauding,and that</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or know ye not that, wrong-doers, shall not inherit, Gods kingdom? Be not deceiving yourselves:neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionersshall inherit, Gods kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, these things, were some of you; but ye bathed them away,but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified, in the name of  our  Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things, unto me, are allowable, but, not all things, are profitable: all things, unto me, are allowable, but, I, will not be brought under authority by any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods; but, God, will set aside, both it and them. The body, however, is not for fornication, but, for the Lord,and, the Lord, for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>God, moreover, hath both raised up, the Lord, and will raise, us, up from among   through his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know ye not that, your bodies, are, members of Christ? Shall I, then, take away the members of the Christ and make them members of a harlot? Far be it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or know ye not that, he that joineth himself unto the harlot, is, one body? For, saith he, the two, shall become, one flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, he that joineth himself unto the Lord, is, one Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication! Every sin, whatsoever a man shall commit, is, outside his body, but, he that committeth fornication, bringeth sin into his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or know ye not that, your body, is, a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you, which ye have from God? And ye are not your own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye have been bought with a price! Therefore glorify God in your body.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
