But, whensoever it shall be saidall things are in subjection!it is evident that it means,Except him who did put into subjection, unto him, the all things</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But whensoever have been put into subjection, unto him, the all things, then, the Son himself,  also  shall be put in subjection unto him who put in subjection, unto him, the all things,that, God, may be, all things in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Else, what will they do, who are being immersed in behalf of the dead? If, not at all, are the dead to be raised, why are they even being immersed in their behalf?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Why also are, we, running into peril every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Day by day, am I dying!Yea! by your own boasting, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If, after the manner of men, I have fought with wild-beasts at Ephesus, what, to me, the profit? If the dead are not raised, Let us eat and drink, for, tomorrow, we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be not deceiving yourselves,evil communications corrupt gentle manners:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wake up to sobriety, in righteousness, and be not committing sin; for some have, an ignorance of God: for shame, unto you, am I speaking!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will sayHow, are the dead raised? and, with what kind of body, do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simple one! What, thou, sowest, is not quickened, except it die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, what thou sowest, not the body that shall come into existence, dost thou sow, but a naked kernelif it so happen, of wheat, or of any of the rest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Howbeit, God, giveth it a body, as he pleased, and, unto each of the seeds, a body of its own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Not all flesh, is the same flesh; but, one, indeed, is,   of men, and, another, the flesh of beasts, and, another, the flesh of birds, and, another, of fishes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies,but, of one kind, indeed, is the glory of the heavenly, and, of another kind, is the glory of the earthly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>One, is the glory of a sun, and, another, the glory of a moon, and, another, the glory of stars,nay! star from star, differeth in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Thus, also the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory, it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a body of the soul, it is raised a body of the spirit; if there is a body of the soul, there is also of the spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thus, also, it is writtenThe first man, Adam, became, a living soul, the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Howbeit, not first, is the   of the spirit, but that, of the soul,afterwards, that of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man, is of the ground, earthy, the second man, is, of heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As, the man of earth, such, also, the men of earth, and, as, the man of heaven, such, also, the men of heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And, even as we have borne the image of the man of earth, let us also bear the image of the man of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And, this, I say, brethren,that, flesh and blood, cannot inherit, Gods kingdom. Neither doth, corruption, inherit, incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Lo! a sacred secret, unto you, do I declare:we shall not, all, sleep, but we shall, all, be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, during the last trumpet; for it shall sound, and, the dead, shall be raised, incorruptible, and, we, shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible must needs clothe itself with incorruptibility, and this mortal, clothe itself, with immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But, whensoever, this mortal, shall clothe itself with immortality, then, shall be brought to pass the saying that is writtenDeath hath been swallowed up, victoriously;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Where, O death, is thy victory? Where, O death, is thy sting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Now, the sting of death, is, sin, and, the power of sin, is, the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But, unto God, be thanks, who is giving unto us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>So, then, my beloved brethren,become ye, steadfast, immovable, superabounding in the work of the Lord, at all times; knowing that, your toil, is not in vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
