What am I to say to you? Shall I praise you? In this, I praise you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, I myself, received from the Lordthat which I also delivered unto you,how that, the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was being delivered up, took a loaf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, giving thanks, brake it, and saidThis, is my body, which is for you,this, do ye, in remembrance of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same manner, the cup also, after they had taken supper, sayingThis cup, is, the new covenant in my blood, this, do ye, as often soever as ye may be drinking it, in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For, as often as ye may be eating this loaf, and, the cup, may be drinking, The death of the Lord, do ye announce, until he come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So that, whosoever may be eating the loaf, or drinking the cup of the Lord, in an unworthy manner, shall be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man be proving himself,and, so, of the loaf, let him eat, and, of the cup, let him drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, he that is eating and drinking,judgment unto himself, doth eat and drink,if he be not setting apart the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause, many among you are weak and sickly; and, not a few, are falling asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If, however, we had been setting, ourselves, apart, we had not, in that case, been coming under judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But, being brought under judgment, by the Lord, are we being disciplined, lest, with the world, we should be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then, my brethren,when ye come together for the eating, unto one another, be giving welcome:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If anyone be hungry, at home, let him eat, lest, unto judgment, ye be coming together. And, the remaining things, whensoever I come, I will set in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
