Have I, yet, sons in my womb, that they should become your, husbands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband,If I should say, I have, hope, if I should, even to-night have a husband, and should, even bear sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>would ye, therefore, tarry until they were grown? would ye, therefore, shut yourselves up from having husbands? Nay! my daughters, for it is far more bitter for me than for you, that forth hath gone against me, the hand of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they lifted up their voice and wept, yet more. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in- law, but, Ruth, clave unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she saidLo! thy sister-in-law hath gone back, unto her people, and unto her gods,go thou back, after thy sister-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ruth saidDo not urge me to leave thee, to go back from following thee,for, whither thou goest, I will go, and, where thou lodgest, I will lodge, thy people, shall be my people, and, thy God, my God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>where thou diest, I will die, and, there, will I be buried: So, let Yahweh do to me, and, so, let him add, if, death itself, part me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, when she saw that, bravely determined, was she to go with her, she ceased entreating her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So, they two, went their way, until they entered Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they entered Bethlehem, that all the city was moved concerning them, and the women saidIs this Naomi?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she said unto them, Do not call me Naomi,call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me: \fs15</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I was full when I departed, but, empty, am I brought back of Yahweh,wherefore should ye call me Naomi, when, Yahweh, hath given answer against me, and, the Almighty, hath crushed me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab,and, they, entered Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
