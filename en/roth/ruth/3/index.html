Lo! he is winnowing the barley threshing-floor, to-night!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou wilt, therefore, bathe thee, and anoint thee, and put thine apparel upon thee, and go down to the threshing-floor,do not make thyself known to the man, until he have done eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he doth lie, and shalt go in and turn aside the covering of his feet, and lay thee down,and, he, will tell thee what thou shalt do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she said unto her,All that thou sayest, will I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So she went down to the threshing-floor,and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, when Boaz had eaten, and drunk, and his heart was glad, he went in to lie down at the end of the heap of corn. Then came she in softly, and turned aside the covering of his feet, and laid her down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, in the middle of the night, that the man started up, and turned,and lo! a woman, lying at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Who art, thou? And she said, I, am Ruth, thy handmaid, spread, therefore, thy wing over thy handmaid, for, a kinsman, thou art.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saidBlessed, be thou of Yahweh, my daughter, for thou hast made thy last lovingkindness better than the first,in not following after young men, whether poor, or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, therefore, my daughter, do not fear, whatsoever thou shalt say, I will do for thee,for all the gate of my people doth know, that, a virtuous woman, thou art.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, now, although it is true that, a kinsman, am I, yet is there a kinsman nearer than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Tarry the night, and it shall be, in the morning, if he will act as kinsman to thee, well, let him so act, but, if he inclineth not to act as kinsman to thee, then will, I, so act to theeby the life of Yahweh,Lie still, until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So she lay at his feet, until the morning, and rose up before one could know his neighbour.
