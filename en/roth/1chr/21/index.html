And, the messenger of Yahweh, was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, when David lifted up his eyes, and saw the messenger of Yahweh, standing, between the earth and the heavens, and his sword drawn, in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem, then fell David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, upon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said unto God, Was it not, I, who gave word to number the people? Yea, I, it was who sinned and did the great wrong, what then had, these sheep, done? O Yahweh, my God, let thy hand, I beseech thee, be against me, and against the house of my father, but not against, thy people, that they should be plagued!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, the messenger of Yahweh, commanded Gad, to say unto David,that David should go up, to rear an altar unto Yahweh, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spake in the name of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ornan turned, and saw the messenger, but, his four sons with him, were hiding themselves,now, Ornan, had been threshing wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then came David unto Ornan,and Ornan looked, and saw David, and went forth out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself unto David, with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said unto Ornan, Grant me the place of the threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar, unto Yahweh,for silver in full, shalt thou grant it me, that the plague may be stayed from off the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do what is good in his own eyes,see! I have given the oxen for ascending-sacrifices, and, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for a meal-offering,the whole, have I given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said King David to Ornan, Nay! but I will, surely buy, it for silver in full,for I will not take that which is thine for Yahweh, nor offer an ascending-sacrifice that hath cost me nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David gave to Ornan, for the place,shekels of gold, by weight, six hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David built there an altar unto Yahweh, and caused to go up ascending-sacrifices, and peace-offerings,and called unto Yahweh, and he responded to him, by fire, out of the heavens, upon the altar of ascending-sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Yahweh gave word to tile messenger, and he put back his sword into its sheath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But, the habitation of Yahweh, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of ascending-sacrifice, were, at that time, in the high place at Gibeon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and David could not go before it, to seek God,for he had been terrified, because of the sword of the messenger of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
