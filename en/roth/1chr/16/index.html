brought in the ark of God, and placed it in the midst of the tent, which David had pitched for it,and they brought near ascending-sacrifices and peace-offerings, before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And, when David had made an end of offering the ascending-sacrifices, and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people, in the name of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he apportioned, to every one of Israel, both man and woman,to every one, a loaf of bread, and a sweet drink, and a raisin cake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he placed before the ark of Yahweh certain of the Levites, as attendants,and to celebrate, and to give thanks and render praise, unto Yahweh, God of Israel;</span> <span
