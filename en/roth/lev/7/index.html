shall eat thereof, shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, the flesh that toucheth anything unclean, shall not be eaten, in fire, shall it be consumed,but, as for the   flesh, any one who is clean, may eat flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But as for the person who shall eat flesh from the peace-offering, which pertaineth unto Yahweh, while

uncleanthe uncleanness of man or an unclean beast, or any unclean disgusting thing,and then eateth of the flesh of a peace-offering that pertaineth unto Yahweh, then shall that person be cut off from among his kinsfolk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying,No fat, of ox or sheep or goat, shall ye eat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and though the fat of what dieth of itself and the fat of that which has been torn in pieces, may be used for any other service, yet shall ye, in nowise eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nay, as touching any one who eateth the fat of any beast, wherefrom he might bring near an altar-flame unto Yahweh, then shall the person that eateth be cut off from among his kinsfolk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And no manner of blood, shall ye eat, in any of your dwellings,whether of bird or of beast:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>as touching any person who eateth any manner of blood, then shall that person be cut off from among his kinsfolk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Speak unto the sons of Israel saying,He that offereth his peace-offering unto Yahweh, shall bring in his own oblation unto Yahweh out of his peace-offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>his own hands shall bring in the altar-flames of Yahweh,the fat with the breast, he shall bring it in, the breast, to wave it as a wave-offering before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then shall the priest make a perfume with the fat at the altar,and the breast shall be for Aaron and for his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But, the right shoulder, shall ye give as a heave-offering, unto the priest,from among your peace-offerings</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he that bringeth near the blood of the peace-offerings and the fat from among the sons of Aaron, to him, shall belong the right shoulder for a portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For, the wave-breast and the heave-shoulder, have I taken of the sons of Israel, out of their peace-offerings,and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as an age-abiding statute, from the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This, is what pertaineth to the anointing of Aaron and to the anointing of his sons out of the altar-flames of Yahweh,  in the day when he brought them near, to minister as priests unto Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>which Yahweh commanded to give them in the day when he anointed them, from among the sons of Israel,an age-abiding statute to their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is the lawfor the ascending-sacrifice, for the meal-offering, and for the sin-bearer, and for the guilt-bearer,and for the installation-offerings, and for the peace-offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai,in the day when he commanded the sons of Israel to bring near their oblations unto Yahweh in the desert of Sinai.</span>
