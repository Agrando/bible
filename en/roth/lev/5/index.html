man, as regardeth any uncleanness of his, wherewith one may become unclean,and it be hidden from him, and then he himself, getting to know it becometh aware of his guilt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or, any person, whensoever he shall swear, speaking unadvisedly with the lips, to harm or to help, as regardeth anything wherein the son of earth may speak unadvisedly by way of oath, and it be hidden from him,and then, he himself, getting to know it, becometh aware of his guilt as regardeth any one of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then shall it be, when he becometh aware of his guilt, as regardeth any one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and shall bring in as his
