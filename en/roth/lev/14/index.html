class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>then shall the priest go forth unto the outside of the camp,and the priest shall take a view, and lo! if the plague of leprosy hath been healed out of the leper,;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>then shall the priest give command,and there shall be takenfor him that is to be cleansedtwo living clean birds,and cedar wood, and crimson am hyssop;</span> <span

hand, shall he put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed,to put a propitiatory-covering over him before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then shall he offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons,of that for which his hand hath enough;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>even that for which his hand hath enough,the one as a sin-bearer and the other as an ascending-sacrifice, upon the meal-offering,so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him that is to be cleansed before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is the law for him in whom hath been the plague of leprosy, whose hand hath not enough for that which pertaineth to his cleansing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Yahweh spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When ye enter into the land of Canaan which I am about to give you for a possession,and I put a plague-mark of leprosy in a house, of the land of your possession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>then shall he that owneth the house come in, and tell the priest, saying,A kind of plague-mark, appeareth to me in the house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and the priest shall give command, and they shall empty the house, ere yet the priest cometh in to view the mark, so that he do not pronounce unclean all that is in the house,and, after this, shall the priest come in to view the house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>then shall he view the mark and lo! if the mark is in the walls of the house, with sunken places greenish yellow or reddish,and they appear to be lower than the   wall,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>then shall the priest come forth out of the house, unto the entrance of the house,and shall shut up the house seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the priest shall return on the seventh day,and take a view, and lo! if the mark hath spread in the walls of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>then shall the priest give command, and they shall pull out the stones, wherein is the mark,and cast them forth outside the city, into an unclean place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and, the house itself, shall he cause to be scraped on the inside round about,and they shall pour out the mortar which they have scraped off, outside the city, into an unclean place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and shall take other stones, and put in the place of the stones,and, other mortar, shall he take and plaster the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But if the mark again breaketh out in the house, after the taking out of the stones,and after the scraping of the house and after the plastering,;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>then shall the priest come in, and take a view, and lo! if the mark hath spread in the house, a fretting leprosy, it is in the house unclean, it is,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and he shall pull down the house,the stones thereof, and the timber thereof and all the mortar of the house,and shall carry them forth outside the city, into an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And as for him that entereth into the house, all the days it is shut up, he shall be unclean until the evening;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And, he that lieth in the house, shall wash his clothes, and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But, though the priest do come, into the house, and take a view, yet lo! if the plague-mark hath not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then shall the priest pronounce the house clean, for, healed, is the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then shall he take to cleanse, the house, two birds,and cedar wood, and crimson, and hyssop;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and shall kill one bird,within an earthen vessel over living water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and take the cedar wood and the hyssop, and the crimson and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the living water,and sprinkle the house seven times;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and so cleanse the house, with the blood of the bird and with the living water,and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop, and with the crimson;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and shall let go the living bird unto the outside of the city, unto the face of the field,so shall he put a propitiatory-covering over the house and it shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This, is the law,for every plague-mark of leprosy and for scall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and for garment leprosy, and for house   ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and for rising, and for scab and for a bright spot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>to give instruction, on the day of declaring unclean, and on the day of declaring clean,This is the law of leprosy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
