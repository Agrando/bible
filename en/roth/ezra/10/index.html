had prayed and when he had made confession, weeping and casting himself down, before the house of God, there gathered unto him out of Israel, an exceeding large convocationmen and women and children, for the people wept with a very bitter weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then responded Shecaniah son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam, and said unto Ezra, We, have been faithful with our God, and have married foreign women from among the peoples of the land,yet, now, there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now, therefore, let us solemnize a covenant unto our Godto put away all the women and such as have been born of them, in the counsel of my lord, and them who tremble at the commandment of our God,and, according to the law, let it be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Arise, for, upon thee, resteth the thing, but, we, are with thee,be strong, and act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then arose Ezra and made the rulers of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, swear to do according to this wordand they sware.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then arose Ezra from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib,and, when he came thither, bread, did he not eat, and, water, did he not drink, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of them of the Exile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then made they a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem, unto all the Sons of the Exile, to gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and, whosoever should not come within three days, according to the counsel of the rulers and the elders, all his goods should be devoted,and, himself, be separated from the convocation of them of the Exile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then were gathered together all the men of Judah and Benjamin unto Jerusalem, within three days, the same, was the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month,and all the people remained in the broadway of the house of God, trembling concerning the thing, and because of the heavy rains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then arose Ezra the priest, and said unto them, Ye, have acted unfaithfully, and have married foreign women,to add unto the guilt of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, therefore, make confession unto Yahweh God of your fathers, and do his pleasure,and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then responded all the convocation and said, with a loud voice,Thus, according to thy word concerning us, must it be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless, the people, are many, and, the season, is that of the heavy rains, and we are not able to stand outside,and, the business, is not one for a single day, nor yet for two, for we have abundantly transgressed, in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let, we beseech thee, our rulers take up their station for all the convocation, and, all who, throughout our cities, have married foreign women, let them come in at times appointed, and, with them, the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the glow of the anger of our God be turned from us, concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, made a stand against this,and, Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, helped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the Sons of the Exile, did thus, and Ezra the priest separated to himself certain menancestral heads by their ancestral houses, and all of them by name,and they took their seats on the first day of the tenth month to search into the matter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they made an end
