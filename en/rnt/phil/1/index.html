Still in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed and in that I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this will make for my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope that I may be put to shame in nothing, but with all courage, as always, so now Christ may be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful work for me. I know not which to choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am under pressure both ways, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it is far better,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>yet that I should stay in the flesh is more needful on your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this I confidently know, that I shall stay and stay near you all for your advancement and joy of faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that your exultation in Christ Jesus may overflow on my account, because of my presence again with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only exercise your citizenship in a manner worthy of the good news of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or in absence hear news of you, I may know that you are standing in one spirit, with one mind wrestling in the faith of the good news</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and not frightened in anything by your adversaries, which for them is a sign of ruin, but for you of salvation, and that from God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>because it has been graciously allowed you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for his sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and you have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear of in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
