Again I say rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let your fairness be known to all men. The Lord is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not worry, but in everything by prayer and entreaty with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the peace of God which passes all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>To conclude, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is dignified, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovable, whatever is highly spoken of \'97 if there is any virtue or any praise \'97 think of that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What you learned and accepted and heard and saw in me \'97 practice that. And the God of peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length your thoughtfulness for me had revived. You were thoughtful for me all along, but lacked opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I am speaking because of want; for I have learned how to be content in whatever circumstances I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know how to live humbly and I know how to enjoy abundance. In each and every situation I have been initiated into the secret both of being well fed and of going hungry, both of having abundance and of bearing want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I can do all things through him who gives me strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet you did nobly in sharing with me in my distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You Philippians know that at the beginning of the good news, when I came away from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and that in Thessalonica you sent once, yes, twice, for my need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not that I am seeking for the gift, but I am seeking for the fruit that increases to your credit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have enough of everything and more than enough. I am fully supplied since receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My God will supply every need of yours according to his wealth in glory in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To God our Father be glory for the ages of the ages!
