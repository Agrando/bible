For many false prophets have come out into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>By this we know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and no spirit that does not confess Jesus is from God. This is the spirit of Antichrist, which you have heard is coming into the world and is already in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But you are of God, little children, and have conquered them, because he who is in us is greater than he who is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They belong to the world and for that reason they speak as the world speaks and the world listens to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us: whoever is not of God does not listen to us. In this way we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and every one who loves has been born of God and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who does not love does not know God; for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By this the love of God to us was made plain: that God sent his only Son into the world so that we may have life through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love \'97 not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God has so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has ever seen God. If we love one another God abides in us and his love is made perfect in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has imparted to us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We have seen and we bear witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We have come to know and have put our trust in the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God and God remains in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus love has been made perfect with us so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because as God is we also are in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has pain. He who fears has not been made perfect in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If any one says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This command we have from him, that he who loves God shall love his brother also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
