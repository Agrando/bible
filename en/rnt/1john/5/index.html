And his commands are not burden-some,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because all that is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is the conqueror of the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is he who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ.
