Even if any one sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he is an atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but for those of the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He who says, "I know him," and does not keep his commands, is a liar and truth is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God has been made perfect. By this we know that we are in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who says that he is abiding in him ought himself to live as he lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, I am not writing a new command for you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. The old command is the message that you have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again I am writing a new command, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who says that he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves his brother remains in the light and there is no stumbling block in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and knows not where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven for his name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have conquered the Evil One. I have written to you, little children, because you have come to know the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have written to you, fathers, because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and the message of God remains in you and you have conquered the Evil One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do not love the world nor the things that are in the world. If any one loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for all that is in the world, the passions of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the show and pride of life, is not from the Father, but from the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the world is passing away with its passions. But he who does the will of God endures forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that Antichrist is coming, even now many Antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the last hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us they would have continued with us. But they went out so that it might be plainly seen that not all are of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You have an anointing from the Holy One and you all know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it and know that no lie is from the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is the Antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>No one who denies the Son has the Father either. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the promise that he has promised us \'97 the life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am writing this to you in regard to those who are misleading you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But as for you, the anointing that you have received from him remains in you and you have no need for any one to teach you, but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is no lie and as it has taught you, you must remain in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, little children, remain in him so that if he appears we may have confidence and not shrink in shame from him at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one who does righteousness has been born of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
