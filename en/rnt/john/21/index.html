He showed himself in this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee and two other disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said, "We will go along with you." They went out and got into a boat, but that night they caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples, however, did not recognize that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?" They answered him, "No."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." They cast, and now they could not draw it in for the multitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Master!" Simon Peter, on hearing that it was the Master, girded around him his blouse, for he was naked, and threw himself into the lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from land \'97 about a hundred yards \'97 dragging the netful of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they had gotten out on land, they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish that you have just caught."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter got into the boat and drew the net to land full of big fishes \'97 a hundred and fifty-three \'97 and though there were so many the net was not torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus said, "Come, take break-fast." No one of the disciples dared to ask him who he was, knowing that it was the Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus came and took bread and gave to them, and fish in the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after rising from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Master, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Master, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Shepherd my sheep."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Master, you know all things. You know that I love you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you girded yourself and walked about wherever you wished. When you are old, you will stretch out your hands and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This he said, indicating the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After saying this he said to him, "Follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, following.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "Master, what shall this man do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, "If I choose to have him stay until I come, what is that to you? You must follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the report went out among the brethren that that disciple was not to die. But Jesus did not say to Peter that he would not die, but, "If I choose to have him stay until I come, what is that to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple who witnesses to these things and who wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There are also many other things that Jesus did, but if these are written, every one, I do not think that the world itself will have room for the books when written.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
