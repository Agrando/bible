Peter said to him, "Master, are you washing my feet?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered him, "What I am doing you do not know now; but you will know hereafter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to him, "You shall never wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to him, "Master, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to him, "He who has bathed has no need to be washed, except his feet, but is all clean. And you are clean, though not all."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew the one who was going to betray him. For this reason he said, "You are not all clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he had washed their feet and had taken his upper garments and lain down again, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me Teacher and Master and you say rightly, for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If then I, the Master and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example that you may do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, the servant is not superior to his master nor the messenger superior to him who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you know these things, blessed are you \'97 if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am not speaking of all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who is eating my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am now telling you before it occurs that when it does occur you may believe that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, he who receives any one whom I send receives me. He who receives me receives him who sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After saying these things Jesus was disturbed in spirit and solemnly said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples looked at one another wondering whom he meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One of his disciples was leaning on Jesus' breast \'97 the one Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter nodded to him and said, "Say who it is that he is speaking of."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, said to him, "Master, who is it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, "I will dip a piece of bread and give it to one. That is the man." When he had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After the piece of bread Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, "What you are doing do quickly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>No one of those reclining at the table understood why he said this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Some thought, since Judas had the purse, that Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the feast," or to give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>After taking the morsel Judas immediately went out. It was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When Judas had gone, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has been glorified and God has been glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and immediately will glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Children, yet a little while I am with you. You will look for me and, as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going you cannot come,' so I say now to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new command I give you, to love one another, as I have loved you \'97 that so you love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love to one another."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to him, "Master, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you will follow me later."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to him, "Master, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I tell you, the cock will not crow before you have disowned me three times."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
