But the sheep did not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the gate: if any one enters through me he will be saved, and will go in and go out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The hireling, who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, looks on as the wolf comes and leaves the sheep and runs away \'97 and the wolf seizes them and scatters them \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>because he is a hireling and does not care for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd, and I know mine and mine know me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life to take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down and have power to take it again. This command I received from my Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was again a division among the Jews, on account of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, "These words are not those of a demoniac. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came the Feast of Renovation in Jerusalem. It was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus was walking in the Temple courts, in Solomon's Colonnade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Jews came in a circle around him and said to him, "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us frankly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, "I have told you and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name \'97 these witness for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you do not believe because you are not of my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep listen to my voice and I know them and they follow me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I give to them life eternal, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father who gave them to me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and my Father are one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Again the Jews took up stones to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, "Many good works I have shown you from my Father. For which of these works are you stoning me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, "For a good work we are not stoning you, but for profane words, because you, a man, are making yourself God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I said you are Gods'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called those to whom the word of God came Gods \'97 and the authority of Scripture cannot be denied \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you say to him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, 'You speak profane words,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>if I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do, even though you do not believe me, believe the works; that you may perceive and know that the Father is in me and that I am in the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was at first when he was baptizing, and he stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Many came to him and they said, "John did no sign; but all that John said about this man was true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Many believed in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
