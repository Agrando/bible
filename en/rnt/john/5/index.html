Around it are five colonnades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In these lay a multitude of invalids \'97 blind, lame, withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There was a man there who had had an infirmity thirty-eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus saw this man lying there and perceiving that he had been there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to get well?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The sick man answered him, "I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled. While I am coming, some other man gets down before me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your pallet and walk."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>At once the man became well and took up his pallet and began walking. That day was the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Jews said to the man who had been cured, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not proper for you to carry your pallet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he answered them, "He who made me well \'97 he told me, 'Take up your pallet and walk.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They asked him, "Who is the man that told you, 'Take it up and walk'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The cured man did not know who it was. For Jesus had taken himself away, a crowd being in that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterwards Jesus found him in the Temple court and said to him, "See, you have become well. Sin no more, for something worse might happen to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the man who had made him well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>On this account the Jews persecuted Jesus because he did such things on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and I am working."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On this account the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only kept breaking the Sabbath, but even spoke of God as his own Father, making himself equal with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever things he does, those the Son does likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son and shows him what he is doing, and he will show him greater works than these that you may wonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither does the Father judge any one, but he has committed all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has life eternal and does not come into condemnation, but has passed over from death into life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly, truly, I tell you that the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He has given him authority to do judgment, because he is Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do not wonder at this, because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and will come forth \'97 those who have done good to a resurrection of life and those who have done evil to a resurrection of condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"I cannot of myself do anything. As I hear I judge and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I testify regarding myself, my testimony is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another who testifies regarding me and I know that the testimony that he bears regarding me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You sent to John and he testified to the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>still I do not obtain my testimony from a man, but I say this that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was the burning and shining light and you were willing to rejoice for an hour in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have testimony greater than John's. For the works which the Father has granted to me to accomplish \'97 the very works that I do \'97 witness for me that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The Father who sent me \'97 he has witnessed regarding me. You have neither heard his voice nor seen his form,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and you have not his word abiding in you; because you do not believe him whom he has sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You search the Scriptures because you think that you have in them life eternal, and it is they that testify of me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and yet you will not come to me to have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I do not accept honor from men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but I know that you have not the love of God within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in the name of my Father and you do not accept me. If another comes in his own name, you will accept him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe, you who accept honor from one another and do not seek honor from the only God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. You have an accuser, Moses in whom you trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
