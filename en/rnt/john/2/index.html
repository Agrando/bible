My hour has not yet come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he tells you, do it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There were standing there six stone water jars in accordance with the Jewish custom of purification, holding about twenty or thirty gallons apiece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." They filled them to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to them, "Dip out now and carry it to the Master of the feast." They carried it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and when the Master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, not knowing where it came from \'97 though the servants who had dipped out the water knew \'97 he called to the bridegroom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to him, "Every man sets on first the fine wine, and when they have drunk freely he sets on the poorer. You have kept the fine wine till now."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana in Galilee and displayed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this Jesus went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and there they stayed a few days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Finding in the Temple courts the sellers of cattle and sheep and doves and the money-changers sitting there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>he made a whip of cords and drove them all from the courts \'97 all the sheep and the cattle, \'97 and he poured out the small coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to those who were selling doves, "Take these things out. Do not make my Father's house a house of trade."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for thy house will devour me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews said to him, "What sign do you show us, since you act in this way?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered them, "Demolish this Temple and in three days I will raise it again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jews said, "It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and will you raise it in three days?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he was speaking of the temple of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So when he arose from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he was in Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, seeing his signs that he did,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but Jesus did not trust himself to them because he knew all men</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and had no need for any one to inform him about man, for he knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
