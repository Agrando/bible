Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the high priests and their subordinates saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said, "You take him and crucify him. For I find no crime in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered, "We have a law and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilate heard that, he was more alarmed</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and went into the Castle and said to Jesus, "Where do you come from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pilate said to him, "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, "You would not have any authority over me if it were not given you from above. For this reason he who delivered me to you has a greater sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this, Pilate kept trying to release him, but the Jews shouted, "If you let this man go you are not a friend of Caesar. Every one who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate, on hearing these words, brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat in the place called the Mosaic Pavement \'97 in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It was the Preparation Day of the Passover, about noon. He said to the Jews, "See your king!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They shouted, "Away with him, away with him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your king?" The high priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and laid on him his cross and went out to what is called Skull Place \'97 in Hebrew, Golgotha \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified him. And with him they crucified two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pilate wrote a sign and put it up on the cross. It was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes and made four parts, a part to each soldier, and there was his tunic besides. The tunic was seamless, woven from the top entire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots who shall have it." This was so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "They parted my garments among them and on my clothing they cast lots." The soldiers did this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There were standing beside the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, "Woman, there is your son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to the disciple, "There is your mother." From that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus knowing that now all things had been completed, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled said, "I am thirsty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A pitcher was standing there full of sour wine. Putting a sponge full of sour wine on a hyssop stem, they raised it to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, "It is finished," and bowing his head gave up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews, because it was Preparation Day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for that Sabbath was a great day, requested Pilate to have their legs broken to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But, coming to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they did not break his legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers with his spear pierced his side and immediately there came forth blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He who saw it has borne witness and his witness is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth in order that you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of him shall not be broken."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they have pierced."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate permission to carry away the body of Jesus, and Pilate granted it. So he came and carried his body away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nicodemus, the man who came to him at first by night, came also bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the custom of the Jews in preparing for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was in the place where he had been crucified a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There, on account of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
