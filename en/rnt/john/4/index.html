Jesus, weary from his journey, sat just as he was on the well. It was about noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Samaritan woman said to him, "How do you, a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where do you get the living water from?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it, himself and his sons and his flocks?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered her, "Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst, but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water, flowing out into life eternal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said to him, "Give me this water, so that I may not thirst nor come all the way here to draw."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to her, "Go call your husband and come back here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You say rightly that you have no husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Five husbands you have had, and now the man you have is not your husband. You have told the truth about that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the proper place to worship."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to her, "Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour is coming \'97 yes, is now here \'97 when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeks for such worshipers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When he comes he will tell us all things."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, "I am he, I who am talking to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Upon this came his disciples, and they wondered that he was talking with a woman. But no one said, "What do you want?" or, "Why are you talking with her?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman left her pitcher and went away into the city and said to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Come, see a man who has told me all that I ever did. Is not this the Christ?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They came out of the city and were on the way to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the meantime his disciples begged him, "Rabbi, eat something."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know of."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples said to one another, "Can it be that any one has brought him something to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say that there are still four months and then comes harvest? Why, lift up your eyes, I tell you, and look on the fields, for they are white for harvest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Already the reaper is gaining wages and is gathering a harvest for life eternal, that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Here the saying is true, that 'One is sower and another is reaper.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have sent you to reap what you have not labored for. Others have labored and you have entered into their labor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him on account of the woman's testimony, "He told me all that I ever did."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the Samaritans came out to him, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Many more believed on account of his own words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they said to the woman, "We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard him and we know that this is truly the Savior of the World."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After the two days he went from there into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his native place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed him because they had seen what he did in Jerusalem at the feast. For they, too, had gone to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine. A certain royal officer was there whose son was sick in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>This man heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, and he came to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The officer said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, "Go. Your son is living." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Even while he was going down, his servants met him with the word that his son was living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He inquired of them the hour when he was better. They said to him, "Yesterday at one o'clock the fever left him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father knew that it was at that hour at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son is living," and he believed, himself and his whole household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is the second time that Jesus did a sign just after coming from Judaea to Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
