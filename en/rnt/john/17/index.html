Glorify thy Son that the Son may glorify thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that he may give life eternal to all that thou hast given him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and him whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have glorified thee on the earth by completing the work that thou gavest me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now glorify me, Father, at thy side with the glory that I had at thy side before the existence of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have revealed thy name to the men whom thou didst give me out of the world.
