Martha waited on them, and Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Mary took a pound of pure nard perfume, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who was going to betray him, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Why was not this perfume sold for three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and having the purse used to pilfer what was put into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said, "Let her alone. It was hers to keep for the day of my preparation for the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The poor you always have with you, but me you have not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not on account of Jesus alone, but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The high priests planned to kill Lazarus too,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because many of the Jews on account of him went and believed in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the next day the great crowd which had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, "God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord \'97 the King of Israel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus, finding a young ass, sat on it, as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Fear not, daughter of Zion! Behold, your King comes, sitting on the foal of an ass!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These things his disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The people that were with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead were bearing witness to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For this reason the crowd went to meet him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Pharisees said among themselves, "You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone off after him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew came with Philip and they told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies it bears much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who loves his life destroys it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any one is serving me, let him follow me and where I am there my servant shall be. If any one is serving me, him my Father will honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this I have come to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify thy name!" There came a voice from heaven, "I have glorified it and will again glorify it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The crowd that was standing there and heard said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel spoke to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said, "This voice came, not on my account, but for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world. Now the Ruler of this world will be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This he said indicating by what death he was to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The crowd answered him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them, "A little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, that darkness may not overtake you. He who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so as to become sons of Light." Jesus said these things and then went away and hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, though he had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>so that the word of Isaiah the prophet should be fulfilled. Isaiah said, "Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"He has blinded their eyes and dulled their mind so that they may not see with their eyes nor understand with their mind and repent so that I should heal them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and he spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless, even of the rulers many did believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, in order not to be expelled from the synagogue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jesus cried out, "He who believes in me does not believe in me, but in him who sent me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and he who looks upon me looks upon him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come as a Light into the world that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If any one hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge. The message that I have spoken \'97 that will judge him on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who sent me \'97 the Father himself \'97 has given me a command what I am to say and what I am to speak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and I know that his command is life eternal. So what I am speaking I am speaking just as the Father has told me."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
