Indeed, the hour is coming when every one who kills you will think that he is offering a sacrifice to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>These things they will do because they have not known the Father nor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But these things I have told you in order that when their hour comes you may remember them \'97 that I told you. These things I did not tell you from the beginning because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I am going to him who sent me, and no one of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but, because I have said these things to you, grief has filled your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I should go away. For unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he, when he comes, will convince the world regarding sin and regarding righteousness and regarding judgment \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>regarding sin, because they do not believe in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer see me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>regarding judgment, because the Ruler of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have still many things to tell you; but you cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when he comes \'97 the Spirit of Truth \'97 he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak his own thoughts, but all that he hears he will speak and he will announce to you the things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me because he will take of mine and will announce it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things that the Father has are mine. For that reason I say, 'He will take of mine and announce it to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After a little while you will no longer see me, and again a little while and you will see me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Some of his disciples said to one another, "What is this that he says, 'A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me,' and, 'because I am going to the Father'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So they said, "What is this that he says, 'A little while'? We do not know what he means."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, "Are you discussing with one another about this that I said, 'A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will grieve, but your grief will change into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman when she is bringing forth has grief because her hour has come. But when she has borne the child, she no longer remembers her anguish for the joy that a human being has been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you have grief now, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On that day you will ask me no questions. Truly, truly, I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So far you have asked for nothing in my name; ask and you will obtain, that your joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"I have spoken these things to you in figures. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but will tell you plainly about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On that day you will ask in my name, and I do not tell you that I will make request of the Father for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from the Father's presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again I am leaving the world and am going to the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said, "See, now you are speaking plainly and are using no figures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that you know all things and that you have no need to have any one question you. From this we believe that you have come forth from God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Indeed the hour is coming \'97 it has come \'97 for each one of you to be scattered to his own and leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have spoken these things to you that in me you may have peace. In the world you have distress. But he courageous. I have conquered the world."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
