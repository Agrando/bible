Into this he entered with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Judas who was betraying him knew the place, for Jesus often met with his disciples there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So Judas, getting a battalion of soldiers and some subordinate officers of the high priests and the Pharisees, came there with torches and lamps and weapons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, came forward and said to them, "Whom are you seeking?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They answered him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He said to them, "I am he." Judas the traitor was standing with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When he said to them, "I am he," they moved backward and fell to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Again he questioned them, "Whom are you seeking?" They said, "Jesus the Nazarene."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered, "I have told you that I am he. If then you are seeking for me, let these go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said this that the word might be fulfilled which he had spoken, "Of those whom thou hast given me I have lost none."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword into its sheath. The cup that my Father has given me \'97 shall I not drink it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the battalion and the Tribune and the Jewish policemen arrested Jesus and bound him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and took him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Caiaphas was the man who had advised the Jews that it was best that one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Simon Peter was following Jesus and so was another disciple. That disciple was known to the High Priest and he went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Peter stood by the gate outside. The other disciple, who was known to the High Priest, went out and spoke to the girl at the door and brought in Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The girl at the door said to Peter, "You are not one of this man's disciples, too, are you?" He said, "I am not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The servants and policemen were standing there. They had made a fire, for it was cold, and were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The High Priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered him, "I have spoken frankly to the world. I constantly taught in synagogues and in the Temple courts where all the Jews assemble, and I have spoken nothing in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why do you question me? Question my hearers what I said to them. Certainly they know what I said."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he said this, a policeman, who was standing by, gave Jesus a slap, saying, "Do you answer the High Priest that way?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness against me of the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, "Are not you also one of his disciples?" He denied it and said, "I am not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the servants of the High Priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again Peter denied, and immediately a cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Castle. It was early morning. The Jews did not enter the Castle, wishing to avoid defilement, so that they might eat the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pilate went out to them and said, "What charge do you bring against this man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered, "If he were not an evil-doer, we should not have handed him over to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your law." The Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put any one to death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They said this that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled \'97 the word he had spoken indicating by what death he was to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Pilate entered the Castle again and called Jesus and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered, "Do you say this of yourself or did others tell you about me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your nation and the high priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my subordinates would be fighting to prevent my being delivered up to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate said to him, "Are you not a king then?" Jesus answered, "I am a king, as you say. For this I was born and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth listens to my voice."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find no crime in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you have a custom that I should release for you one at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
