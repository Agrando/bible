If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For neither did his brothers believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come. Any time suits you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it that its ways are wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go on up to the feast yourselves; I am not going up yet to this feast, for my time has not fully come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After saying this to them he stayed in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>After his brothers had gone up to the feast, Jesus himself went up, not openly, but somewhat privately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews were looking for him at the feast and were saying, "Where is that man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A low murmur of debate about him ran through the crowds. Some were saying, "He is good." Others were saying, "No, he misleads the crowd."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nobody, however, was talking openly about him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the Temple courts and began teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews were astonished and said, "How does this man know books when he has never been educated?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answered them, "If any one wills to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God or I am speaking out of my own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>One who speaks out of his own mind is seeking his own glory. He who seeks the glory of him who sent him \'97 he is true, and wickedness is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the Law? Yet no one of you keeps the Law. Why are you trying to kill me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The crowd answered, "You have a demon. Who is trying to kill you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered them, "I did one good work and you all wonder about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses gave you circumcision \'97 not that it is from Moses, but from our fathers \'97 and on the Sabbath you circumcise a person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a person receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the Law of Moses may not be broken, are you bitter against me because I have made a man well on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge by appearances, but judge fair judgment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Some of the Jerusalem people were saying, "Is not this the man they are trying to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>See, he is talking freely and they say nothing to him. It cannot be that the rulers know for truth that this is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we know where this man comes from. The Christ, when he comes \'97 no one will know where he comes from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus, while teaching in the Temple courts, cried out loudly, "You know me and you know where I come from. I have not come of myself, but he is true who sent me. You do not know him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but I know him, for I am from him and he sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They tried to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, for his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>From the crowd many believed in him and said, "The Christ, when he comes, will not do more signs than this man does, will he?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the murmur of debate about him in the crowd, and the high priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus said, "A little while longer I am with you and then I am going to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will look for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews said to one another, "Where is this man going that we shall not find him? Will he go to the Jews who are scattered among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What does this assertion mean, 'You will look for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the last day, the great day, of the feast Jesus stood and cried out, "If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>This he said referring to the Spirit which those who had believed in him were soon to receive. For as yet there was no Spirit, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Some from the crowd, on hearing these words, said, "This man is truly the prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, "This is the Christ." Others said, "The Christ is not coming out of Galilee, is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Does not the Scripture say that the Christ comes of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>A division arose in the crowd over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The officers came to the high priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why did you not bring him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, "Never any man spoke as this man speaks."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees answered them, "Have you also been deluded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Can it be that any one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this crowd who do not know the Law are cursed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus said to them \'97 he who came to Jesus before \'97 being himself one of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"Does our Law condemn any man without first hearing from him and learning what he is doing?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered him, "Can it be that you too are from Galilee? Examine and see that from Galilee no prophet arises."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>[They went each to his home,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
