As she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have carried away my Master and I do not know where they have laid him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After saying this, she turned and saw Jesus standing, but did not recognize that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" She, thinking that he was the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have removed him, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, "Mary!" She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brethren and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, "I have seen the Master," and she told that he had said these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors had been closed where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, "Peace be with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy on seeing the Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father sent me forth so I am sending you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he had said this, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven. If you retain the sins of any, they are retained."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples said to him, "We have seen the Master." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>After eight days the disciples were again within and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood in the midst and said, "Peace be with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to Thomas, "Reach your finger here. Here are my hands. Reach your hand and put it into my side, and become not faithless, but believing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me you have believed.
