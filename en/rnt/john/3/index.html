Can he enter into his mother's womb a second time and be born?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not wonder that I said, 'You must be born from above.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind blows where it will, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes. So is every one who is born of the Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and do you not know these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, we are speaking of what we know, and we are witnessing to what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven \'97 the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that every one who believes in him may have life eternal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that every one who believes in him may not perish, but have life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This is the condemnation, that Light has come into the world and men have loved darkness rather than Light, because their deeds were wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Every one who is doing base things hates the Light and does not come to the Light, that his deeds may not be reproved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he who is doing the truth comes to the Light, that it may be plainly shown that his deeds have been done in union with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After this Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea and there he spent some time with them and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was abundant water there. People were constantly coming and being baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There arose a dispute between the disciples of John and a Jew about purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan to whom you bore testimony \'97 see, he is baptizing and all are coming to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered, "A man can assume nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves are witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must increase, but I must decrease."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth is of the earth and he speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What he has seen and heard, that he testifies to, yet no one accepts his testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He who accepts his testimony has set his seal that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He whom God has sent speaks the word of God, for he does not give him the Spirit by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who believes in the Son has life eternal. He who disbelieves in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
