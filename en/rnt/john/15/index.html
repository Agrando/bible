As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the Vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me and I in him \'97 he bears much fruit; but without me you cannot do anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If any one does not abide in me, he is cast out like a branch and withers, and they gather them and throw them into the fire and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will and it will be done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By this is my Father glorified \'97 by your bearing much fruit and becoming my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep my commands, you will abide in my love as I have kept my Father's commands and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my command \'97 to love one another as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love has no one than this: to lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are my friends if you do what I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I no longer call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I call you friends, for all that I have heard from the Father I have made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It was not you who chose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I am commanding you that you may love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you were of the world the world would love its own. But you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world. For this reason the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said to you, 'The servant is not superior to his Master.' If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all these things they will do to you because of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who hates me hates my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them works which no other did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and have hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But in order that the saying written in their Law may be fulfilled, 'They hated me without a cause.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father \'97 the Spirit of Truth who goes forth from the Father \'97 he will witness concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you are witnesses because you have been with me from the beginning."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
