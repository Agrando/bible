Night is coming when no one can work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While I am in the world I am the light of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After saying this, he spit on the ground and made clay with the spittle and put the clay on the man's eyes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam." He went away and washed and came back seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>His neighbors and those accustomed to see him before, when he was begging, said, "Is not this the man that sat and begged?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, "This is he." Others said, "No, but he is like him." He said, "I am the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said to him, "How then were your eyes opened?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He replied, "The man called Jesus made clay and spread it on my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' I went and washed and received my sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They said to him, "Where is that man?" He said, "I do not know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought him to the Pharisees \'97 the man once blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It was on the Sabbath day that Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Pharisees in their turn asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put clay on my eyes and I washed and I saw."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man, if he is a sinner, do such signs?" So there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They said again to the blind man, "What do you say about him, now that he has opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews did not believe the story that he was blind and recovered his sight, until they had called the parents of the man who had recovered his sight</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and had asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how can he see now?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But how he sees now we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed Jesus as the Christ, he should be cast out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For this reason his parents said, "He is of age, ask him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They called a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The man answered, "Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I know, I was blind and now I see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, "I have told you already and you did not listen, why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They flouted him and said, "You are that man's disciple; we are Moses' disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spoke to Moses, but this man \'97 we do not know where he comes from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered them, "There is something wonderful in this. You do not know where he comes from, yet he has opened my eyes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God does not listen to a sinner, but if any one is God-fearing and does his will, God hears him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Since the world began it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he could not do anything."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered him, "You were born in sin \'97 wholly; and are you teaching us?" and they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and found him and said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The man answered, "Who is he, Sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, "You have seen him, and it is he who is talking with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said, "I believe, Sir," and bowed down before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and said to him, "Are we blind also?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains with you."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
