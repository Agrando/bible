If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles because the light is not in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said this, and then he said to them, "Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The disciples said to him, "Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jesus had spoken of his death. They thought that he was speaking of the repose of sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus said to them frankly, "Lazarus has died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I am glad on your account that I was not there \'97 so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thomas, who is called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples, "Let us go too to die with him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus came he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them regarding their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him. Mary was sitting in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Martha said to Jesus, "Master, if you had been here my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise at the resurrection on the last day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. He who believes in me even though he dies will live,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and no one who lives and believes in me will ever die. Do you believe this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said to him, "Yes, Master. I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Having said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying to her privately, "The Teacher is here and is asking for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>She, when she heard it, rose quickly and went to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews who were with Mary in the house trying to comfort her, seeing her rise quickly and go out, followed thinking that she was going to the tomb to wail there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, "Master, if you had been here my brother would not have died."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her weeping, he was indignant in spirit and disturbed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Master, come and see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Jews said, "See, how he loved him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have prevented this man from dying?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus, again indignant, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying on the entrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Master, he is already offensive, for he has been dead four days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank thee for hearing me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I know that thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd that stand around I say it, that they may believe that thou didst send me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After saying this he called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Forth came the dead man, swathed feet and hands in grave-clothes and his face bound up in a handkerchief. Jesus said, "Loose him and let him go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, "What are we doing? for this man is doing many signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him alone in this way, all will believe in him and the Romans will come and destroy our place and nation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>One of them, Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year, said to them, "You do not know anything</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>nor do you reason that it is better for you that one man should die for the people and so the whole nation escape destruction."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He did not say this of himself, but being High Priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God now scattered far and wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>From that day they plotted to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So Jesus no more walked about openly among the Jews, but went away from there into the country near the wild lands, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The Passover of the Jews was near and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They were looking for Jesus and were saying to one another, as they stood in the Temple courts, "What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that, if any one knew where he was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
