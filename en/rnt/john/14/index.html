Believe in God and believe in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In my Father's house are many abiding places. If it were not so I would have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I am going to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And to where I am going you know the way."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas said to him, "Master, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to him, "I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you had known me you would have known my Father also. But now you know him and have seen him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip said to him, "Master, show us the Father and we shall be satisfied."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said, "Have I been so much time with you and you have not known me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I speak not of myself. The Father abides in me and does his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me. But if not, believe on account of the works themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes in me \'97 the works that I am doing he also will do and greater works than these he will do, because I am going to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whatever you ask in my name that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"If you love me, you will keep my commands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and I will ask the Father and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot accept because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him because he abides with you and will be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I am living you too will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who has my commands and keeps them \'97 he is the one that loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will show myself to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas  said to him, "Master, what has happened that you are going to show yourself to us and not to the world?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him, "If any one loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him and we will come to him and abide with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who loves me not does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine, but is the word of the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"These things I have spoken to you while yet with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The Counselor \'97 the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name \'97 will teach you all things and remind you of all that I have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor fearful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You heard that I said to you I am going away and am coming back to you. If you loved me you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now I have told you before it comes to pass, that when it does come to pass you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I shall no longer speak much with you, for the Ruler of this world is coming and he has no part in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But that the world may know that I love the Father, even as the Father commanded me, so I am doing. Rise, let us go hence."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
