What do you say?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This they said, testing him, to have something to accuse him of. But Jesus stooped over and wrote with his finger on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As they kept on questioning him, he lifted himself up and said to them, "Let the sinless one among you be the first to throw a stone at her,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and again he stooped over and went on writing on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After hearing that, they passed out one by one, beginning with the older men, and he was left alone and the woman there in the center.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus raised himself up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one sentenced you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said, "No one, Sir." Jesus said, "Neither do I sentence you. Go. From now on sin no more."]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees said to him, "You are bearing witness to yourself; your witness is not true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered them, "Even if I witness to myself, my witness is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going. You do not know where I came from or where I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge according to the flesh, I judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even if I judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but when I judge he who sent me is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In our law it is written that the evidence of two persons is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am giving witness to myself and the Father who sent me witnesses to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said to him, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words he spoke in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple courts, and no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said again to them, "I am going away and you will search for me and will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Jews said, "Will he kill himself, and so says, 'Where I am going you cannot come'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins. Unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said to him, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "Exactly what I have been telling you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say about you and to judge. But he who sent me is true, and what I have heard from him I speak in the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They did not perceive that he was speaking to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that of myself I do nothing, but as the Father taught me, so I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While he was speaking these things, many believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus said to the Jews that had believed him, "If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, "We are descendants of Abraham and have never been in slavery to any man. How do you say, 'You will become free'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, every one who practices sin is the slave of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The slave does not stay in the house forever; the Son stays forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So if the Son frees you, you will be really free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you are descendants of Abraham; but you are trying to kill me, because my word has no place within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I am speaking what I have seen with my Father and you are doing what you have heard with your father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered him, "Abraham is our father." He said to them, "If you were children of Abraham you would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth which I have heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You do the works of your father." They said to him, "We were not born of unchastity. We have one father \'97 God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, "If God were your father you would love me; for I came forth from God and am now here. For I have not come of myself, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to practice. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not stand in the truth; for truth is not in him. When he speaks falsehood, he speaks out of his own; for he is a liar and the father of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But me \'97 because I tell you the truth \'97 me you do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who of you convinces me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He who is of God listens to God's words. For this reason you do not listen \'97 because you are not of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews answered him, "Do we not say correctly that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, "I have not a demon, but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>I am not seeking my own glory. There is one who seeks it and judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Truly, truly, I tell you, if any one keeps my word he will not look on death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died and the prophets died, and you say, 'If any one keeps my word he will never taste of death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Are you greater than our father Abraham? And yet he died and the prophets died. Whom do you make yourself out to be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Yet you do not know him, but I know him, and if I should say that I did not know him I should be a liar like you. But I know him and I keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Abraham your father rejoiced that he was to see my day, and he saw it and was glad."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Jews said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, before Abraham came into being I am."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus concealed himself and left the Temple courts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
