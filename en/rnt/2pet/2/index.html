But their condemnation from of old has not been inactive, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if God did not spare angels that had sinned, but thrust them down to Tartarus and committed them to pits of darkness to be kept for judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and did not spare the ancient world, but guarded Noah, a herald of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought the flood on the world of the ungodly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and if reducing to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah he condemned them to destruction, making them an example for the godless of what would come upon them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and rescued righteous Lot worn out by the indecent lives of the lawless, \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for that righteous man living among them was tortured day and night in his righteous soul by the sight and hearing of their lawless deeds, \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>the Lord knows how to rescue the pious from trial and how to keep the wicked under punishment for the day of judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>especially those who go after flesh in polluting passions, and despise lordship.

They think it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blots as they revel in their deceptions while they feast sumptuously with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have eyes engrossed with some adulteress, eyes which never cease from sin. They seduce unsteady souls. They have hearts practiced in covetousness.
