For while doing these things you will never stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For so entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this reason I shall always keep reminding you of these things, although you know them and are steadfast in the truth that you have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I think it right so long as I am in this tent to arouse you by reminding you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>since I know that the laying aside of my tent will come soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made plain to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will endeavor also on every occasion to make it so that after my going you shall have these things in memory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For we were not following cunningly devised myths when we told you of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he received from God the Father honor and glory when such words as these were borne to him from the majestic glory, "This is my Son, the Beloved; in him I delight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this voice we heard borne from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus have we the words of the prophets confirmed, and you will do well to give attention to them as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>since you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from any one's private interpretation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for prophecy never came by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
