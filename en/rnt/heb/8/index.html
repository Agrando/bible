Whence it is necessary for this one to have something to offer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If he were upon the earth he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They minister as an example and shadow of the things in heaven, just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the Tent. "See," it was said, "that you make everything according to the model shown you on the mountain."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now Christ has obtained a ministry as much more excellent as the covenant of which he is mediator is better and based upon better promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if that first covenant had been faultless a place would not have been sought for a second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But finding fault with it he says, "The days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>not in the manner of the covenant which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not abide by my covenant and I ceased to care for them, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They shall not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother saying, 'Know the Lord'; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I will be merciful to their wrong-doings and their sins I will remember no more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In saying "new" he has pronounced the first covenant old. But what grows old and decadent is near to disappearance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
