God is laying it upon you as upon sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if you are without discipline, in which all share, then you are bastards and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Besides, we had fathers of our flesh who disciplined us and we used to reverence them. Shall we not much more be submissive to the Father of our spirits and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they for a few days disciplined us as seemed good to them, but he for our profit, that we may share his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All discipline for the time being seems not joyous but grievous, but afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have passed through its training.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So raise the relaxed hands and straighten the unstrung knees</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint but rather cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow after peace with all men and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Be on your guard that no one shall fail of the grace of God, that no bitter root shall sprout up and trouble you and through it many be stained,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that there shall be none unchaste, or profane like Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know that afterward when he wished to inherit the blessing he was rejected, for he found no place for a change in his father's mind though he sought it earnestly with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you have not come to something that may be touched, ablaze with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which those who heard begged not to have spoken of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they could not bear the command, "If even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so dreadful was the sight that Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, to tens of thousands of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the festal assembly and congregation of first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant and to the sprinkled blood which tells something better than the blood of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Beware of rejecting him who is speaking. For if those did not escape who rejected him who taught the divine will on earth, much less shall we if we reject him who speaks from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>His voice then shook the earth, but now he has announced, "Yet once for all I shall shake not only the earth but also heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this expression "yet once for all" shows the removal of the things shaken, as of things that have been made, that the unshaken things may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So then, since we are receiving an unshaken kingdom, let us have grace by which we may worship God acceptably with reverence and awe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
