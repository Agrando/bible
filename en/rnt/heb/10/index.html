Because the worshipers, once for all cleansed, would have had no consciousness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But in the sacrifices these are called to mind every year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore on coming into the world he says, "Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire: a body thou hast prepared for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not delight in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, 'Here I have come \'97 in the roll of the book it is written of me \'97 to do thy will, O God.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He first says, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not desire nor delight in," such as are offered according to the Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and then he says, "Here I have come to do thy will." He takes away the first to establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By this "will" we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Every priest stands daily doing service and offering many times the same sacrifices, although they never can take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But this Priest after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, took his seat at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for the future only waiting until his enemies are made his footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering he has forever perfected those who are made holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Holy Spirit testifies this to us; for after having said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts and on their minds I will write them," he adds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"and their sins and their law-breakings I will remember no more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Since we have, then, brethren, confidence in entering the holy place through the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by the new and living way which he has made for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and since we have a great Priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us come with true hearts in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies bathed in pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful who has promised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and let us keep watch to incite one another to love and noble deeds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not neglecting to assemble yourselves, as some do, but encouraging one another, and so much the more, as you see the day drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there remains no longer any sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a dreadful expectation of doom and a fury of fire that will devour the opposers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Any one who sets aside a law of Moses dies without pity on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Of how much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy who has trampled on the Son of God, who has thought the blood of the covenant, by which it was made holy, an unholy thing, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge his people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is dreadful to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember the early days in which, after being enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>at one time made a public spectacle by reproaches and distresses, at another time making common cause with those who were thus treated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For you even suffered with the prisoners and accepted the plundering of your property with joy, knowing that you had a better and enduring possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do not, then, cast away your confidence, for it will have a great reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You have need of patience so that after doing the will of God you may gain the promised blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yet "a little, very little, while, and he who is coming will come and will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>My righteous man will live by faith; but if he shrinks back, my soul has no delight in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of those who shrink back and perish, but of those who have faith and will win their souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
