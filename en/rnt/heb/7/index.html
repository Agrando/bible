This latter he did once for all when he offered himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Law makes high priests of men who have infirmities, but the word of the oath, which comes after the Law, makes High Priest of a Son who is perfected forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
