Be content with what you have. For he has said, "I will not fail you nor will I forsake you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So we may say with courage, "The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember your leaders, those who have spoken to you God's message, think how they ended their lives and imitate their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ is yesterday and to-day the same \'97 yes, and through the ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not be carried away with all sorts of foreign teachings. It is well to have the heart strengthened by grace, not by special kinds of food. Those who live in that way are not profited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have an altar of which those who worship in the Tent have no right to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the bodies of the animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the High Priest are burned outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this reason Jesus also, to make the people holy by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us go out to him outside the camp and bear the reproaches cast on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have here no continuing city, but we are seeking the coming one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Through him then let us offer to God always the sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that make confession in his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not forget kindness and generosity, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Obey your leaders and yield to their authority; for they watch over your souls as those who must give account, that they may do it with joy and not with sighing. That would be unprofitable for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us: for we are confident that we have a good conscience, wishing to live nobly in every way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I earnestly beg you to do this that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>May the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of an eternal covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>equip you with every good thing for doing his will, doing in you what is well-pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I beg you, brethren, to bear with my words of exhortation; for I have written to you briefly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I wish you to know that our brother Timothy has been set at liberty. With him, if he comes soon, I will see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Give my greetings to all your leaders and all the holy. Those who are from Italy send their greetings to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Grace be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
