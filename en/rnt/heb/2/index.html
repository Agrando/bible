Or the son of man that thou carest for him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels. With glory and honor thou hast crowned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All things thou hast put under his feet." When he put all things under him he left nothing that was not put under him. We do not yet see all things put under him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death that by the grace of God he might taste of death for every man, now crowned with glory and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was fitting that he through whom are all things and for whom are all things, when leading many sons to glory, should make the great Leader of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who makes holy and they who are made holy are all of one. For this cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, "I will tell thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to thee,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and again, "I will trust in him," and again, "Here am I and the children whom God has given me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since then the children share in blood and flesh, he himself in the same way shared in them, in order that through death he might defeat him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and set free all those who through fear of death were all their lives doomed to slavery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he does not come to the help of angels, but he comes to the help of the descendants of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And for that reason he had to be made like his brethren in everything, so as to be a compassionate and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For since he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
