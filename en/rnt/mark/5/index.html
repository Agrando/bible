I adjure you by God, not to torment me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For Jesus had said to him, "Come out from the man, you impure spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "Legion is my name, for we are many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he begged Jesus earnestly not to send them out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There was on the mountain-side a great herd of swine feeding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the demons begged him, "Send us to the swine and let us go into them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He consented. The impure spirits came out of the man and entered into the swine. Then the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned in the lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At this, those who were feeding them fled and told it in the city and in the fields, and people came to see what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they came to Jesus, they saw the demoniac, the man who had had the legion, sitting there clothed and in his right mind. They were struck with awe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Those who had seen it told them about what had happened to the demoniac and about the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they began to beg him to go away from their neighborhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As Jesus was entering the boat, the man who had been demoniac begged him to let him stay with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He, however, did not consent, but said, "Go to your own house and to your family, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So he went away and began to make known in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side of the lake, a great crowd gathered around him as he stood on the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came one of the directors of the synagogue, by the name of Jairus, and as soon as he saw Jesus he fell at his feet</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and pleaded with him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is near to death. I beg you to come and lay your hands on her so that she may be saved and live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus went away with him and a great crowd followed and pressed upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There was a woman who had for twelve years had a hemorrhage</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and had suffered much under the treatment of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, though without becoming better, but rather worse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>this woman had heard about Jesus, and she came in the crowd behind him and touched his cloak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for she said, "If I can touch even his clothes, I shall be healed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Immediately the hemorrhage ceased and she knew in her body that she was healed of her affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus was at once conscious that power had gone from him, and turned in the crowd and said, "Who touched my clothes?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>His disciples replied, "You see the people crowding you, and do you ask, 'Who touched me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he looked around to see who had done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the woman, afraid and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell before him and told him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well of your trouble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While he was still speaking, people came from the house of the synagogue Director and told him, "Your daughter is dead; why annoy the teacher any longer?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the Director, "Never fear; only believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He did not permit any one to accompany him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When they approached the Director's house, they saw a noisy crowd weeping loudly and wailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He entered and said, "Why are you making so much noise and weeping so? The child is not dead, but is sleeping."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But they laughed at him. Then he put them all out and took the child's father and mother and his own companions and went in where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Taking hold of the child's hand he said to her, "Talitha koum," which means, "Little girl, rise up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Immediately the little girl rose up and walked around. She was twelve years old. They were utterly amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But he strictly ordered that no one should know it, and told them to give her something to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
