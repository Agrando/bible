But they kept silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He looked round on them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched the hand out and it was completely restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Pharisees went out immediately and joined with the Herodians in a plot to put him out of the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake and a great number from Galilee followed him. Also from Judaea</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and from beyond the Jordan and from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus spoke to his disciples to have a little boat ready for his use on account of the throng, to prevent them from pressing upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he healed many, so that all that had diseases crowded around him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The impure spirits, also, when they saw him, fell down before him and shouted, "You are the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he ordered them repeatedly and sternly not to make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus went up on the mountain and invited whom he chose, and they came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He appointed twelve who should be with him and whom he could send out to preach</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He appointed these twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Jesus came into a house</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the crowd gathered again so that they were not able even to eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When his family heard of it, they went out to take him by force, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, "He has Beelzebul in him, and by the Chief of the demons he casts out demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus called them to him and said to them in figures: "How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a house divides against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No one can enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he can plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly I tell you all sins will be forgiven to the sons of men and all their profane words, whatever they may say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but whoever speaks profane words against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an eternal sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This he said because they said, "He has an impure spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then came his mother and his brothers, and standing outside sent and called him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A crowd was sitting around him when some one said to him, "Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside and want you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he answered, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Looking round at those sitting in the circle about him he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
