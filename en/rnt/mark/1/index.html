There he was among the wild beasts, but angels waited upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After John had been betrayed, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, "The time has been completed and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As he passed along by the lake of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They immediately left their nets and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat, mending their net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They came into Capernaum. Immediately on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The people were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as if he had authority, and not as the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>There was in their synagogue a man wider the power of an impure spirit, and he immediately cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"What have you to do with us, Nazarene Jesus? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are \'97 the Holy one of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus reproved him and said, "Be still, and come out of him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the impure spirit convulsed him, and screamed loudly and came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were all amazed so that they discussed together, "What is this? A new powerful teaching! He commands even the impure spirits and they obey him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So reports about him immediately spread everywhere through the whole region of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mother-in-law of Simon was lying sick with fever. Immediately they told him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He came to her, and took her by the hand and lifted her up. The fever left her and she waited on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When evening came and the sun had set, they brought to him all the sick and those who were afflicted with demons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the whole city was gathered before the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons, not allowing the demons to talk, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Early in the morning, while it was still night, he rose and went out, and went away into a solitary place and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon and his companions searched for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and when they found him they said to him, "All are looking for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he said to them, "Let us go somewhere else among the neighboring villages, so that I may preach there too; for it was for this purpose that I came away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went through all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There came to him a leper, begging him and kneeling to him and saying, "If you will, you can cleanse me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He had compassion on him, and stretched out his hand and touched him, and said, "I do will it; be cleansed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Immediately the leprosy left him and he became clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Jesus sent him away after strictly charging him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Be sure, do not say anything to anybody, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed for evidence."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the man went away and began to proclaim freely and to spread the report, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter openly into any city, but stayed out in the wild country, and people came to him from every direction.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
