There will not be left one stone upon another which will not be thrown down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then, when he was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the Temple buildings, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Tell us when these things will be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to come to pass?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus began and said to them: "See to it that no one misleads you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and they will deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. These things must come, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places and there will be famines. These things are the beginning of birth-pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you, be on your guard. They will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will have to stand before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The good news must first be preached to all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they are taking you along to deliver you up, feel no anxiety what you are to say, but say whatever is given to you in that hour. For it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Brother will betray brother to death and father will betray child, and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You will be hated by all men for my name, but he who endures to the end, he will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought notLet the reader consider, then let those in Judea flee to the mountains,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and let him who is on top of the house not descend and enter to take anything from his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and let him who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Alas for the women with child and the nursing mothers in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray that it may not be in the winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For those will be days of misery such as has not been since the beginning of God's creation until now, and never will be again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Unless the Lord had shortened those days, no human being would be saved.
