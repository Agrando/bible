The high priests and the scribes were contriving how they might seize him by some stratagem and kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For they said, "Not at the feast; there might be a popular outbreak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>During his stay in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper, while he was reclining at table there came a woman with an alabaster jar of pure nard perfume, very costly. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Some were indignant among themselves and said, "For what purpose was this waste of the perfume?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor." So they were indignant at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said, "Let her alone. Why are you annoying her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The poor you have always with you, and whenever you will you can do them good, but me you have not always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has done what she could. She has anticipated the anointing of my body for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I tell you truly wherever the good news shall be proclaimed over the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the high priests to betray him to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money. He meanwhile was contriving how he could betray him at some favorable time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the first day of unleavened bread \'97 when they sacrificed the Passover lamb \'97 his disciples said to him, "Where do you wish us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and wherever he goes in, say to the householder, 'The Teacher says, Where is the guest room for me where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. There prepare for us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The disciples went and entered the city and found everything as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the evening Jesus came with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As they were reclining and eating, he said, "I tell you truly one of you will betray me, one who is now eating with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They began to be sad and to say one to another, "It cannot be I?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said, "It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping with me into the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Son of Man is going just as it has been written concerning him, but alas for that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! Well were it for that man if he had not been born!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they were eating, he took a loaf and blessed it and broke it and gave to them, saying, "Take it; this is my body."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant which is shed for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I tell you truly I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>After singing a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus said to them, "You will all fail, because it has been written, 'I will smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered abroad.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after I am raised up I will precede you into Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Peter said to him, "Though all should fail, yet I will not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said to him, "I tell you truly that to-day, this very night, before the cock crows, you will three times disown me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he kept saying more earnestly, "Though I have to die with you, I will not disown you." Just so they all said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He took Peter and James and John with him and began to be in terror and distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said to them, "My soul is in anguish, to the point of death. Stay here and watch."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he went forward a little and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee. Take away this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Watch and pray that you may not fall into temptation. The spirit is eager, but the flesh is weak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he went away again and prayed, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Again he returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He came back the third time and said to them, "Are you sleeping on? Are you resting? That is enough. The hour has come. Now the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of the sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Rise, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Immediately, even while he was speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, was there and with him a crowd with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the high priests and the scribes and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The traitor had given them a sign, "The man I kiss, that is he. Seize him and take him safely away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when he came, he immediately advanced to Jesus and said, "Rabbi," and kissed him affectionately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They laid their hands on him and held him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to them, "Have you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as you would a robber?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Every day I was with you in the Temple courts teaching and you did not lay hands on me. But this is so that the Scriptures may be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then all his friends left him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>There was a young man following him who had thrown a linen cloth around his naked body. They seized him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>but he left the linen cloth and fled naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They led Jesus away to the High Priest, and all the high priests and elders and scribes assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Peter followed him at a distance and came inside the court of the High Priest and sat with the attendants, and warmed himself in the light of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The high priests and all the council tried to get testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, but they could not find any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then some rose and testified falsely against him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this Temple made by hands and in three days I will build another not made by hands.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>But their testimony did not agree even regarding this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Then the High Priest rose and came forward into the midst and questioned Jesus, "Have you no answer? What about this evidence against you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he was silent and did not answer a word. Again the High Priest questioned him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus said, "I am, and you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the High Priest rent his garments and said, "Why do we any longer have need of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You have heard his impious words. How does it appear to you?" They all condemned him as deserving of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then some began to spit on him and to blindfold him and to strike him with their fists and say, "Prophesy," and the attendants slapped him as they took him in charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the High Priest came,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>and when she saw Peter warming himself she looked at him and said, "You too were with the Nazarene, this Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied it and said, "I do not know nor understand what you are saying." Then he went out into the outer courtyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>There the maid saw him and began again to say to those who stood around, "This man is one of them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he again denied. Again after a little the men who were standing by said to Peter, "Truly you are one of them, for you are a Galilaean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>But he began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are speaking of."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Immediately, for the second time, the cock crew and Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows twice you will disown me three times," and when he thought of it he wept aloud.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
