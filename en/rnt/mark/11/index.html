Untie him and bring him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anybody asks, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Master has need of him,' and at once he will send him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They went and found the colt tied near the door outside in the street, and they untied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Some of those who were standing there said to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They gave the reply that Jesus had told them to give, and the men let them take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They brought the colt to Jesus and threw upon it their cloaks and he mounted it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then many spread their cloaks in the road and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some went in front and some followed, shouting, "God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! God in highest heaven save him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He entered Jerusalem and came into the Temple courts. After inspecting everything, because it was already late he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the next morning, after they had left Bethany, he was hungry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and seeing a fig tree at a distance in full leaf he went to it on the chance of finding something on it. But when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he said to it, "Nevermore may any one eat fruit from you!" And his disciples heard him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They came to Jerusalem, and he went into the Temple courts and began to cast out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of the dove-sellers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and would not allow any one to carry anything through the Temple courts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for he taught and said to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When the high priests and the scribes heard of this they tried to contrive to put him out of the way, for they were afraid of him because the people were deeply impressed by his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When evening came, Jesus and his disciples used to go out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As they were passing by early in the morning they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter, calling to mind, said to him, "Rabbi, see, the fig tree that you cursed has withered up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered, "Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I tell you truly whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his mind, but believes that what he says will be, will have it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this reason I say to you, all things whatever that you pray and ask for, believe that you have obtained them and you will have them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when you stand praying, forgive if you have anything against any one, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your failings."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking about in the Temple courts, the high priests and the scribes came to him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and said, "By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you authority to do them?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question; answer me and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The baptism of John \'97 was it from heaven or of men? Answer me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they discussed among themselves, "If we say 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we say, 'From men,' \'97 they feared the people, for all regarded John as really a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And he replied, "Neither will I tell you by what power I am doing these things."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
