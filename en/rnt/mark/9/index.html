They were all alone. There in their presence he became transfigured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His clothes became dazzlingly white, with a whiteness that no bleacher on earth can impart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them and conversed with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is fine for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he did not know what to say, they were so frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then a cloud overshadowed them and there came a voice out of the cloud, "This is my beloved son, hear him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then suddenly as they looked around they no longer saw any one, but Jesus only, with themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they were descending the mountain, he told them not to tell any one what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This command they kept, but debated among themselves what the rising from the dead was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He said, "Elijah does come first and reforms everything. How is it written also of the Son of Man that he suffers many things and is treated with contempt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I tell you Elijah has already come, and they have done to him what they chose, just as it was written of him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When they came to his disciples, they saw a great crowd around them and scribes debating with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At once the whole crowd saw him and were amazed, and they ran to him and welcomed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He asked them, "What are you debating?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One of the crowd answered, "Teacher, I have brought my son to you. He has a dumb spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and whenever it attacks him it convulses him and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth. He is wasting away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they had not the power."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered, "O faithless generation! how long must I be with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring him to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They brought him to him. As soon as the spirit saw Jesus, he convulsed the boy so that he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus asked the father, "How long is it since this came on him?" He said, "From early childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Often it has thrown him into the fire or into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said, " 'If you can'! All things are possible for one who believes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>At once the father of the child cried out, "I believe; help my unbelief."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus saw that the crowd was rapidly increasing, so he rebuked the impure spirit with the words, "Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you to come out and never to enter him again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He screamed and convulsed the boy and came out. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said, "He is dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him and he stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said, "This kind cannot come out by any means except by prayer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>After leaving there, they were passing through Galilee, and he did not wish any one to know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he was teaching his disciples and telling them that the Son of Man would be betrayed into the hands of men and that they would kill him, and that three days after being killed he would rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they did not understand what he said and were afraid to question him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They came to Capernaum. After entering the house, Jesus asked them, "What were you discussing on the road?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They were silent, for on the road they had disputed among themselves which was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Taking a seat he called the twelve, and said, "If any one wishes to be first, he must be the last of all and the servant of all."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he took a little child and placed him in the midst of them, and, putting his arms around him, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Whoever receives one of such little children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me receives not me, but him who sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John said to him, "Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name \'97 a man who does not follow us \'97 and we told him not to do it, because he does not follow us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, "Do not tell him not to do it. For no one who does a miracle in my name can quickly speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For whoever is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, I tell you truly that he will not miss his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever causes the fall of one of these little ones that believe, it would be better for him if, with a great millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>If your hand is a snare to you, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go away into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If your foot is a snare to you, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame than with two feet to be cast into Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If your eye is a snare to you, tear it out. It is better to enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed than with two eyes to be cast into Gehenna,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For every one will be salted with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good, but if the salt loses its saltness, with what can you flavor it? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
