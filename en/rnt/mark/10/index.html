Again the people crowded to him, and again as usual he was teaching them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Some Pharisees came up and asked him, "Is it right for a man to divorce his wife?" They meant to catch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He answered, "What did Moses command you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said, "Moses permitted a husband to give a certificate of divorce and send his wife away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus said to them, "Because of your hard-heartedness he wrote this law for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But from the beginning of the creation, 'male and female made he them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they were in the house, his disciples asked him again about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a wife divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They were bringing little children to him to have him touch them, but his disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I tell you truly whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will not enter it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he took them into his arms and blessed them, putting his hands on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was going out into the road, a man came running and knelt before him and asked, "Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit life eternal?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor thy father and thy mother.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He answered, "Teacher, all these I have kept from my boyhood."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus looking at him loved him and said to him, "One thing you lack. Go sell all that you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his face darkened at that reply, and he went away grieved, for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus, looking around on his disciples, said, "With what difficulty will those who have wealth enter the kingdom of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciples were astonished at his words. Jesus spoke again and said, "Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They were amazed beyond measure and said to one another, "Then who can be saved?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus looked at them and said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter began, "Well, we have left everything and have followed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said, "I tell you truly there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the sake of the good news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will not receive a hundred fold more now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many who are first will be last and the last first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They were on the road going up to Jerusalem and Jesus was walking in advance. Astonishment fell on them, and those who were following were fearful. Then again he took aside the twelve and began and told them what was going to happen to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the high priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they will make sport of him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him. But after three days he will rise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>James and John the sons of Zebedee came to him and said, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said, "What do you want me to do for you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said, "Grant that one of us may sit on your right hand and the other on your left hand in your glory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They said to him, "We can." Jesus said, "The cup that I drink you will drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but to sit on my right or my left is not mine to give, but it will be for those for whom it has been prepared."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When the ten heard about this, they became indignant at James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that those who are thought to rule the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is not so among you. But whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever of you wishes to be first shall be the slave of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They came to Jericho. As Jesus was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus , a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, "Son of David, Jesus, pity me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." They called the blind man, saying, "Courage; rise up; he is calling you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He, throwing aside his cloak, sprang up and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said, "Rabboni, I want to regain my sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus said, "Go. Your faith has healed you." At once he could see and followed Jesus along the road.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
