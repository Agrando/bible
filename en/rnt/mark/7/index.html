There are also many other traditions which they have been taught to hold tenaciously, such as washing cups and pitchers and copper vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why do not your disciples live according to the tradition of our fore-fathers? Why do they eat their bread with common hands?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He replied, "Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites when he wrote: 'This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>in vain they worship me, while they teach what are merely commandments of men.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neglecting the commands of God, you hold firmly to the traditions of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said further to them, "How thoroughly you set aside the command of God so that you may keep your tradition!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, 'Honor thy father and thy mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say, 'If a man says to his father or his mother, Whatever benefit you enjoy from me is now Korban, that is, a gift to God,' \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>thus nullifying the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and many similar things you do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then, calling the crowd to him again, he said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing from outside a man that can go into him and defile him, but the things that come out of the man are the things that defile the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked about his figurative language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, "Are you too so lacking in insight? Do you not know that everything from outside that goes into a man is unable to defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach and passes out into the sewer?" Thus he pronounced all foods clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"But," he said, "what comes out of a man is what defiles him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for from within, out of the hearts of men, come evil thoughts, unchastities, thefts, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>adulteries, lusts, wickednesses, deceit, sensuality, an evil eye, slander, arrogance, recklessness \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all these had things come out from within, and they defile the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Leaving that place, Jesus went into the borders of Tyre. He entered a house and did not wish any one to know it, but he could not escape notice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At once a woman whose daughter was afflicted by an impure spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he said, "Let the children be well fed first. For it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>She answered, "Yes, Sir, even the dogs under the table eat from the children's crumbs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said to her, "For this answer, go. The demon has gone out of your daughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>She returned to her house and found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Again leaving the region of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the lake of Galilee into the midst of the region of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They brought to him a deaf man who stammered, and begged him to lay his hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He took him aside from the crowd, put his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue with spit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said, "Ephphatha" that is, Be opened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and his ears were opened, and immediately his tongue was freed and he talked plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell any one. But the more he forbade them the more widely they spread it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for they were astonished beyond all bounds and said, "He has done everything well. He makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
