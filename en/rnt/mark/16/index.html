The sun had risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when they looked they saw that the stone had been rolled away. It was very large.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side dressed in a white robe, and they were frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he said to them, "Do not be frightened. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has risen. He is not here. This is the place where they laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go tell his disciples and Peter, He has gone before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he told you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The women came out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and amazement seized them. They told nothing to any one, they were so frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After Jesus rose early on the morning of the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told those who had been with him as they were grieving and lamenting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They went and told the rest. But neither did they believe these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Later he appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at table, and reproached them for their lack of faith and dullness of mind because they had not believed those who had seen him since his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all the creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These signs will follow those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak strange languages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly it will not harm them. They will lay hands on sick people and the sick will be well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the Lord Jesus, after talking with them, was taken up into heaven and sat down on the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming their message by the signs which accompanied it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
