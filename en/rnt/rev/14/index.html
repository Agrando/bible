The sound that I heard was as of harpers playing on their harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been ransomed from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were ransomed from among men as first-fruits for God and the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>No lie was found in their mouths. They are stainless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven having eternal good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said in a loud voice, "Reverence God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Another angel, a second, followed, saying, "Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of her passion for unchastity."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice, "If any one worships the Beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead and on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he also will drink of the wine of God's passion which has been mixed undiluted in the cup of his wrath, and he will be tortured in fire and brimstone in the presence of holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torture will ascend for ages of ages and they will have no rest day or night \'97 those who worship the Beast and his image, and any one who receives the mark of his name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the endurance of the holy who keep the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth." "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their toils. For their works follow with them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I looked and there was a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man. He had on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted with a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, "Thrust in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is dry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then another angel came out from the Temple that is in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are fully ripe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth and flung it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The winepress was trodden outside the city and blood came out from the wine-press as high as the horses' bridles for a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
