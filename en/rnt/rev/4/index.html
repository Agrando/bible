A throne was standing in heaven and on the throne One was sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He who was sitting there was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius. A rainbow, in appearance like an emerald, encircled the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Around the throne I saw twenty-four thrones and on these thrones twenty-four elders seated, clothed in white garments and with golden crowns on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>From the throne issued lightnings and voices and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. These are the seven Spirits of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea, like crystal. Near the throne and around the throne there were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man's, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The four living creatures have each six wings, and around and within they are full of eyes. They cease not saying day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives for the ages of the ages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for the ages of the ages, and they cast their crowns before the throne saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Worthy art thou, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou didst create all things and because of thy will they existed and were created."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
