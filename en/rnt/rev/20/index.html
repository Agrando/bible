After that he must be loosed for a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then I saw thrones, and men took their seats on them and the power to judge was granted to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for God's message, and who had not worshiped the Beast nor his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. They lived and reigned as kings with Christ a thousand years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but the rest of the dead did not return to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection! Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests and kings of God and of Christ, and will reign with him the thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed from his prison</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and will come out to mislead the nations that are at the four corners of the earth \'97 Gog and Magog \'97 and gather them to battle in number like the sand of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They went up over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp of the holy and the beloved city. But fire fell from heaven and consumed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the Devil who was misleading them was flung into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the Beast and the False Prophet, and they will be tormented day and night for the ages of the ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw a great white throne and him who was sitting on it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away and no place was found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. And another book was opened which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged out of what was written in the books according to their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and they were judged each according to his deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Death and Hades were flung into the lake of fire.
