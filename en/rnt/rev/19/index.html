Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>for true and just are his judgments. He has judged the great prostitute who was corrupting the earth with her lewdness and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Again they shouted, "Hallelujah! Her smoke will ascend for the ages of the ages."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the twenty-four elders fell down and the four living creatures worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen! Hallelujah!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A voice came from the throne saying, "Praise our God, all of you his servants who reverence him, both small and great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I heard what seemed like the voices of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters, like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty is king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us rejoice and be glad and give glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride has prepared herself</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and it has been granted to her to be clothed in fine linen shining and pure." For the fine linen is the righteous acts of the holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he said to me, "Write: Blessed are they who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!" He said to me, "These are the true words of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I fell down at his feet and worshiped him. But he said to me, "No, no. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren who hold the testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For testimony to Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw heaven open and there was a white horse, and he who was sitting on it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems. He has a name written which no one but himself knows,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he is clothed in a garment dipped in blood and his name has been called The Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The armies that are in heaven follow him on white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From his mouth issues a sharp sword to smite the nations. He will shepherd them with a rod of iron, and he treads the winepress of the fierce wrath of God Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, "King of kings and Lord of lords."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I saw one angel standing on the sun, and he shouted with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, "Come, gather for the great feast of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of freemen and of slaves, of small and great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to do battle with him who sits on the horse and with his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Beast was captured and with him the False Prophet who did miracles in his presence and thereby misled those who received the mark of the Beast and who worshiped his image. The two were flung alive into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The rest were slain with the sword of him who sits upon the horse, the sword that issued from his mouth, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
