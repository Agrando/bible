The moon was under her feet and on her head was a crown of twelve stars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>She was with child and cried out in the pangs and anguish of child-birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There appeared also another sign in heaven, a great fiery-red Dragon with seven heads and ten horns. On his heads were seven diadems</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and his tail dragged a third of the stars of heaven and hurled them to the ground. The Dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth to a child, so that he might devour the child as soon as it was born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>She gave birth to a son who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron. Then the child was caught up to God and to his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The woman fled into the wilderness where she has from God a prepared place, that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>War arose in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. The Dragon and his angels fought,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but they failed, and no place was found for them any longer in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was hurled down the great Dragon, the ancient serpent who is called the Devil and Satan, who misleads the whole world \'97 he was hurled to the earth and his angels were hurled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I heard a loud voice in heaven say, "Now has come the salvation and power and kingship of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brethren has been hurled down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they have conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of testimony to him, and they loved not their lives even to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, rejoice, O heavens, and you who tent in them! Alas for the land and the sea! For the Devil has gone down to you in great wrath, knowing that he has but a little time."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the Dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the man-child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle to fly into the wilderness to her place, where she shall be fed for a time and times and half a time, hidden from the view of the Serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Serpent poured from his mouth after the woman water like a river, to sweep her away with a flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the earth helped the woman and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river that the Dragon had poured out of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the Dragon was enraged against the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring who keep the commands of God and hold the testimony concerning Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
