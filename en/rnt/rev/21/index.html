He will tent with them and they will be his people and he will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death shall be no more; neither shall there any longer be sorrow or wailing or painful toil; for the first things have passed away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who was sitting on the throne said, "See, I am making all things new." He said, "Write; for these words are trustworthy and true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to me, "They have come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To him who is thirsting I will give from the spring of the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who conquers shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be to me a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the timid and faithless and abominable and murderers and the unchaste and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars will have their lot in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then one of the angels that had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came and spoke with me. "Come here," he said, "and I will show you the Bride, the Lamb's wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he carried me in Spirit to the top of a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like that of a most precious stone, like crystalline jasper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She had a wall great and high, and she had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels, and there were names written upon the gates. They are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On the east were three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wall of the city had twelve foundations and upon them were twelve names, the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who was speaking with me had a golden reed as a measure, to measure the city and her gates and her wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The city stands foursquare and the length is the same as the breadth. He measured the city with the reed. It extends twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He measured the wall of it, a hundred and forty-four cubits by human measure, which is also that of an angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The material of the wall of it was jasper and the city was pure gold like clear glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The foundations of the wall of the city were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I saw no temple in it; for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it; for the glory of God illumines it and the Lamb is its light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and its gates will not be closed by day, and there will be no night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But there will not enter into it anything unholy or any one who makes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
