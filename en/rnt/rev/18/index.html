In the cup she mixed mix double for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As much as she glorified herself and played the wanton, so much give her torture and woe. For in her heart she says, 'I sit here a queen; no widow am I and woe I shall not see.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this reason in one day her plagues will come, death and woe and famine, and she shall be burned up in fire. For strong is the Lord God who has judged her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"The kings of the earth who have committed lewdness with her and have reveled luxuriously, when they see the smoke of her burning, will wail and beat their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Standing afar because of their dismay at her torture, they will say, 'Alas, alas, O great city, Babylon the strong city, for in one hour your doom has come!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The merchants of the earth will weep and wail over her, for no one will any longer buy their cargoes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, all kinds of citrus wood and their many kinds of articles of ivory and their many kinds of articles of costliest wood and brass and iron and marble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon and spice and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine, and olive oil and fine flour and wheat, and cattle and sheep and horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The ripe fruits for which your soul longed have gone from you, and all your dainty and splendid things are lost to you and they will never more be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The traders in these things who grew rich from her will stand afar through dismay at her torture, weeping and wailing</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and saying: 'Alas, alas, for the great city, clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in one hour this vast wealth has given place to desolation.' " Every ship captain and every one who sails anywhere, and sailors and all who gain their living on the sea, stood afar</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and shouted as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, "What city could compare with the great city?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They threw dust upon their heads and shouted as they wept and wailed, saying, "Alas, alas, for the great city in which all who had ships on the sea grew rich from her wealth! For in an hour she has been desolated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you the holy and you apostles and prophets! For God has pronounced sentence in your behalf against her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and hurled it into the sea, saying, "With such violence shall Babylon the great city be hurled down and she will never more be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The music of harpers and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will never more be heard in you. No master of any art will ever more be found in you. The sound of the mill will never more be heard in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The light of a lamp will never more shine in you. The voices of bridegroom and bride will never again be heard in you. Your merchants were the great ones of the earth; for by your magic arts all the nations were led astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In her was found the blood of prophets and of holy men and of all who had been slain on the earth."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
