The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There will no longer be any accursed thing. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him with holy rites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There will not be night any more and they will have no need of lamplight or of sunlight; for the Lord God will shine upon them and they will be kings for the ages of the ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show to his servants what must soon come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I am coming soon. Blessed is he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this book."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I, John, am he who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he said to me, "No, no. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren and of the prophets and of those who are keeping the words of this book. Worship God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book. For the time is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the wrongdoer do wrong still, and let him who is filthy be filthy still, and let the righteous do righteousness still, and let the holy be holy still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I am coming soon and my reward is with me, to pay each in full as his work is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blessed will those be who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the unchaste and the murderers and the idolaters and every one who loves and makes a lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright morning Star."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come." Let him who hears say, "Come." Let him who thirsts come. Let him who will take the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I testify to every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if any one adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and if any one takes away anything from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written of in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who bears this testimony says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen, come, Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
