There was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he opened the pit of the abyss and smoke came up from the pit like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened and the air also by the smoke of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them such as earthly scorpions have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth nor anything green nor any tree, but only the people that did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It was not granted to them to kill such, but to torment them five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In those days men will seek for death and will not find it and will long to die, but death will fly from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold, and their faces were like human faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They had hair like the hair of women. Their teeth were like those of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They had breastplates like breastplates of iron. The noise of their wings was like the noise of many-horsed chariots rushing into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have tails as scorpions have, and stings, and with their tails they have power to harm men five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss, whose name  is in Hebrew Abaddon, but in Greek Apollyon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One woe has passed. Two woes are still to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sixth angel sounded his trumpet and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar before God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, "Loose the four angels that are chained at the great river Euphrates."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the four angels were loosed, they who were prepared for the hour and day and month and year to kill a third of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This is how the horses and those who sat on them appeared to me in the vision: The riders had breastplates, fiery red, dark blue, and sulphur yellow. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By these three plagues a third of men were killed \'97 by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with these they do injury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the rest of men, who were not killed by these plagues, neither repented of the deeds of their hands nor ceased worshiping the demons and their idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor did they repent of their murders nor of their magic nor of their unchastities nor of their thefts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
