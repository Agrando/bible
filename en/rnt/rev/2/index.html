Otherwise I am coming to you and will move your lampstand from its place, if you do not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"To the Angel of the Church in Smyrna write: "These things says the First and the Last, who died and returned to life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know your distress and poverty, but you are rich, and I know the profane words from those who say that they are Jews though they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not fear what you are soon to suffer. The Devil will soon cast some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and you will have distress ten days. Be faithful to death and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"To the Angel of the Church in Pergamum write: "These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know where you live, where the throne of Satan is. Yet you are holding fast my name and did not disown faith in me even in the days when Antipas, my faithful witness, was killed beside you where Satan lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you, because you have some who hold the teaching of Balaam who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel: to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit unchastity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And even you have some who likewise hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent, therefore. Otherwise I am coming to you shortly, and I will make war upon them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"To the Angel of the Church in Thyatira write: "These things says the Son of God, he who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like fine brass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know your works and your love and your faith and your service and your endurance, and that your last works are more than your first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have against you that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and leads astray my servants to commit unchastity and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I gave her time to repent, but she will not repent of her unchastity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>See, I will cast her into a bed and those who commit adultery with her into great distress, unless they repent of their deeds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and her children I will surely kill. All the churches shall know that I am he who searches hearts and will give to each of you according to your deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, as many as do not hold this teaching, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not lay on you any other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But hold fast what you have until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who conquers and keeps my commands to the end \'97 I will give him authority over the nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron, as earthenware is broken to pieces, just as I also have received from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
