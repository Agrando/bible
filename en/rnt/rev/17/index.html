He said, "Come here. I will show you the doom of the great prostitute who sits on many waters</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and with whom the kings of the earth have committed lewdness, while the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk with the wine of her lewdness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast covered with profane names, and with seven heads and ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls. She had in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her lewdness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>On her forehead was written a mysterious name: "Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy and with the blood of the witnesses for Jesus. When I saw her I wondered greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the woman and the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Beast which you saw was and is not and will soon come up out of the abyss and go into destruction. And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life will be amazed when they see the Beast that was and is not and will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Here is need for a mind that has wisdom. "The seven heads are seven mountains upon which the woman sits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also they are seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he comes he must stay but a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Beast which was and is not is also himself an eighth, yet is one of the seven, and will go into destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received kingly power, but they will receive power as kings for one hour with the Beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They have one mind and they give over their power and authority to the Beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They will make war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings. They who are with him, called and chosen and faithful, will also conquer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to me, "The waters that you saw where the prostitute was sitting are peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The ten horns that you saw and the Beast \'97 they hate the prostitute and will make her desolate and naked and they will devour her flesh and will burn her up with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God has put it in their hearts to carry out his purpose, which is that they shall carry out one purpose and give their royal power to the Beast until the words of God are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The woman that you saw is the great city that has kingly power over the kings of the earth."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
