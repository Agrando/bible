  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.
