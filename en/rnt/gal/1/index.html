Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am astonished that you are so quickly changing over from him who called you by the grace of Christ to a different kind of good news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>though it is not another good news. But there are some who are perplexing you and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should bring you any good news different from what we did bring you, let him be accursed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As I said before, I say now again, if any one brings you good news different from what you have received, let him be accursed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Am I now trying to please men or God? If I were still trying to please men I should not be Christ's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I assure you, brethren, that the good news which I brought is not of man's devising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither did I receive it from man nor was I taught it through man, but through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You have heard of my former life in Judaism, that I furiously persecuted the church of God and made havoc of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I went further in Judaism than many of my own age and race, being intensely zealous for the traditions of my forefathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when he who had appointed me when I was in my mother's womb, and had called me by his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>was pleased to reveal his Son in me that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and came back to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I saw no other one of the apostles, though I did see James the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In what I am writing to you, before God I am not lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I was not known by face to the churches of Christ in Judaea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only they had heard that "he who used to persecute us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they glorified God on my account.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
