After beginning with spirit are you now finishing with flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have you suffered such things to no purpose? \'97 if it is to no purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who supplies to you the Spirit and works miracles among you, is he doing it because of works of law or because of hearing with faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>just as Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You know, then, that those who are of faith \'97 they are children of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Scripture, foreseeing that God would declare the Gentiles righteous because of faith, announced the good news in advance to Abraham, "In you all the Gentiles will be blessed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For all who are of the works of law are under a curse, for it is written, "Cursed is every one who does not abide by all the precepts of the book of the Law and do them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But that by law no one is declared righteous before God is plain, because, "He who is righteous by faith shall live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the Law is not of faith, but "He who does these things shall live by them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for our sake, for it is written, "Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in order that the blessing of Abraham might in Jesus Christ come on the Gentiles, that they might receive through faith the promise of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brethren, I am speaking humanly, a ratified covenant, although but a man's, no one can set aside or add to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, "and to offsprings," as meaning many, but as if meaning one, "and to your offspring," who is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I mean this, a covenant ratified by God, the Law that came four hundred and thirty years afterward does not annul, so as to defeat the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance is by law, it is no longer by promise. But God granted it to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then was the Law? It was added later to make transgressions, until the Offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was arranged through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A mediator does not belong to one person, but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the Law then against the promises of God? Never! For if a law had been given which could give life, then really righteousness would have come by law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Scripture has shut up all under sin that the promise based on faith in Jesus Christ may be given to those who have faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Before faith came we were guarded under law, shut up waiting for the faith that was to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus the Law became our tutor leading us to Christ, that we might be declared righteous by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female: for you all are one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring and heirs according to the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
