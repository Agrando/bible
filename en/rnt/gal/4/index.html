You have not wronged me in anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You know that because of weakness of the flesh I told you the good news at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you did not despise or spurn what was a trial to you in my bodily condition, but welcomed me as you would an angel of God, as you would Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where now is the blessing you pronounced on me? For I bear you witness that if it had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are paying court to you, but not honorably. No, they wish to shut you out, so that you may pay court to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is honorable to be courted in an honorable matter always, and not only when I am with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>my children, for whom I again am suffering birth pangs until Christ is formed in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Would that I could be present with you now and could change my tone, for I am at a loss about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who wish to be under law, do you not hear the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one born of the slave girl and one born of the free wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who was born of the slave girl was born according to the flesh, while he who was born of the free wife was born by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is an allegory. For these women are the two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery. This is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She represents the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery along with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem on high is free and she is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, "Rejoice, O barren one, you who do not bear! Break forth and shout, you who feel no birth pangs! For many are the children of the desolate \'97 more than those of her who has a husband."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But you, brethren, are, as Isaac was, children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But just as then he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what says the Scripture? "Cast out the slave girl and her son. For the son of the slave girl shall not inherit along with the son of the free wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, brethren, we are not children of a slave girl, but of the free wife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
