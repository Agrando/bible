But I did this privately before those who were most esteemed, that I might not be running, or have run, to no Purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But even Titus, who was with me and was a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>though it was suggested on account of false brethren who had been brought in, who had crept in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But we did not yield in subjection to them even for an hour, that the truth of the good news might continue with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But from those who were esteemed to be something \'97 whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God does not regard the social standing of a man \'97 those who were most esteemed did not impart to me anything additional.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, on the contrary, seeing that I was entrusted with the good news for the uncircumcision as Peter was for the circumcision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for he who had worked in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcision had worked in me for the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>recognizing the grace given to me, James, Cephas, and John, who were regarded as pillars, gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Only they wished us to remember the poor. This very thing I also was earnest in doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he had been justly censured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For before certain persons came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the rest of the Jews practiced the same hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas was led off with them in their hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when I saw that they were not walking straight according to the truth of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, "If you who are a Jew are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>knowing that a man is not declared righteous because of works of law, but through faith in Christ Jesus, we also have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be declared righteous because of faith in Christ, and not because of works of law, for because of works of law no human being will be declared righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If while seeking to be declared righteous in Christ we ourselves are found sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Never.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if I am building up again what I pulled down, I show myself as a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I through law died to law that I might live to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have been crucified with Christ. I am living, yet no longer I, but Christ is living in me. The life that I am now living in flesh I am living by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not make nothing of the grace of God, for if righteousness is through law, then Christ died for nothing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
