Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The persuasion was not from him who called you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little yeast sets the whole lump fermenting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am persuaded in regard to you in the Lord that you will have no other mind. He who is troubling you must bear his condemnation, whoever he may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I, brethren, if I am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I persecuted? Then the offensiveness of the cross has been done away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Would that those who are troubling you would even cut off all!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not let your freedom be an opportunity for the flesh, but in love be servants to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole Law is summed up in one word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say, walk in the Spirit and you will not carry out the passions of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh has passions contrary to the Spirit and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do whatever you wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The works of the flesh are obvious, such as unchastity, impurity, indecency,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, magic, hatred, strife, jealousy, anger, rivalries, dissensions, factions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envyings, drinking bouts, revelries, and the like. Of these I tell you beforehand, as I have already told you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, slowness to anger, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its emotions and passions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we are living in the Spirit let us direct our lives by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not be vainglorious, irritating one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
