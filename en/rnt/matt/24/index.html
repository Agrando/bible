I tell you truly there will not be left here one stone upon another which will not be thrown down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us when these things will be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus answered them, "Make sure that no one misleads you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in my name and will say, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You will soon hear of wars and rumors of wars. Take care and do not be alarmed, for such things must be; but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes here and there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All of these things are the beginnings of birth-pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they will deliver you up to persecution and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the Gentiles on account of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then many will stumble and fall and will betray one another and will hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and because of the wide spread of lawlessness the love of most will grow cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who endures to the end, he will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed in all the inhabited world for a testimony to all the Gentiles. And then will come the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"So when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy placeLet the reader understand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then those who are in Judaea are to flee to the mountains;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>he who is on the house is not to go down to take the things out of his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he who is in the field is not to turn back and take his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Alas, for the women with child and the nursing mothers in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pray that your flight may not be in the winter nor on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there will be then great suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Unless those days had been shortened none would be saved; but for the sake of the chosen those days will be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if any one says to you, 'See, here is the Christ,' or 'here,' do not believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See, I have told you beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So, if they say to you, 'He is in the wilderness,' do not go out there. If they say, 'in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as the lightning comes out of the east and shines across to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherever the carcass is, there will the vultures flock together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of heaven will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. Then will all the tribes of the earth beat their breasts for grief, and they will see the Son of Man as he comes on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet-blast, and they will gather his chosen from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"From the fig tree take an illustration. When now its branch becomes soft and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Just so when you see all these things, know that he is near \'97 at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away before all these things happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, not even the Son, but the Father alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For, as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah went into the ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then there will be two men in the field. One will be taken with him and one will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There will be two women grinding at the mill. One will be taken with him and one will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Watch, therefore, for you do not know what day your Master is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But this you do know, that if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Therefore be you also ready, for in an hour that you do not think the Son of Man is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant whom the master has placed over his household to give them food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>I tell you truly that he will place him over all that he owns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that wicked servant says in his heart, 'My master is delaying,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and begins to strike his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting and at an hour when he is unaware,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and will cut him asunder and assign his part with the hypocrites. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
