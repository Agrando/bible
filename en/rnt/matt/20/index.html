So they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again he went out about noon and about three o'clock and did the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>About five o'clock he went out and found others standing and said to them, 'Why have you been standing the whole day idle?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go too into my vineyard.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay their hire, beginning with the last and going on to the first.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When those who were hired about five o'clock came, they received a shilling apiece,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and when those who were hired first came, they thought that they would get more. But they too received a shilling apiece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they received it, they grumbled at the householder</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and said, 'These last worked one hour and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the heat.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not wronging you. Did you not agree with me for a shilling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Have I not the right to do what I will with my own? Is your eye evil because I am good?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the last will be first and the first last."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside on the road and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the high priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify, and on the third day he will be raised."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing down to him and making a request of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said to her, "What do you wish?" She said to him, "Give the command for these two sons of mine to sit one on your right and one on your left in your kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, 'We can?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, "My cup you will drink, but seats on my right and on my left are not mine to give. They will be given to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the ten heard of this, they were indignant at the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great ones wield power over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It is not so among you. But whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whoever wants to be first among you will be your slave;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>just as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As they were leaving Jericho, a great crowd followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Two blind men were sitting at the side of the road, and when they heard that Jesus was passing, they cried out, "Sir, have pity on us, Son of David!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The crowd rebuked them and told them to be silent. But all the more they cried, "Sir, have pity on us, Son of David!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus stopped and called them and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said, "We want our eyes opened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes, and at once they regained sight and followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
