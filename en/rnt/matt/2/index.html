For we saw his star in the East and have come to do homage to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When King Herod heard it, he was disturbed, and so was all Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then he called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They said to him, "In Bethlehem, in Juda. For so it was written by the prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>'And thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means least among the leaders of Judah; for from thee will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them exactly the time of the star's appearance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and as he sent them to Bethlehem he said, "Go and make careful inquiries about the child, and when you have found him bring me word, so that I too may come and do homage to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After hearing the king, they journeyed on, and the star which they had seen in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they saw the star, they were very joyful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and did him homage. Then they opened their treasures and presented to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and so went by another mad back to their own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph and said, "Rise up, and take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell you, for Herod will search for the child in order to kill him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Joseph rose up, and took the child and his mother in the night and went away to Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and was there until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, "Out of Egypt I called my Son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod, seeing that he had been outwitted by the wise men, became furious, and sent out and killed all the boy babies two years old and under in Bethlehem and all its neighborhood, guided by the date which he had carefully learned from the wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But after Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and said, "Arise, and take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought the child's life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he arose, and took the child and his mother and came into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being directed in a dream he went away to the region of Galilee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and settled in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Nazarene."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
