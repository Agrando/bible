For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came to the stone and rolled it away and sat upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His appearance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For fear of him the guards trembled violently and became like dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The angel said to the women, "Do not you be afraid. For I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here. He has been raised, as he told you. Come see the place where he lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go quickly and tell his disciples that he has been raised from the dead. He will precede you to Galilee. There you will see him. See, I have told you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Hail!" They came up and clasped his feet and bowed down before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and take the message to my disciples to go away to Galilee and there they will see me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While they were going, some of the guard came into the city and brought word to the high priests of all that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After assembling with the elders and holding a consultation, they gave a good deal of money to the soldiers</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said, "Say, 'His disciples came in the night and stole him away while we were asleep,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if this comes to the ears of the Governor we will persuade him and free you from trouble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this report has been spread among the Jews to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed to meet them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they saw him and bowed down before him; but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus came to them and talked with them. He said, "To me has been given all authority in heaven and on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to keep all the commands that I have given you. And, behold, I am with you all the days to the end of the world."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
