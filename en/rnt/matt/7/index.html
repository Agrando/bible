For wide and spacious is the road that leads away to ruin, and many there are who go through it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but narrow is the gate and contracted is the road that leads into life, and few there are who find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Beware of false prophets, such as come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From their fruits you will know them. Are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Just so every good tree yields fine fruit, but a worthless tree yields bad fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is not possible for a good tree to yield had fruit nor for a worthless tree to yield fine fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that does not yield fine fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So then, from their fruits you will know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Not every one who says to me, 'Master, Master,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me on that day, 'Master, Master, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name east out demons, and in your name do many miracles?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work lawlessness.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Every one, therefore, who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the rain descended and the rivers rose and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house; but it fell not, for it had been founded on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain descended and the rivers rose and the winds blew, and they struck upon that house and it fell, and great was the ruin of it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Jesus ended these words, the crowds were astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he taught them like one who had authority, and not as their scribes taught.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
