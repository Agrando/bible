For they say and do not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and make their tassels large.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They love the best couches at dinners and the front seats in the synagogues</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and salutations in the markets and to be called by men Rabbi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But do not you be called Rabbi. For one is your Teacher and all of you are brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And do not call any one on earth Father, for one is your Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Neither be called guides, for your Guide is one alone \'97 the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The greatest of you will be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"But alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut the kingdom of heaven before men. You yourselves do not enter nor do you permit those who are entering to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is won you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Alas for you, blind guides! You say, 'Whoever swears by the Temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the Temple is bound.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools and blind, which is greater, the gold or the Temple that makes the gold holy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You say, 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You blind, which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He, then, who swears by the altar swears by it and everything on it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he who swears by the Temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithes of mint, dill, and carraway and have disregarded the weightier matters of the law \'97 justice and kindness and good faith.
