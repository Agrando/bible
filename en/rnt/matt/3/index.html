Then he permitted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus, as soon as he was baptized, went up from the water, and the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A voice from the heavens said, "This is my Son, the beloved in whom I delight."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
