A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? Those who wear soft clothes are in kings' palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is the one of whom it was written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I tell you truly there has not arisen among those born of women a greater than John the Baptist. But any inferior in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been suffering violence and violent men have been seizing it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you are willing to believe it, he is Elijah who was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever has ears, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"To what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market-places who call to the others,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>'We played the flute to you and you did not dance; we mourned and you did not beat your breasts.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'See a glutton and a wine-drinker; a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' Yet wisdom is proved to be in the right by her works."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had been done, because they had not repented:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if in Tyre and Sidon the miracles had been done which were done in you, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum! No, you will not be exalted to heaven. You will be abased to Hades. Because if those miracles which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus said, "I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them to babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, Father, I thank thee that such was thy good pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"All things have been delivered tome by my Father, and no one knows the Son but the Father, nor does any one know the Father but the Son and he to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
