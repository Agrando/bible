When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, "Have courage, boy, your sins are forgiven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>At once some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is speaking profane words."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why are you thinking evil thoughts in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" \'97 then he said to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed and go to your house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thereupon he rose and went away to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The crowds that saw it were astonished and gave glory to God, who had given such power to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As Jesus was passing along from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. Jesus said to him, "Follow me," and he arose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It happened that, while he was reclining at table in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came in and reclined at the table with Jesus and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus heard it and said, "The strong have no need of a physician, but the sick have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go and learn what this means: 'I wish for kindness, and not for sacrifice.' I have not come to call righteous people, but sinners."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "Why are we and the Pharisees fasting while your disciples are not fasting?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said, "Can the bridal party fast while the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for the filling pulls away from the cloak and the result is a worse tear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor do they pour new wine into old wine-skins, for if they do the skins burst. So the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wine-skins and both are preserved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While Jesus was talking to them, a synagogue Director came and bowed down before him and said, "My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand upon her and she will live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Suddenly a woman who had been suffering for twelve years from hemorrhage came up behind him and touched the tassel of his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she said to herself, "If I touch only his cloak, I shall be healed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus turned and, seeing her, said, "Courage, daughter, your faith has healed you." The woman was cured from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus entered the house of the Director and saw the flute-players and the crowd that was noisily lamenting, and he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Leave the room, for the girl is not dead; she is sleeping." They laughed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But after the crowd had been turned out, he went in and took hold of her hand and the girl rose up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The report of this spread through all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As Jesus was going along from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have pity on us, Son of David."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After he had entered the house, these blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They said, "Yes, Sir."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith be it to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly commanded them, "Be sure and let no one know of this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they went out and spread his fame through all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they were going out, a dumb man who was also a demoniac was brought to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke. The crowd wondered and said, "Never was anything like this seen in Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees said, "Through the Chief of the demons he casts out the demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus made a circuit through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Seeing the crowds, he was touched with compassion for them, for they were torn and flung down like sheep that have no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is great, but the laborers are few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pray to the Master of the harvest to rush out laborers into his harvest."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
