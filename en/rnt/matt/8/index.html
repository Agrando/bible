Instantly his leprosy was cleansed away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus said to him, "Be sure and do not say a word to any one, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift which Moses prescribed as evidence for them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Jesus had entered Capernaum there came to him a Centurion who implored his help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Sir," he said, "my servant lies in my house a paralytic, in great distress."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Centurion answered, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but just speak the word and my servant will be cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I am a man, \'97 under authority, \'97 with soldiers under me, and I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said, "Truly I tell you, I have not found so great faith on the part of any one in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I tell you many will come from the east and from the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the darkness outside. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus said to the Centurion, "Go. As you have believed, so be it to you." His servant was healed that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus entered the house of Peter, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He touched her hand and the fever left her. Then she arose and waited upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When evening came, they brought to him many demoniacs and he cast out the spirits by a word, and all their sick he healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, "He took our weaknesses and bore away our diseases."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave directions to go over to the other side of the lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then a certain scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have coverts, but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Another of his disciples said to him, "Sir, let me first go and bury my father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Soon a great storm broke on the lake so that the boat was hidden under the waves; but he was sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>His disciples came to him and woke him and said, "Master, save us. We are going down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he said, "Why are you frightened, you men of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the lake, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The men were astonished and said, "What sort of a person is this, whom even the winds and the lake obey?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he arrived at the other side, the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two demoniacs coming out of the tombs. They were very fierce, so that no one was able to pass along that road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Suddenly they shouted, "Son of God, what have you to do with us? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The demons begged him, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He said to them, "Go." So they went out and entered into the swine. Then suddenly the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The herdsmen fled and went away to the town and told everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then at once all the town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him they begged him to depart from their neighborhood.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
