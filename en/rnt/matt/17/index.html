His face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Peter said to Jesus, "Sir, it is fine for us to be here. If you like, I will make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While he was speaking, a bright cloud suddenly overspread them and a voice issued from the cloud, "This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight. Hear him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The disciples on hearing this fell on their faces in great terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus came and touched them and said, "Rise and do not be afraid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As they were descending the mountain, Jesus charged them, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, "Elijah does come and restore all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I tell you Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they chose. Just so the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When they reached the crowd, a man came to Jesus and knelt to him and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Sir, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic and is in a very bad way. For often he falls into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I brought him to your disciples and they could not cure him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answered, "O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long must I be with you? How long must I bear you? Bring him here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out of him and the boy was well from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus aside and said, "Why were we unable to cast it out?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them, "Because of your lack of faith. I tell you truly, if you have faith like a mustard seed you will say to this mountain, 'Remove from here to there,' and it will remove, and nothing will be impossible for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they were assembling in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will soon be betrayed into the hands of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they will kill him and on the third day he will be raised"; and they were deeply distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After they came to Capernaum, the men who were collecting the Temple tax came to Peter and said, "Does not your teacher pay the Temple tax?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, "Yes." But when he went into the house Jesus spoke first to him and said, "How do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes or tribute, from their own sons or from those who are not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Upon his saying, "From those who are not," Jesus said to him, "So then the sons are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But in order that we may not mislead them, go to the lake and throw in a hook and take the first fish that comes up. When you open his mouth you will find a coin. Take that and give it to them for me and yourself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
