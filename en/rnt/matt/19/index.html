They said, "Is it allowable for a man to divorce his wife for any and every cause?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He replied, "Have you not read that the Creator in the beginning 'made them male and female,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said, 'For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What, therefore, God has yoked together let not man put asunder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, "Why, then, did Moses command to give a writing of dismissal and divorce her?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, "Moses, because of your hard-heartedness, permitted you to divorce your wives, but at the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another, commits adultery."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples said to him, "If this is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to them, "Not all can receive this word; but only those to whom it is granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs so born from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs so made by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who is able to receive it receive it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then some little children were brought to him to have him lay his hands on them and pray. His disciples rebuked those who brought them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After laying his hands on them, he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A man came to him and said, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do to have life eternal?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to him, "Why do you ask me about the good? One only is the Good. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him, "Which?" Jesus said to him, "Thou shalt not commit murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honor thy father and thy mother, and Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to him, "All these I have kept. What do I lack still?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be perfect, go sell your property and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and then come, follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the young man heard that saying, he went away grieved. For he possessed great wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you truly, a rich man will with difficulty enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the disciples heard this, they were amazed and said, "Who then can be saved?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter said, "Why, we have left everything and have followed you. What then shall we receive?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to him, "I tell you truly, you who have followed me, in the rebirth, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And whoever has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my name's sake will receive manifold more and will inherit life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many now first will be last and many now last will be first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
