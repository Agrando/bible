Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many basketfuls you picked up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many basketfuls you picked up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How is it that you do not perceive that I was not speaking to you about bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that he had told them to beware not of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After corning into the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They said, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; others Jeremiah or some one of the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, "But you, who do you say that I am?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood have not revealed it to you, but my Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse note empty"><a name="18">18</a>And I tell you that you are Peter [which means Rock], and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he strictly charged his disciples not to tell any one that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time Jesus began to make plain to his disciples that he had to go away to Jerusalem, and suffer greatly from the elders and high priests and scribes, and be killed and on the third day be raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Peter took him and began to reprove him, saying, "Please God, Sir; this shall not happen to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he, turning, said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan; you are a snare to me, for you are not thinking God's thoughts, but men's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If any one chooses to come after me, let him disown self and take up his cross and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever chooses to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what profit will a man have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? or what can a man give to buy back his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of Man will soon come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will repay each in full according to his actions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I tell you truly there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste of death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
