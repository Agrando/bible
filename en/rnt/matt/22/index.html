He said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"The kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who made a wedding feast for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, but they would not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he sent other servants, telling them, 'Say to those who have been invited, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fat things have been killed and everything is ready. Come to the wedding.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they paid no attention, and went off one to his field and another to his trading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The rest seized his servants, treated them roughly, and killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the king grew angry and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go out on the crossroads, and every one you find invite to the wedding.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So those servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding-hall was filled with guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the king came in to look over the guests, he saw there a man who was not dressed in a wedding robe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding robe?' But he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The king said to the attendants, 'Bind him feet and hands and throw him out into the darkness outside.' There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are invited, but few are chosen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and held a consultation how they could entrap him in talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They sent to him their disciples with the Herodians and they said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and that you are afraid of no one, for you do not regard the social standing of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us therefore what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus knew their wickedness and said, "Why are you trying to test me, you hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me a piece of tax money." They brought him a shilling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He asked them, "Whose head is this, and whose inscription?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said, "Caesar's." He said to them, "Then pay to Caesar what is Caesar's, and pay to God what is God's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they heard this, they wondered and left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On that day some Sadducees came to him asserting that there is no resurrection, and they asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Teacher, Moses said, 'If any man dies childless, his brother shall marry his widow and raise up offspring for his brother.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died childless and left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So did the second and the third down to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The woman died last of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In the resurrection, then, which of the seven will have the wife? For they all had her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus replied to them, "You are all astray because you do not understand either the Scriptures or the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither many nor are married, but are like the angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But in reference to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>'I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of dead men, but of living men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The crowd on hearing this were amazed at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and one of them, a lawyer, in order to test him, asked,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Teacher, which commandment in the law is greatest?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, " 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the greatest and first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The second is like it, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them a question,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"What do you think in regard to the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said, "David's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said, "How then does David by inspiration call him 'Lord,' saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David calls him 'Lord,' how is he his son?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>No one was able to answer him a word, and no one from that day dared ask him any more questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
