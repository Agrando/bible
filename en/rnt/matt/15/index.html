For they do not wash their hands when they eat food."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He answered them, "And why do you violate the command of God for the sake of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God said, 'Honor thy father and thy mother,' and, 'If any one speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or to his mother, Whatever benefit you get from me is now dedicated to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he shall not honor his father or his mother.' So you have nullified the command of God for the sake of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>'This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In vain they worship me while they teach as precepts the commands of men.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Calling the crowd to him he said to them, "Hear and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not what enters the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth \'97 that defiles a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked when they heard what you said?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He replied, "Every plant which my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Beware of them. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind leads the blind, both will fall into the ditch."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Peter said, "Explain to us your figure."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered, "Are even you without insight?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not know that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is cast out into the sewer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart, and they defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For from the heart proceed wicked thoughts, murders, adulteries, unchastities, thefts, perjuries, profane words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Leaving that place, Jesus retired into the region of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Here a Canaanite woman of those parts came out and cried, "Sir, have pity on me, Son of David. My daughter is terribly tormented by a demon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; she keeps calling out behind us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He replied, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But she came and bowed before him and said, "Help me, Sir."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He answered, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, "Yes, Sir; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus said to her, "O woman, great is your faith. Be it to you as you will." And her daughter was cured from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>On leaving there, Jesus came along by the lake of Galilee and went up on the mountain and sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then a great crowd came to him having with them lame men, maimed men, blind men, mutes, and many others, and they laid them at his feet and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The crowd was astonished when they saw mutes talking, maimed men sound, lame men walking about, and blind men seeing, and they gave glory to the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for the crowd, for they have now been with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away fasting; they might faint on the road."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples said to him, "Where can we get enough bread in this uninhabited place to feed such a crowd?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said, "How many loaves have you?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fishes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he told the crowd to recline on the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and broke them and gave to his disciples, and the disciples distributed to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All ate and were satisfied, and they picked up seven baskets full of fragments that were left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There were four thousand men that ate, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then after dismissing the crowd he got into a boat and came into the region of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
