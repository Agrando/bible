She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You have the poor with you always, but me you will not have always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For in pouring this ointment on my body she prepared me for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I tell you truly wherever this good news shall be proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be spoken of too in memory of her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the high priests</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and asked, "What will you give me if I betray him to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that moment he kept seeking a favorable time to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Where do you wish us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He answered, "Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When evening had come, he was reclining at table with the twelve disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>While they were eating, he said, "I tell you truly one of you will betray me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Greatly grieved, they began to ask him, each in turn, "It is not I, Master?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He answered, "He who dipped his band with me in the dish is the one who will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of Man is going as it has been written of him, but alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! For that man it would be good not to have been born."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas the traitor asked, "It is not I, Rabbi?" Jesus replied, "It is you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf and blessed it and broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it. This is my body."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you, new, in the kingdom of my Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will stumble and fail me to-night; for it is written, 'I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am raised, I will precede you to Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter answered him, "Though all stumble and fail you, I never will stumble and fail."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, "I tell you truly that to-night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not disown you." And so said all of the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go and pray yonder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sad, even to death. Stay here and watch with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as thou wilt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "So you could not watch one hour with me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray so as not to enter into temptation. Your spirit is eager, but your flesh is weak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again a second time he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he left them and went away again and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "You are sleeping on and resting! Now has come the hour when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Up, let us be going. Here comes my betrayer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the high priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The traitor had given them a sign, saying, "The one I kiss is he. Arrest him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Immediately he came up to Jesus and said, "Good evening, Rabbi," and kissed him affectionately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you are here for." Then they came and laid their hands on Jesus and arrested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Suddenly one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Do you think that I cannot call on my Father and have him send to me now more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that so it must be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out to seize me as if against a robber, with swords and clubs? Every day I sat in the Temple teaching and you did not arrest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this has happened that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The men who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the High Priest, at whose house the scribes and elders had assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Peter followed him at a distance as far as the court of the High Priest, and went in and sat among the attendants to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The high priests and the whole council sought for false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But they did not find any, although many false witnesses came. Finally, two came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, "This man said, 'I can pull down the Temple of God and in three days build it up again.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>The High Priest rose and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is it that these are testifying to against you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus kept silence. The High Priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, "I am he. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the High Priest rent his garments, saying, "Impious words! Why do we any longer need witnesses? See, you have now heard his impious words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What do you think?" They answered, "He deserves death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Some slapped him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, "Act the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you? "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Peter was sitting outside in the court. A maid came up to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilaean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it before all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Then again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>After a little those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, "Truly you are one of them, for your accent proves it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man." Immediately the cock crew, and</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>Peter remembered what Jesus had said, "Before the cock crows you will disown me three times," and he went out and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
