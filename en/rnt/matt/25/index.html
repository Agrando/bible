Come out to meet him!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those maidens arose and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise answered, 'There may not be enough for us and you. Go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>While they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding, and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterwards came the rest of the maidens, saying, 'Master, Master, open for us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he answered, 'I tell you truly I do not know you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch, therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"It is just as when a man going abroad called his servants and committed to them his property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his particular ability. Then he went abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At once he who received the five talents went and traded with them and gained five more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the same way he who received the two gained two more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After a long time the master of those servants came and had an accounting with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The man who had received the five talents came and brought five talents more, saying, 'Master, you committed to me five talents; see, I have gained five talents more.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will place you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The man who had received the two talents came and said, 'Master, you committed to me two talents; see, I have gained two talents more.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant, you have been faithful over a few things, I will place you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the man who had received the one talent came and said, 'Master, I knew that you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not thresh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground. There, you have your own.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>His master replied, 'You wicked and idle servant. Did you know that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not thresh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then you ought to have turned over my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take from him the talent and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to every one who has will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the worthless servant throw out into the darkness outside. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and all the nations will be assembled before him. And he will divide them one from another as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will place the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then will the King say to those on his right hand, 'Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you cared for me. I was in prison and you came to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then will the righteous answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see you a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The King will answer, 'I tell you truly, inasmuch as you did it to one of these my brothers \'97 even the least \'97 you did it to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the fire eternal prepared for the Devil and his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I was hungry and you gave me no food; I was thirsty and you gave me no drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger and you did not take me in; naked and you did not clothe me; sick and in prison and you did not care for me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then they too will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not serve you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He will answer them, 'I tell you truly inasmuch as you did not do it to one of these least, you did not do it to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These will go away into punishment eternal, but the righteous into life eternal."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
