He has risen from the dead and so miraculous powers are working in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Herod had arrested John and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Although he wished to kill him, he was afraid of the people because they held him for a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst and pleased Herod,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so that he promised with an oath that he would give her whatever she asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She, prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The king was grieved, but on account of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The head was brought in on a platter and was given to the girl and she bore it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The disciples of John came and took the body and buried it, and then they came and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Upon hearing of it, Jesus went away in a boat privately to an uninhabited place. But the people heard of it and followed him by land from the towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As he got out of the boat, he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When evening had come on, his disciples came to him and said, "This is an uninhabited place and the time is already late; send away the crowd so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. Give them food yourselves."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They said to him, "We have here nothing but five loaves and two fishes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, "Bring them to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he commanded the crowd to recline on the grass, and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looked up to heaven and asked a blessing. Then he broke up the loaves and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples distributed to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All ate and had abundance, and they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that remained over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he made his disciples get into the boat and go on across while he was dismissing the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After dismissing the crowd, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray, When evening came, he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The boat was already far out from land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified, saying that it was a ghost, and they cried out with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But at once Jesus spoke to them and said, "Courage. It is I. Do not be afraid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter answered, "Sir, if it is you, bid me to come to you on the water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said, "Come." Then Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But seeing the wind he became frightened, and, beginning to sink, he cried out, "Sir, save me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At once Jesus stretched out his hand and grasped him and said, "O man of little faith, why did you doubt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>After they got into the boat, the wind stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the men in the boat bowed down to him and said, "Truly you are the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Having crossed, they came to land at Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When the men of that place recognized him, they sent into all that neighborhood and brought to him all the sick</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and begged him that they might touch merely the tassel of his cloak, and all who touched were cured.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
