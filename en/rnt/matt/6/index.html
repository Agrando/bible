Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When you give gifts of mercy, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be honored by men. I assure you they get their payment in full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But you, when you are giving a gift of mercy, must not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that your gift may be in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will repay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"When you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so as to be seen by men. I assure you they get their payment in full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you, when you pray, go into your inner room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"When praying do not keep repeating, as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard because of their multitude of words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you have need of before you ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Pray in this way: 'Our Father in heaven, Thy name be kept holy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thy kingdom come; Thy will prevail; As in heaven, so on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Our bread for the coming day Give us to-day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our failures As we forgive those who fail toward us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And bring us not into trial, But save us from evil.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you forgive men their wrongdoings, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if you do not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your wrongdoings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"When you fast, do not wear gloomy faces as hypocrites do. For they disfigure their faces so as to be seen by men to be fasting. I assure you they get their payment in full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But you, when fasting, anoint your head and wash your face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so as not to appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust corrode and where thieves break in and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrodes and where thieves do not break in nor steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is clear your whole body will be lighted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but if your eye is bad your whole body will be darkened. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great the darkness is!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your physical life \'97 what you are to eat or what you are to drink; nor about your body \'97 what you are to wear. Is not the life more than the food and the body more than the clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But who of you by being anxious can add to his height one foot?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, bow they grow. They neither toil nor spin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If God so clothes the herbage of the field, to-day growing and to-morrow thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of so little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So do not be anxious, saying, What are we to eat? or, What are we to drink? or, What are we to wear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all these things the pagans seek after. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But you must seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be supplied to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Do not be anxious about to-morrow, for to-morrow will take care of itself. Enough for the day is its own trouble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
