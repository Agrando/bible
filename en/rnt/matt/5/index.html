For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Blessed are they that mourn! For they will be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Blessed are the gentle! For they will inherit the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness! For they will have abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Blessed are the compassionate! For they will receive compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Blessed are the pure in heart! For they will see God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Blessed are the peacemakers! For they will be called sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and say every evil thing against you falsely for my sake!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt becomes flat, with what can it be salted? It is good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hidden if set on a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>People do not light a lamp and put it under a peck-measure, but on the stand, and it gives light for all in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to do away with them, but to fill them full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or part of a letter will pass away from the Law, until all is done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever breaks one of these commandments, the least of them, and teaches men to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, and whoever does them and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say to you that, unless your righteousness far exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'Thou shalt not commit murder. Whoever commits murder shall answer for it to the court.'</span> <span class="verse note empty"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall answer for it to the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'Raca' [empty-head], shall answer for it to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool' shall answer for it in the Gehenna of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So then if you are bringing your gift to lay on the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar and go, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Get on good terms with your adversary quickly while you are on the road with him, for fear that he may deliver you to the judge and the judge may deliver you to the officer and you may be cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Truly I tell you you will not come out until you pay the last penny."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"You have heard that it was said, 'Thou shalt not commit adultery.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman with lustful thoughts has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If your right eye is a snare to you, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members should be lost and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand is a snare to you, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you that one of your members should be lost and not your whole body go into Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"It was said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, unless for the cause of unchastity, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Again, you have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is God's throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, because it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>nor must you swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your yes be yes and your no be no. Whatever is more than these is from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I tell you not to resist a wicked man, but if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him also the other;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and if any one is determined to sue you for your tunic, let him have your cloak too;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and if any one commandeers you for a mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>To him who begs, give; from him who wishes to borrow of you, do not turn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"You have heard that it was said, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun to rise upon the bad and the good, and sends rain upon the just and the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not also the tax collectors do the same thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you salute your brothers only, what superiority have you? Do not the Gentiles do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You must be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
