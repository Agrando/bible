During those days he ate nothing, and when they were ended he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The Devil said to him, "If you are God's Son, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Devil led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and said to him, "To you I will give all this power and glory, for it has been handed over to me and I give it to whomever I will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you do homage before me, all shall be yours."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God and him alone shalt thou worship.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Devil took him to Jerusalem and placed him on the roof of the Temple, and said to him, "If you are God's Son, throw yourself down,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for it is written, 'He will command his angels to guard you,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you shall not strike your foot against a stone.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus answered him, "It has been said, 'Thou shalt not try the Lord thy God.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After exhausting every kind of temptation, the Devil went away from him till a better opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and reports about him went out through all the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He came to Nazareth where he had been brought up, and, according to his custom, went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book and found the place where it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to captives and sight to the blind, to set at liberty the crushed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to proclaim the favored year of the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he rolled up the book and handed it over to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He began and said to them, "To-day this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All bore witness to him, and wondered at the gracious words that came from his mouth, and said, "Is not he a son of Joseph?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, "Of course, you will quote to me the saying, 'Physician, heal yourself.' 'Whatever we have heard of as done in Capernaum, do here in your native place.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He continued: "I tell you truly no prophet is acceptable in his native place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In truth I tell you, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah the prophet, when heaven was shut up three years and six months so that a great famine came on all the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>yet to no widow was Elijah sent except to one in Zarephath, in Sidonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and no leper was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Upon hearing these words, all in the synagogue were filled with rage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and they rose up and expelled him from the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, intending to throw him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he passed through the midst of them and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. There he was teaching them on the Sabbath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they were amazed at his teaching, because he spoke with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of an impure demon, and he shouted with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Ha, what have you to do with us, Nazarene Jesus? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are \'97 The Holy One of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him." The demon flung him prostrate in the midst, but came out of him without injuring him at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Astonishment fell upon all, and they talked to one another, saying, "What is this word? With authority and power he commands the impure spirits and they come out!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Reports about him spread into every part of that region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus arose and left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon. Simon's wife's mother was suffering from a severe fever, and they asked him to help her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He came and stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her. At once she rose up and waited upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As the sun was setting, all who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he put his hands on each of them and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Demons came out of many, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and did not permit them to speak, for they knew that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When morning came, he went out and departed to a solitary place. The crowds were looking for him and came to where he was and tried to hinder his going away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But he said to them, "I must tell the good news about the kingdom of God in the other cities also, because for this I have been sent."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he continued teaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
