And what will be the sign when they are about to happen?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said, "Be on your guard against being misled. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is at hand.' Do not follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when you hear of wars and disorders, do not be terrified. For these things must take place first, but the end will not come immediately."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and there will be great earthquakes in various places, and pestilences and famines and terrors and great portents from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and into prisons, dragging you before kings and governors because of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It will turn out your opportunity for testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Settle it, then, in your hearts not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your opponents will be unable to resist or reply to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will be betrayed by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and you will be hated by all on account of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet not a hair of your head will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By your endurance you will win your lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"But when you see Jerusalem encircled by camps, then know that her desolation is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then those who are in Judaea are to flee to the mountains, and those in the midst of it are to depart, and those in the country places must not come into the city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for these are days of vengeance, that all the prophecies may be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Alas for the women with child and the nursing mothers in those days!
