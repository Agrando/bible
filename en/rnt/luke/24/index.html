Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and rise on the third day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they remembered his words</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and turned back from the tomb and told all this to the eleven and all the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them also told these things to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But these reports seemed in their eyes like idle talk. They did not believe the women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb and stooping down he saw nothing but the linen cloths, and he went away to his place wondering at what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On that day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, seven miles distant from Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and they were talking to each other about all these occurrences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It happened as they talked and discussed that Jesus himself drew near and walked along with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes were restrained from recognizing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to them, "What are these matters that you are debating with each other as you walk?" They stood still with sad faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>One of them, named Cleopas, said to him, "Are you a stranger living alone in Jerusalem and do you not know the things that have happened there in recent days?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said to them, "What things?" They said to him, "The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>how our high priests and leading men handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we were hoping that he was the one who was to redeem Israel. But now, however, the third day is passing since these things took place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet some women from our company amazed us. They went at dawn to the tomb</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and did not find his body, but came back saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some of our company went out to the tomb and found things as the women had said, but they did not see him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to them, "O men lacking insight and slow in heart to believe all that the prophets spoke!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter into his glory?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things about himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They drew near to the village where they were going and he acted as if he were going on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the sun is already low." So he went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he reclined at table with them, he took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; but he vanished from their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us when he was talking to us on the road and was explaining the Scriptures to us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then, rising that very hour, they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their associates assembled</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and saying, "Really the Lord has risen and he has appeared to Simon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They then narrated what had happened on the road and how they knew him by his breaking the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While they were talking of these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said to them, "Peace be with you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were terrified and much alarmed, and thought that they were seeing a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he said to them, "Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See my hands and my feet \'97 that it is I myself. Feel me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me having."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Saying this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While they still were doubting for joy and wondering, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he took it and ate before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He said to them, "This is what I said to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and he said to them, "Thus it is written that the Christ is to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and in his name change of heart for forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And, see, I am sending upon you the promise of my Father. But you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He led them out as far as Bethany and lifted up his hands and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>While he was blessing them he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They bowed down before him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were constantly in the Temple courts blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
