His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But they had no child, for Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It happened that as Zacharias was performing his priestly duties before God in the order of his course,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him to enter the Temple of the Lord and offer the incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the congregation of people was in prayer outside, at the hour of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Zacharias, on seeing him, was alarmed and fear fell upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the angel said to him, "Do not fear, Zacharias, for your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son, and you will call his name John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he will be great before the Lord. He will not drink wine or strong drink. He will be full of the Holy Spirit even from his birth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and many of the sons of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Zacharias said to the angel, "By what proof shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The angel answered, "I am Gabriel, who stands before the face of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to give you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that this comes to pass, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The people were waiting for Zacharias and wondering at his staying so long in the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the Temple. He kept making signs to them and remained dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When the days of his priestly service were finished, he went away to his home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself five months, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"So has the Lord done for me in the days in which he has looked upon me to take away my reproach among men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The name of the virgin was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The angel entered and said to her, "Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But she was alarmed at his words, and wondered what such a greeting could mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The angel said to her, "Do not fear, Mary; for you have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You will conceive in your womb and will bear a son, and you must call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will be king over the house of Jacob through the ages, and of his kingdom there will be no end."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am not united to a man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Highest will overshadow you. For that reason the child that is begotten will be called holy, Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, indeed, Elizabeth your relative, even she, has conceived a son, in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For "no word that comes from God will fail."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Mary said, "Here I am, the Lord's handmaid. Let it be to me according to your word." Then the angel left her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill-country to a city of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and spoke out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But why do I have the honor of having the mother of my Lord come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For, indeed, when the sound of your greeting fell upon my ears, the babe leapt for joy in my womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a complete fulfillment of the things spoken to her from the Lord!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Mary said: "My soul magnifies the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Because he has looked upon the low estate of his handmaid. Indeed, from this time all generations will call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because the Mighty One has done great things for me. Holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>His kindness is from generation to generation upon those who fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He shows strength with his arm; He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He casts down princes from their thrones and raises up the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The hungry he fills with good things and the affluent he sends away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He brings help to Israel his servant, mindful of kindness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>just as he promised our fathers, Abraham and his descendants, forever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>When Elizabeth's due time came, she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great kindness to her, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But his mother said, "No, but he shall be called John."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>They said to her, "There is no one of your family who is called by that name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then they made signs to his father to know what he wanted him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>He asked for a tablet and wrote, "His name is John." They all wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>At once Zacharias's mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he spoke, praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Awe fell on all their neighbors, and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these matters were talked about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>All who heard them laid them up in their minds, saying, "What then will this child be?" For the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Zacharias, his father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and said prophetically:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! For he has looked upon his people, and made deliverance for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>As he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all those that hate us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Dealing kindly with our forefathers, mindful of his holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>The oath which he swore to Abraham our father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>To grant that we, saved from the hands of our enemies, may serve him Without fear</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High. You will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>To give the knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Through the tender compassion of our God, With which the sunrise from on high will shine upon us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, To guide our feet into the path of peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilds until the day of his appearance before Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
