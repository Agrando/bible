Gut it down. Why should we waste land for it?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he answered him, 'Leave it this year too, Sir, until I dig around it and throw on manure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then, if it yields fruit in the future, all right. But if not, then you shall cut it down.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And a woman was there who had had a spirit of weakness eighteen years, and was bent together and could not stand up straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Jesus saw her he called to her and said, "Woman, you have been freed from your weakness,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he laid his hands on her. Immediately she was straightened and gave glory to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the synagogue Director, angry because Jesus was healing on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, "There are six days in which work should be done. On those days come and be healed, but not on the Sabbath day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Master answered him, "Hypocrite, does not each of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger and lead him away and water him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound for eighteen years, to have been freed from this bond on the Sabbath day?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As he said this, all his opposers were ashamed, and all the crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things that he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, "To what is the kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden. It grew and became a tree and the birds of heaven lodged in its branches."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again he said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until the whole was leavened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He was journeying through the cities and villages teaching and making his way toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man said to him, "Master, are there few that are saved?" He said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Try hard to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After the house-holder has arisen and has shut the door, then you will begin to stand outside and knock at the door, and say, 'Master, open to us.' And he will answer you, 'I do not know you or where you come from.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then you will begin and say, 'We have eaten and drunk before you and you have taught in our streets.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he will say to you, 'I do not know where you come from. Go away from me, all you workers of wickedness.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and yourselves thrust outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>People will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south and recline at the table in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Indeed, there are last who will be first and there are first who will be last."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At that time there came to him some Pharisees, saying, "Go out and leave this place, for Herod purposes to kill you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He said to them, "Go tell that fox, 'See, I am casting out demons and performing cures to-day and to-morrow, and on the third day I will finish.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But I must journey to-day, and to-morrow and the next day, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children as a bird gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>See, your house is left to you! I tell you, you will not see me until the day when you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!' "</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
