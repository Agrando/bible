He was highly valued by his master,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>who hearing about Jesus sent to him some elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When they came to Jesus they begged him earnestly, saying, "He deserves to have this done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for he loves our nation and he built us our synagogue."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the Centurion sent friends to say to him, "Do not trouble yourself, Sir, for I am not fit to have you come under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On that account I did not think myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and have my servant cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I am a man \'97 under authority \'97 with soldiers under me, and I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to that one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Jesus heard this, he wondered, and, turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, "I tell you, in Israel I have not found such faith."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It happened soon afterwards that he went to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd were going along with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As he approached the gate of the city, they were carrying out a dead man, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A great crowd from the city was with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the Master saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he went up and touched the bier. The bearers stopped. He said, "Young man, I say, arise!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>All were awe-struck, and they gave praise to God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us and God has visited his people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The reports about him spread through all Judaea and all the region of the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>John's disciples told him about all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he called to him two of his disciples and sent them to the Master to ask, "Are you 'the Coming One' or are we to expect some other person?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they came to him, the men said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, Are you 'the Coming One' or are we to expect some other person?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At that very time he was curing many of diseases and pains and wicked spirits, and to many blind people he was giving sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He answered them, "Go and relate to John what you have seen and heard. Blind men see, lame men walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf men hear, dead men are raised, poor men hear good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Blessed is he who does not stumble through misunderstanding me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After John's messengers had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wild country to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? Indeed, the people in splendid clothing and living in luxury are in kings' palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this is he about whom it was written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will make ready your way before you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I tell you there is not among those born of women a greater than John. But an inferior in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(All the people, even the tax collectors when they heard him, had confessed that God was right by being baptized with the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Pharisees and the lawyers had thwarted the purpose of God in reference to themselves by not being baptized by him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? What are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to one another, 'We played the flute for you but you did not dance. We mourned but you did not wail!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Baptist has come, not eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'See there a man who is a glutton and wine-drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yet Wisdom is shown to be in the right by all her children."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>One of the Pharisees kept asking him to dine with him. Entering the house of this Pharisee, he reclined at the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now there was a certain woman in the city, a sinner, and when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and took her place behind, beside his feet, weeping. Her tears began to rain down on his feet, and with the hair of her head she wiped them off, and she passionately kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said within himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what this woman who is touching him is, for she is a sinner."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus, answering his thought, said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." "Teacher," he said, "say it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"A certain money-lender had two debtors; one owed him five hundred shillings; the other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Because they had nothing to pay with, he graciously forgave both. Which of them will love him most?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered, "I suppose the one to whom he forgave most." He said to him, "You have answered correctly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet. But she has rained tears upon my feet and has wiped them with her hair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You gave me no kiss, but she, since I came in, has not ceased passionately kissing my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>My head with oil you did not anoint, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For this reason I tell you her sins, many as they are, have been forgiven, for she loved much. For he to whom little is forgiven loves little."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He said to her, "Your sins have been forgiven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The other guests began to say to themselves, "Who is this that even forgives sins?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
