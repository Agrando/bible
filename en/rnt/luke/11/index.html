When he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, "Master, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He said to them, "When you pray say: Father, thy name be kept holy; Thy kingdom come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Our bread for the coming day Give us day by day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And forgive us our sins; For we ourselves forgive every one who fails toward us. And bring us not into trial."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend and goes to him at midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for a friend of mine has come to my house after a journey and I have nothing to set before him';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he from within answers, 'Do not trouble me; the door is locked, and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I tell you, even if he will not rise and give them to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him all that he needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I tell you, ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For every one who asks obtains, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks the door will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What father is there among you who if his son asks for bread will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If then you, evil though you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Heavenly Father give a holy spirit to those who ask him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He was casting out a demon and it was dumb. After the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke and the crowds wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some of them said, "By Beelzebul, the chief of the demons, he casts out the demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Others, by way of test, demanded of him a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he, knowing their reasonings, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and a house divided against itself falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? You say that I am casting out demons by Beelzebul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but if I am casting out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore let them be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I am casting out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has already reached you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"When a strong man fully armed guards his castle, his possessions are in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when a stronger than he comes upon him and conquers him, he takes all the armor in which he trusted and divides the spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me is scattering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"When the impure spirit comes out from a man, he goes through waterless places, seeking rest. Not finding it, he says, 'I will return to my house from which I came out.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he goes and takes along seven spirits worse than himself, and they enter and settle down there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>While he was saying this a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said, "Blessed was the womb that carried you and the breasts that you sucked!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said, "Blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As the crowds were thronging about him, he began and said, "This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites so the Son of Man will be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the South will rise in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and more than a Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it. For they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and indeed more than a Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"No one lights a lamp and places it in a cellar or under the peck-measure, but on the stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of the body is the eye. When your eye is clear the whole body is lighted. But when it is bad, your body is dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Make sure that the light that is in you is not darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If your body is all lighted up, not having any part dark, it will be all lighted as when the lamp lights you by its brilliance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>During his talk a Pharisee kept asking him to dine with him. He went in and reclined at table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The Pharisee, seeing this, wondered that he had not first washed before dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The Master said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter, but the inside of you is full of rapacity and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You foolish men, did not he who made the outside make the inside too?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But give the things inside as gifts of mercy and at once all will be clean for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But alas for you, Pharisees! Because you tithe mint, and rue, and every herb, and pass by justice and the love of God. These things you ought to have practiced, without omitting the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Alas for you, Pharisees! for you love the first seats in the synagogues and greetings in the market-places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Alas for you! for you are like unmarked graves. The men who walk over them do not know it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying this you treat us roughly too."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said, "Alas for you lawyers also! for you burden men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Alas for you! for you build the tombs of the prophets, but your fathers killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So you are witnesses and consent to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them and you build their tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So the blood of all the prophets which has been shed from the foundation of the world will be required of this generation \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah who perished between the altar and the House. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Alas for you lawyers! because you have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves have not entered and you have prevented those who were entering."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>After he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon him angrily and cross-question him on many points,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>laying traps to catch something from his mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
