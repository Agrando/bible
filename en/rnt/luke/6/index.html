There was a man there whose right hand was withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The scribes and Pharisees watched to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, wishing to find something to accuse him of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise, and stand in the center." He rose and stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He looked around at all of them, then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they were filled with blind fury, and discussed with one another what they could do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It happened during those days that he went out to the mountain and prayed and was all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When day came, he called to him his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom also he named "Apostles":</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom he named Peter , and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He went down with them and stood on a level spot where were gathered a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be cured of their diseases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Those who were troubled by impure spirits were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The whole crowd tried to touch him, because power went out from him and healed all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He raised his eyes to his disciples and said: "Blessed are you poor! For yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Blessed are you who are hungry now! For you will be abundantly fed. "Blessed are you who are weeping now! For you will laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Blessed are you when men hate you and when they shut you out and reproach you and cast out your name as evil because of the Son of Man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice on that day and leap for joy. For, indeed, your reward will be great in heaven. Just so their fathers treated the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"But alas for you rich men! For you have now your comfort in full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Alas for you who are filled now! For you will hunger. "Alas for you who are laughing now! For you will mourn and wail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Alas for you, when all men speak well of you! Just so their fathers treated the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I tell you, my hearers, love your enemies; act nobly to those who hate you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those who curse you; pray for those who insult you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who strikes you on one cheek, offer also the other. To him who takes your cloak, do not refuse your tunic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>To every one who asks, give, and from him who takes your things, do not ask them back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do to men just as you wish them to do to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If you love those who love you, what grace have you? For sinners also love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If you do good to those who do good to you, what grace have you? Sinners also do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what grace have you? Sinners also lend to sinners in order to get back as much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies and do good and lend without hope of return, and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the Most High. For he is generous to the ungrateful and wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Become compassionate as your Father is compassionate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed in, shaken down, and running over they will pour into your lap. For with the measure that you measure with will the return to you be measured."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He gave them an illustration: "The blind cannot lead the blind, can he? Will not both fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A scholar is not superior to his teacher. Every scholar when finished will be like his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye while you do not perceive the beam in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me get out the speck that is in your eye,' while you yourself never notice the beam in your own eye? Hypocrite, take out first the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to get out the speck in your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"There is no good tree that yields worthless fruit, nor is there a worthless tree that yields fine fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Every tree will be known by its own fruit. They do not gather figs from thorns, nor from a bramble-bush do they harvest grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man from the good treasury of his heart brings forth what is good, and the evil man from his evil treasury brings forth what is evil. Out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"Why do you call me: 'Master, Master,' and yet not do what I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you whom he is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood came, the river dashed against that house, and could not shake it, because it had been well built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who hears and does not do is like a man building a house on the earth without foundation, against which the river dashed, and at once it fell, and the wreck of that house was great."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
