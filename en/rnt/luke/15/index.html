So he divided his wealth between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Not many days later, the younger son got everything together and went away to a far country and there squandered his property in a dissolute life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he had spent everything, there came a terrible famine in that land and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he would fain have filled his stomach with the pods the swine were eating, but no one gave him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then, coming to himself, he said, 'How many hired men of my father have bread more than enough, and here I am perishing with famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise and go to my father and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired men.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and pitied him, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him tenderly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son' \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this, my son, was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.' And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now his older son was in the field, and when on returning he drew near the house he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Calling to him one of the servants, he inquired what this was. The servant said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>'Your brother has come and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back in health.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he grew angry, and would not go in. Then his father came out and begged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he answered his father, 'See, all these years I have been serving you, and I never broke a command of yours, yet you have never given me a kid to make merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when this son of yours, who has wasted your property with bad women, came, you have killed for him the fattened calf.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the father said to him, 'Child, you are always with me and all that I have is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We could not but make merry and rejoice, for your brother here was dead and has come to life; he was lost and is found.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
