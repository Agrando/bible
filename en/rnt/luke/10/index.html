Pray, therefore, to the Owner of the harvest to hurry out laborers into his harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Go; I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Carry no purse, no bag, no shoes, and salute no one by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon it; but if not, it will return upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the same house remain, eating and drinking what they have, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not change about from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whatever city you enter, if they welcome you, eat what is set before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Heal those in it that are sick and tell them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whatever city you enter and they do not welcome you, go out into the streets of it and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'Even the dust of your city that clings to our feet we wipe off for you; but know this, that the kingdom of God is near.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be abased to Hades!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me. He who rejects me rejects him who sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The seventy returned with joy saying, "Master, even the demons are subject to us in your name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to them, "I was looking when Satan fell like lightning from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>See, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>However, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At that hour in exultant joy through the Holy Sprit he said, "I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and hast revealed them to babes. Yea, Father, I thank thee that such became thy good pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"All things have been committed to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, or who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son may will to reveal him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Turning to his disciples, he said privately, "Blessed are your eyes that see what you see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I tell you, many prophets and kings wished to see the things that you see and did not see them, and to hear the things that you hear and did not hear them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then a certain lawyer stood up to test him, and said, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit life eternal?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered, " 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you will live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus rejoined, "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and went away leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By chance a certain priest was going down that road. When he saw him, he went by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In the same way a Levite came to the place and saw him, and passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain Samaritan as he traveled came near him, and saw him and pitied him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine. Then placing him on his own beast he took him to the inn and cared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next morning he took out two shillings and gave them to the inn-keeper and said, 'Care for him, and what evermore you spend, I will pay in full when I come back.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Which of these three seems to you to have become neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He said, "He who did kindness to him." Jesus said to him, "Go and act in the same way yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As they journeyed, he entered a certain village. There a woman named Martha welcomed him to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>She had a sister called Mary who seated herself at the feet of the Master and was listening to his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was busy and worried over a great deal of service. Coming to him she said, "Master, do you not care that my sister has left me to do the work alone? Tell her to take hold with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But the Master answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but there is need only of a few, or one. Mary has chosen the good part and it shall not be taken from her."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
