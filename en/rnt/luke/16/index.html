Give an account of your management; for you cannot longer be manager.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do? for my master is going to take the management away from me. I have not strength to dig; I am ashamed to beg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what I will do, so that when I am dismissed from the management they may welcome me into their houses.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So, calling to him all of the debtors of his master, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my master?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He replied, 'A hundred measures of oil.' He said, 'Take your account and sit down quickly and write fifty.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then to another he said, 'And you, how much do you owe?' He replied, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your account and write eighty.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The master praised the wicked manager because he had done prudently. For the sons of this world are with reference to their own generation wiser than the sons of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I tell you, make for yourselves friends with the Mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails they may welcome you into the eternal tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in much, and he who is dishonest in the least is also dishonest in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If, then, you have not been faithful in the dishonest Mammon, who will entrust to you the true?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if you were not faithful in what was another's, who will give you what is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No house servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all this and they were sneering at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"The Law and the Prophets were until John. From that time the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed and every one is forcing his way into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Every one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"A certain man was rich and was clothed in purple and fine linen and lived merrily every day in splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And a certain poor man by the name of Lazarus had been laid at his gate, full of sores</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and longing to be fed from what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It happened that the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He called and said, 'Father Abraham, have compassion on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you had your good things in full in your lifetime, and Lazarus likewise had his evil things. Now he is here receiving comfort and you are in anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who wish to cross from here to you cannot, nor can any cross from there to us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he said, 'I beg you, then, Father, to send him to my father's house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I have five brothers, in order to testify to them, so that they may not come also to this place of torment.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will have a change of heart.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Abraham replied, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rises from the dead.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
