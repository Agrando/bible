Follow him into the house that he enters</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the dining room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will show you an upper room, large and furnished. There make ready."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They went away and found everything just as he had said, and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the hour came, he reclined at table and the apostles with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, "I have strongly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, I tell you, I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He took a cup and gave thanks and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, I say to you, I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he took a loaf and gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He took the cup in the same manner after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, see, the hand of the traitor is with me on the table!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Son of Man is going, as it is appointed, but alas for that man by whom he is betrayed!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They began to question among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There was also a dispute among them as to which of them should be regarded as superior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those of them who exercise authority are called benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you are not to be so. The greatest among you is to be like the youngest and the leader like him who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For which is superior, he who reclines at table or he who serves? Is not he who reclines? But I am in the midst of you as the one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You are those who have stood by me in my trials</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I will assign to you, as my Father has assigned to me, a kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Simon, Simon, Satan has begged to be allowed to sift all of you like wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for thee that thy faith may not fail. And when you come back to yourself, strengthen your brothers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter said to him, "Master, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said, "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow to-day before you three times deny that you know me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse or bag or shoes, did you lack for anything?" They said, "We lacked for nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said to them, "But now whoever has a purse must take it, and so with a bag, and he who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I tell you that the prophecy must be fulfilled in me \'97 the prophecy, 'He was numbered among the lawless.' For what concerns me is coming to an end."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They said, "Master, here are two swords." He said to them, "That is enough."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He went out and made his way, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he came to the place, he said to them, "Pray not to enter into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He parted from them about a stone's throw and kneeled down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"Father, if thou wilt, take away this cup from me. Yet not my will, but thine, be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>An angel from heaven appeared to him strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood failing upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he rose from prayer and came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he was still speaking there came a crowd, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came up to Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to him, "Judas, is it with a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Those about Jesus, seeing what was going to happen, said, "Master, shall we strike with the sword?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>One of them did strike the High Priest's servant and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus said, "Let me at least do this," and he touched his ear and healed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus said to the high priests and officers of the Temple and elders who had come out against him, "You come out with swords and clubs, just as if after a robber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>In the daytime while I was with you in the Temple courts you did not stretch out your hands to take me. But this is your hour and the power of darkness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>After arresting him they led him away and brought him into the house of the High Priest. Peter followed at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>They lighted a fire in the center of the court and seated themselves around it, and Peter seated himself in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>A maid saw him sitting near the light, and, looking hard at him, said, "This man was with him too."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>After a short space another \'97 a man \'97 saw him, and said, "You too are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>About an hour later, another man asserted positively, "Truly this man was with him too, for he is a Galilaean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." Immediately while he was speaking the cock crew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and the Master turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Master, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows to-day you will disown me three times."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he went out and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The men who had arrested Jesus made sport of him, beating him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and, after blindfolding him, they asked him, "Prophesy who it is that struck you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Many other insulting words they said to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>When daylight came, the eldership of the people assembled, both high priests and scribes, and they led him to their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>"If you are the Christ, tell us." He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>If I question you, you will not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But from this time the Son of Man will be seated at the powerful right hand of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>They all said, "You then are the Son of God?" He said to them, "I am what you say."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>They said, "Why do we need any more testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
