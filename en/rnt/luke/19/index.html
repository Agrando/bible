Did you know that I was an austere man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping where I did not sow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then why did you not put my silver into the bank, so that when I came I could have exacted it with interest?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then to those who stood by he said, 'Take from him the silver and give it to him who has tenfold.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said to him, 'Sir, he has tenfold.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>'I tell you,' he said, 'that to every one who has, shall be given, and from him who has not, even what he has shall be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But those enemies of mine, who did not want me to be king over them, bring here and slaughter them before me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he had said these things, he journeyed onward, going up toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they approached Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called the Olive Orchard, he sent two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>telling them, "Go into the village across there, and as you enter it you will find a colt tied upon which no man has ever sat.

Peace in heaven and glory in the heights above!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But he said, "I tell you if these become silent, the stones will cry out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>As he drew near and looked at the city, he wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, "If this day you also knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For days will come when your enemies will throw up a palisade against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and level you to the ground, and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time when you were visited."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Entering into the Temple courts he began and drove out the dealers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He was teaching every day in the Temple courts. But the high priests and the scribes were bent on destroying him, and so were the first citizens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But they could find no way to do it; for all the people hung upon him listening.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
