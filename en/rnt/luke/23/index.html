Jesus answered him, "I am."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate said to the high priests and the crowd, "I find nothing criminal in this man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they were violent in saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching through the whole of Judaea. Starting in Galilee, he is now here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pilate, on hearing of Galilee, asked if the man was a Galilaean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and when he learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem during those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Herod on seeing Jesus was much pleased because for a long time he had been anxious to see him on account of hearing about him, and he was hoping to see some miracle done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He questioned him with many words; but Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The high priests and the scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Herod along with his soldiers treated him with contempt and after making sport of him and putting a gorgeous robe on him, sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that day. Previously they had been at enmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate called together the high priests and the rulers and the people</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and said to them, "You have brought before me this man as one who misguides the people, and yet I, in examining him before you, have found in this man not one criminal thing of all that you charge against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No more has Herod; for he has sent him back to us. See, nothing deserving of death has been done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So I will scourge him and release him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the whole crowd cried out together, "Put him out of the way and free Barabbas for us!"</span> <span class="verse note empty"><a name="19">19</a>Barabbas, on account of a riot that had occurred in the city and for murder, had been thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again Pilate spoke to them, wishing to release Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the third time he said to them, "What wrong has he done? I have found nothing criminal in him. I will therefore scourge him and let him go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they insisted with loud voices asking to have him crucified, and their voices prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Pilate gave sentence that what they asked should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He freed the man who for riot and murder had been thrown into prison \'97 the man they asked for; but Jesus he handed over to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As they led him away, they took hold of Simon, a Cyrenian coming from the country, and laid on him the cross to bear behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There followed him a great crowd of people and of women who were beating their breasts and bewailing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed a babe!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they will begin and say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Hide us!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There were also two others, criminals, led with him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified him and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." They divided his clothes by casting lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The people stood looking on. The rulers scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The soldiers made sport of him, coming up and offering him sour wine</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There was a writing over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>One of the criminals who were crucified insulted him, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other rebuked him and said, "Have you no fear of God, since you are under the same sentence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we are here justly, for we are receiving our due for our deeds. But this man has done nothing wrong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus said to him, "I tell you truly to-day you will be with me in Paradise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It was now about noon, and darkness came over all the land until three,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>the sun being eclipsed. And the curtain in the Temple was torn in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Jesus said in a loud voice, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit." After saying this, he breathed his last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When the Centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, "Certainly this was an upright man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the crowds that had stood by looking on the scene, after seeing what happened, turned away beating their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>All his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee were standing at a distance looking on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>There was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>who had not participated in their plan and action. He was of Arimathaea, a city of the Judaeans, and was looking for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He took it down and wrapped it in fine linen and laid him in a tomb cut in the rock where no one was yet lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>It was the day of Preparation and the Sabbath was about to begin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed along and saw the tomb and how his body was laid,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and they went back and prepared perfumes and ointments. On the Sabbath they abstained from work according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
