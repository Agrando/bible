They were much afraid,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but the angel said to them, "Have no fear! Indeed, I am bringing you good news of a great joy which is to be for all the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for there was born for you to-day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ and Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This will be a sign for you: you will find the babe wrapped up and lying in a manger."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude from the army of heaven, praising God, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Glory in highest heaven to God, and peace on earth among men in whom he delights."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When the angels went away into heaven, the shepherds spoke to one another: "Let us go to Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw it, they told what had been spoken to them about this child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All who heard it wondered at what was said to them by the shepherds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When eight days had passed and the time to circumcise him had come, his name was called Jesus \'97 the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the days of their purification were completed, according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male shall be called holy to the Lord,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to give an offering according to what is said in the law of the Lord, "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There was in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, and this man was upright and God-fearing, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he was not to see death before he saw the Lord's Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Led by the Spirit he came into the Temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus in order to do for him according to the custom of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he took him into his arms and blessed God, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Now, O Lord, thou art letting thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a light for revelation to Gentiles and a glory to thy people Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>His father and his mother wondered at the things that were spoken about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, "This child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel and for a sign much spoken against</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>in order that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.

She never left the Temple courts, but worshiped by fastings and prayers, night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>She too came up at that time and praised God and spoke about him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When they had completed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The child grew and became strong and was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>His parents used to go up every year to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When he had reached the age of twelve years, and they had gone up according to the custom of the feast</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and had completed the days and were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But his parents did not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thinking that he was in the company, they went a day's journey. But when they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>On the third day they found him in the Temple courts, sitting in the midst of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When his parents saw him, they were amazed, and his mother said to him, "Child, why have you treated us so? See, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He said to them, "Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be at my Father's?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>They did not understand the words that he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then he went down with them, and came to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus grew in wisdom and in height and in favor with God and with men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
