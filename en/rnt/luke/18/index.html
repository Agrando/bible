Later he said to himself, 'Even though I do not fear God nor regard man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>yet because this widow is annoying me I will do her justice so that she may not keep coming and mauling me forever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Master said, "Hear what the wicked judge says;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and will not God do justice for his elect, who are calling to him day and night, even though he is long-suffering with their adversaries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I tell you, he will do justice for them speedily. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He gave also this illustration to some who trusted in themselves as being righteous and despised others:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Two men went up to the Temple courts to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, 'God, I thank thee that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners, cheats, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all I get.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the tax collector stood far off and would not even lift his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God be merciful to me, the sinner!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For every one who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They were bringing to him babes for him to touch. The disciples on seeing this rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called the children to him, saying, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly, I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will not enter it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>One of the rulers asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit life eternal?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except one \'97 God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You know the commandments: Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not commit murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honor thy father and thy mother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said, "All these I have kept from my boyhood up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On hearing that, Jesus said to him, "You lack still one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and then come and follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he, on hearing this, became deeply sorrowful, for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus looked at him and said, "With how much difficulty do those who have riches enter the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter said, "See, we have left our property and have followed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said to them, "I tell you truly there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will not receive many times more in this world, and in the world to come life eternal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Taking the twelve aside, he said to them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written through the prophets will be fully done to the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and he will be made sport of and insulted and spit upon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and they will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they understood none of these things, and what he said was hidden from them. They did not grasp the meaning of his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As he approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Hearing a crowd passing, he inquired what this was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They told him, "Jesus, the Nazarene, is passing by."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he shouted, "Jesus, son of David, have pity on me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Those who were in front rebuked him and told him to be still. But he kept crying out much louder, "Son of David, have pity on me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be led to him. When he had come up, Jesus asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Sir, I want my sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to him, "See. Your faith has healed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Immediately he received sight and followed him, giving glory to God. All the people upon seeing this gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
