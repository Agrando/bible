If your brother sins against you, reprove him, and if he changes his mind, forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Even if seven times in the day he sins against you and seven times turns to you, saying, 'I repent,' forgive him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The apostles said to the Master, "Increase our faith."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Master said, "If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come quickly and recline at table'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the contrary, will he not say to him, 'Make ready something for my dinner and gird yourself and wait on me while I eat and drink, and after that you may eat and drink yourself'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Does he thank the servant because he did what he was told?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Just so you, when you have done all that has been commanded you, say, 'We are useless servants; we have done merely what we ought to have done.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It happened that on his journey toward Jerusalem he was going through Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As he was approaching a certain village, ten leprous men met him. They stood at a distance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and, raising their voices, called, "Jesus, Master, have compassion on us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus saw them, he said, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." While they were going, they became clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>One of them, seeing that he had been cured, turned back with a loud shout giving glory to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he fell on his face at the feet of Jesus, thanking him. He was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said, "Were not ten cleansed? But the nine \'97 where are they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was there none found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said to him, "Rise and go. Your faith has healed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, Jesus answered them, "The kingdom of God will not come in a way that can be observed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor will they say, 'Here it is!' or, 'There it is!' For indeed the kingdom of God is among you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He said to the disciples, "There will come days when you will wish to see one of the days of the Son of Man and you will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They will say to you, 'See here!' or, 'See there!' but do not start off or go in pursuit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightning when it flashes shines from one part of the heavens to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day that Noah went into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Just so it was in the days of Lot; they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So will the Son of Man be on the day that he is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On that day, if a man is on the housetop and his things in the house, he must not come down to get them, and for the same reason if he is in the field he must not turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses it will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you that night there will be two men in one bed; one will be taken with him and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There will be two women grinding at the same mill, one will be taken with him and the other will be left."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said to him, "Where, Master?"
