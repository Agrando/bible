But the grape-growers beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He afterwards sent another servant. That one, too, they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he sent a third. But this one, too, they wounded and threw out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The owner of the vineyard said, 'I will send my son, my beloved. Perhaps they will reverence him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the grape-growers saw him, they conferred with one another and said, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they threw him outside of the vineyard and killed him. What now will the owner of the vineyard do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy those grape-growers and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, they exclaimed, "May it never be!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He turned his eyes upon them and said, "What does this Scripture mean, 'The stone which the builders rejected \'97 that one has become the corner stone'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one who falls upon that stone will be shattered, but whomever it falls on it will crush to pieces."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The scribes and the high priests were eager to lay hands on him at that very time, for they knew that he had aimed the illustration at them; but they were afraid of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So watching insidiously for an opportunity they sent spies, who pretended to be honest men, to seize upon anything he might say, so as to hand him over to the authorities and to the power of the Governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They asked him, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly and that you do not regard personal influences, but you teach the way of God according to truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it right for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He saw through their cunning and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Show me a coin. Whose head and inscription does it have on it?" They said, "Caesar's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said to them, "Then pay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and pay to God what belongs to God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They could not seize upon his words before the people, and in astonishment at his answer they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There came to him some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If any one's married brother dies childless, that man must marry his brother's widow and raise up offspring for his brother.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Well, there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The second</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the third and the rest of the seven took her and died leaving no children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Finally the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now this woman \'97 whose wife will she be at the resurrection? For she was wife to the seven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, "The children of this world marry and are married,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but those who are judged worthy to reach that world and the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are married,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>neither can they die, for they are like angels and are children of God, since they are children of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But that the dead rise Moses has made known in the passage regarding the Bush where he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He is not a God of dead men, but of living men. For all are alive to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Some of the scribes answered him, "Teacher, you have spoken well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they no longer dared to ask him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He said to them, "How do they say that the Christ is the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>until I make your enemies your footstool.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So David calls him 'Lord'; how is he then his son?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>While all the people were listening, he said to the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes and love salutations in the market-places and front seats in the synagogues and the best couches at dinners,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour widows' houses and in pretense make long prayers. These will receive unusual condemnation."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
