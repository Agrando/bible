He is the head of every archangel and authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In him you were circumcised with a circumcision not done by hands, by laying aside your fleshly body in the circumcision of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You were buried with him in baptism and raised again through faith in the inworking of God who raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You who were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh God has made alive with him, and has forgiven us all our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He erased the writing that was against us in the rules, the writing that was opposed to us. He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He despoiled the archangels and authorities and fearlessly made an example of them when he triumphed over them on the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let no one then judge you in the matter of food or drink or in regard to a festival or new moon or Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These were a shadow of coming things, but the body is Christ's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one as umpire defraud you of your prize, if he delights in excessive humility and ceremonial worship of the angels, searching into his own visions, emptily puffed up by his fleshly mind</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and not holding to the Head, from whom the whole body, supplied and held together by joints and bands, grows as God gives it growth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If you died with Christ to the elementary teachings of the world, why do you, as if still living in the world, have such rules as,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Do not touch," "Do not taste," "Do not handle"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>referring to things that perish when used?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These rules follow the commandments and teachings of men.
