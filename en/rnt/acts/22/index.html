He continued:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel in exact knowledge of our ancestral Law, and I was zealous for God as you all are to-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>as the High Priest and all the eldership can testify for me. From them I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus in order to bring back in chains to Jerusalem for punishment those who had gone there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It happened that as I was journeying and nearing Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light flashed from heaven around me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I asked, 'Who is speaking?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My companions saw the light, but did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Rise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that it has been appointed for you to do.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Since I could not see, owing to the brightness of that light, my companions led me by the hand, and so I entered Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Then a man named Ananias, a strict observer of the Law and highly esteemed by all the Jews who lived there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>came to see me and stood by me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight,' and I, at that moment, could see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for you shall be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now why delay? Rise, be baptized and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"After I had returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the Temple courts, I fell into a trance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and saw Jesus saying to me, 'Hasten and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I said, 'Lord, they know that I used to imprison and beat from synagogue to synagogue those who believe in thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed I myself was standing by and approving it, and taking care of the cloaks of those who were putting him to death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to Gentiles.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They listened up to this point, but now they broke out, shouting, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought never to have lived!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>While they were shouting and rending their garments and throwing dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the Tribune ordered him to be led into the barracks and directed that he should be examined with the lash, so that he might know for what crime they were shouting so against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the Centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and without a trial?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On hearing that, the Centurion went to the Tribune and told him," What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the Tribune came to him and said, "Tell me; are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The Tribune said, "I obtained this citizenship by paying a great sum of money." Paul said, "But I was born to it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At once those who were about to examine him went away from him, and the Tribune was alarmed when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had chained him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>On the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, the Tribune loosed Paul and ordered the high priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and stood him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
