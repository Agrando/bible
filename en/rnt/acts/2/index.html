Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>All who believed had all things together in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They would sell their lands and goods and distribute to all as any one had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Every day, continuing with one accord in the Temple courts and in breaking bread from house to house, they ate together in joy and simplicity of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God and having favor with all the people. The Lord added daily to their number those who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
