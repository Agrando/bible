He went to the High Priest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and asked from him letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that if he should find any persons who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>On his journey he was getting near to Damascus when suddenly a light from heaven flashed round him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He asked, "Who is speaking?" The answer was, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But stand up and go into the city and it will be told you what you must do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The men who were on the road with him stood struck dumb, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Saul rose from the earth and opened his eyes, but he could see nothing. Taking him by the hand they led him into Damascus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There was in Damascus a certain disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." He answered, "Here I am, Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called Straight street, and ask in the house of Judas for a man named Saul from Tarsus. He is now in prayer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him in order that he may receive his sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard about this man from many people \'97 how many wicked things he has done to thy holy ones in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and here he has authority from the high priests to bind all who call upon thy name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord said to him, "Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before nations and kings and the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ananias went and entered the house and put his hands on Saul, and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me \'97 Jesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming \'97 that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Immediately scales seemed to fall from his eyes and he could see, and he arose and was baptized,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and after taking food he regained his strength. Saul passed some days with the disciples who were in Damascus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and at once he began to proclaim in the synagogues that Jesus was the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All who heard him were astonished and said, "Is not this the man who in Jerusalem persecuted those who call on this name, and who came here for the very purpose of binding and taking them to the high priests?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul grew stronger and put to confusion the Jews who lived at Damascus, as he proved that this man was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When a number of days had passed, the Jews plotted to put him out of the way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but this became known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night to seize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Saul reached Jerusalem, he tried to attach himself to the disciples, but all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in Damascus in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After that Saul was with them in Jerusalem, going out and in</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and speaking freely in the name of the Lord. He frequently spoke and debated with the Greek-speaking Jews. But they kept trying to put him out of the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When the brethren learned of it, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the church had peace throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and was built up, and advancing in the reverence of the Lord and by the encouragement of the Holy Spirit grew continually in numbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It happened that Peter, while passing about among all the holy, came down also to those who were dwelling at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He found there a man named Aeneas who had been for eight years lying on a pallet, for he was a paralytic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing you. Rise up and make your bed." Immediately he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>All who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha . She abounded in good works and acts of kindness which she was accustomed to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>It happened at that time that she fell sick and died. They bathed her and laid her out in an upper room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Since Lydda was near to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him begging him, "Do not delay to come on down to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Peter arose and went along with them. On his arrival they took him up to the room. All of the widows came around him wailing and showing the tunics and cloaks that Dorcas had made while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Peter sent them all out and kneeling down he prayed. Then turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, rise." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Giving her his hand he raised her to her feet. Then calling the holy and the widows he presented her to them alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>This became known through all Joppa and many believed in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Peter stayed in Joppa many days with a man named Simon, a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
