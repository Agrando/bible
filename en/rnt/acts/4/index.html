For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Observing the fearless outspokenness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were common, uneducated men, they were astonished, and they recognized them as former companions of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seeing the man who had been healed standing there with the apostles, they had nothing to say in opposition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After ordering them to go out of the council, they conferred together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, "What shall we do to these men? For that a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But that it may not spread further among the people, let us sternly forbid them to speak any longer in this name to any one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So, calling them in, they commanded them absolutely not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We, for our part, cannot refrain from saying what we have seen and heard."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Council after further threats set them at liberty, not finding any way to punish them on account of the people; for all were giving glory to God because of what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man upon whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The apostles upon being released came to their friends and told them all that the high priests and the elders had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They hearing it unitedly lifted up their prayer to God and said, "O Lord, thou who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who through the Holy Spirit by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, didst say, 'Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers are gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ' \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for truly in this city Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered against thy holy servant Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do all that thy hands and thy will had predetermined should take place \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>now, Lord, look upon their threats and enable thy servants to speak thy message with all fearlessness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>while thou dost stretch out thine hand for healing and while signs and wonders are done through the name of thy holy servant Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>After this prayer the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the message of God with courageous freedom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The multitude of those who had believed was of one heart and one soul, and no one said that any part of his property was his own, but they had all things in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>With great power the apostles continued to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nor was any one in need among them, for all who were owners of lands or houses would sell them and bring the money for what had been sold</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and lay it at the apostles' feet, and it would be distributed to each as he had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Joseph, to whom the apostles had given the name Barnabas, which means "Son of Encouragement," a Levite born in Cyprus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>being the owner of a farm, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
