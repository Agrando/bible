He had been lame from his mother's womb and never had walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He was listening to Paul as he was speaking. Paul fixed his eyes on him, and, seeing that he had faith to be healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>said in a loud voice, "Stand up straight on your feet." He sprang up and walked about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, "The gods have taken human form and come down to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They called Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the principal speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, followed by the crowds, and intended to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they rent their garments and sprang into the crowd, crying out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Men, why are you doing this? We too are men with the same weaknesses that you have. We are bringing you the good news that you are to turn from these foolish things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In past generations he permitted all the nations to go their own ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>though he did not leave himself without evidence, for he did you good and gave rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even by saying this they with difficulty kept the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds, and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside of the city, thinking that he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when the disciples gathered around him he rose up and reentered the city. On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Telling the good news in that city they made a number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>reassuring the minds of the disciples and encouraging them to be steadfast in the faith, saying, "Through many trials we must enter into the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They appointed elders for them in every church, and after prayer and fasting committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After telling the message in Perga, they came down to Attalia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>From there they sailed for Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Upon their arrival they assembled the church and narrated all that God, working with them, had done, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There they passed no little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
