Paul visited these people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and because he was of the same trade stayed with them and they worked together; for by trade they were tent-makers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But in the synagogue every Sabbath he reasoned and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was absorbed by the message, bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they resisted and spoke profane words, he rent his garments and said to them, "Your blood is on your own heads. I am clear, and from now on I am going to the Gentiles."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he changed over from there and came into the house of a man named Titus Justus, who reverenced God. His house was next to the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Crispus, the synagogue Director, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord spoke in the night by a vision to Paul, "Do not fear, but speak and be not silent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for I am with you and no one shall attack and harm you, for I have many people in this city."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he stayed a year and six months, teaching among them the message of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While Gallio was Proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one mind made an attack on Paul and brought him before the court,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, "This man is inducing men to worship God in a way contrary to law."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it was some crime or wicked knavery, O you Jews, I would have reasonable patience with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if it is a dispute about doctrine and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he drove them from before the judge's seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid hold of Sosthenes, the synagogue Director, and beat him right in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio cared for none of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Paul remained a number of days more. Then after taking leave of the brethren he sailed away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila went with him. He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came to Ephesus and Paul left his companions there. He himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Although they begged him to stay longer, he did not consent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but took his leave, saying, "I will return to you again, God willing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From Ephesus he put to sea and came to Caesarea. Then he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, and from there returned to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After spending some time there he set out and went through the Galatian country and Phrygia, place by place, strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, a learned man, had come to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was strong in knowledge of the Scriptures and had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and, being very earnest in spirit, was teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew no baptism but John's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This man began to speak fearlessly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As he wished to cross over to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. So he went and greatly helped those who had believed through grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he powerfully and publicly refuted the Jews, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
