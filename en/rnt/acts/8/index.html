On that day arose a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem. All except the apostles were scattered through Judaea and Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Pious men carried Stephen away for burial and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Saul cruelly hounded the church from house to house, entering and dragging out men and women and handing them over into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those who were scattered went to various places telling the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The crowds with one mind gave attention to what was said by Philip, listening to his words and seeing the signs that he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For impure spirits came out shrieking from many who had been possessed, and many paralytic and lame people were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There was great rejoicing in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A certain man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They had all given attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the power of God which is called great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They had given attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them by his magic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip, who was telling the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Simon himself also believed and was baptized and attached himself to Philip, and seeing the signs and great miracles that took place he was astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the message of God, they sent to them Peter and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They on arrival prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Spirit had not yet fallen on any one of them; they had merely been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, "Give to me also this power that whoever I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, "Your money perish with you because you have thought that you could buy the gift of God with money!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have no part or lot in this matter.

Now there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of high rank under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over her treasury. He had been to Jerusalem to worship</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and was on his return, sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said, "How can I without some one to guide me?"

What is there to hinder my being baptized?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He ordered the chariot to stop and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When they had come up out of the water, the Spirit caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more. He went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip found himself at Azotus, and passing through all the cities he told the good news until he came to Casarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
