When a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There were in company with him Sopater of Beraea, the son of Pyrrhus, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy, and from Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These went on and were waiting for us in Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After the Days of Unleavened Bread we sailed from Philippi and came to them in Troas in five days. There we spent seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the first day of the week, when we all were assembled to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, being about to leave in the morning, and he extended his address until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A certain young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, was overcome with deep sleep while Paul went on discoursing. At last overpowered by sleep he fell from the third story and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Paul went down and threw himself on him and embraced him and said, "Do not make a noisy wailing; for his life is still in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he went up and broke bread and ate and talked on till daybreak and so departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They brought the boy living, and were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We went in advance to the ship and sailed for Assos, intending to take on Paul there, for so he had arranged, intending to come himself by land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So when he joined us at Assos, we took him aboard and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From there we sailed next day and arrived off Chios. The next day we came to Samos, and on the following day to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus in order not to spend time in Asia. He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they came to him, he said to them, "You know how I have lived among you the whole time since the first day I set foot in Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>how I did not shrink from telling you anything that was profitable or from teaching you publicly and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>urging upon both Jews and Greeks the need of a change of heart toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"And now I am on my way, bound in spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing what is to befall me there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit testifies from city to city that chains and trials are waiting for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I do not hold my life as of any account if only I may finish my race and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now I know that you all, among whom I have gone about heralding the kingdom, will never see my face again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I testify to you to-day that I am clear of the blood of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I did not shrink from telling you the whole purpose of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Be watchful of yourselves and of all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers. Shepherd the church of God which he bought with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you, not sparing the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And from among yourselves men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watch, remembering that for three years I never ceased night nor day to exhort each one of you with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"And now I commit you to the Lord and to his gracious message, which can build you up and give you the heritage among all those who have been made holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You yourselves know that these hands provided for my needs and the needs of my companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In all things I showed you that so laboring we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>After saying this he kneeled with them all and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All wept aloud, and falling on Paul's neck they kissed him affectionately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>grieving especially because he had said that they would never see his face again; and they escorted him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
