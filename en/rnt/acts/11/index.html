He said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"I was in the city of Joppa and was praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. Something like a great sheet was descending, lowered from heaven by the four corners, and it came to where I was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I looked at it attentively and saw the fourfooted animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I said, 'By no means, Lord, for never has anything common or unclean entered my mouth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The voice spoke again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed you must not think common.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This happened three times and then everything was drawn up again into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Immediately three men came to the house in which we were. They had been sent from Caesarea to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Spirit directed me to go with them without any questioning. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He related to us how he had seen in his house an angel who stood and said, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will speak to you words by which you and your whole household will be saved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When I began speaking the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us at the beginning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and I remembered the words of the Lord how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then God gave to them the same gift that he gave to us on believing in the Lord Jesus, who was I that I could oppose God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On hearing this they ceased their criticism and gave glory to God, saying, "Then even to the Gentiles God has granted the change of heart that leads to life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message to none but Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, and they on reaching Antioch spoke also to the Greeks, telling them the good news of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number believed and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Word came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem regarding these men, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he arrived and saw the grace of God he was delighted, and he encouraged all to be firmly faithful to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. A considerable number were added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Barnabas went away to Tarsus to look up Saul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and upon finding him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large company, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called "Christians."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In those days some prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>One of them named Agabus arose and foretold through the Holy Spirit that a great famine was going to occur over all the inhabited world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the disciples determined, each according to his means, to send something for the help of the brethren who were living in Judaea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
