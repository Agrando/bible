Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"In regard to all of the things of which I am accused by Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am to make my defense to-day before you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>since you are especially expert in all Jewish customs and questions. Therefore I pray you to hear me patiently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"My life from boyhood, which was from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, all Jews know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They knew me from long ago, if they were willing to testify, and that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now I stand to be tried for the hope of the promise which God made to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to which our twelve tribes devotedly serving God night and day hope to attain. For this hope I am accused by the Jews, O King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Why do all of you consider it incredible if God raises dead men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I thought with myself that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I did it in Jerusalem and many holy men I shut up in prison, getting authority from the high priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In all the synagogues and often I punished them and compelled them to say profane words. Being excessively mad against them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Thus engaged, as I was journeying to Damascus with authority and commission from the high priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>about midday, on the road, I saw, O King, a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven around me and my companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I said, 'Who is speaking?' He said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But rise and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you a servant and a witness of the times you have seen me and of the times I shall appear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will deliver you from your people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among those who are made holy by faith in me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but first to the people in Damascus and then to the people of Jerusalem and through all the land of Judaea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds suitable for a change of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"For this reason Jews seized me in the Temple courts and tried to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But obtaining help from God I have continued until this day witnessing to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would be,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Christ would suffer and that he first, by rising from the dead, would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>While Paul was thus defending himself, Festus said loudly, "You are raving, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"I am not insane," he said, "most noble Festus, but am uttering words of truth and soberness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The King knows about this, and to him I speak with perfect frankness, for I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his attention, for this has not been done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Agrippa said to Paul, "With little effort you are persuading me to become a Christian."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Paul said, "I would to God that whether with little or with much, not only you, but all who hear me this day, would become such as I am \'97 except for these chains."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the King rose and the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and after withdrawing they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
