The angel said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts of charity have come up as an evidence before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now send men to Joppa and ask for a man named Simon, who is called Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is the guest of a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the angel who had been speaking to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a pious soldier of those who were attached to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and, after explaining everything to them, sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On the next day, while they were on the road and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray. It was about noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He began to feel hungry and wished to eat. While they were preparing food, he fell into a trance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and saw the heavens opened and something descending like a great sheet being let down to the ground by the four corners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In it were all kinds of fourfooted animals and reptiles and birds of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then a voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unclean or impure."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A second time the voice came to him, "What God has cleansed you must not think unclean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This happened a third time, and then immediately the sheet was taken up into the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Peter was thinking this over and was at a loss what the vision meant. Just then the men who had been sent by Cornelius, after inquiring for the house of Simon, came to the door</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and called to know whether Simon called Peter was a guest there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While Peter was debating with himself about the vision, the Spirit said, "Here are two men looking for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rise and go down and go with them without misgivings, for I have sent them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter went down and said to the men, "Here I am \'97 the man you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to listen to your words."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he invited them in and entertained them. The next day Peter arose and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>On the following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had assembled his relatives and his close friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As Peter was about to enter, Cornelius met him and falling at his feet did him reverence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I myself also am a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Conversing with him Peter entered the house and found many people assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them, "You understand that it is against our Law for a Jew to be closely associated with a Gentile or to visit him. But God has taught me not to call any person common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore when I was sent for I came without making any objection. So now I ask, For what reason have you sent for me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cornelius said, "Four days ago, at this hour, I was offering the three o'clock prayer in my house, when suddenly a man stood before me in shining dress</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your gifts of charity have been remembered before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter. He is a guest in the house of Simon a tanner near the sea'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Immediately I sent to you and you have done well in coming. Now here we all are in God's presence to hear all that the Lord has commanded you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I understand that God is not partial,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but in every nation whoever reverences him and lives righteously is acceptable to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As to the message which he sent to the children of Israel telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ \'97 who is Lord of all \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>you know the story that spread through all Judaea. It began in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were harassed by the Devil, for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>We are witnesses of all that he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They hung him on a cross and so killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But God raised him up on the third day and granted that he should become visible,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses previously chosen by God, namely, to us who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>God commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that he is the divinely appointed Judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>All of the prophets testify to this, that every one who believes in him obtains forgiveness of sins through his name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to his message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>All the believers who were of the circumcision who had come along with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>for they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Can any one forbid water for the baptism of these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain there a few days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
