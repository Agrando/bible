They had John as their assistant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After passing through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a Jewish magician and false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>who was in the company of the Proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The Proconsul invited in Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God's message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the magician  opposed them, endeavoring to turn the Proconsul away from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul , full of the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said, "You who are full of every kind of fraud, you son of the Devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you never stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now the hand of the Lord is upon you and you will be blind for a time, unable to see the sun." Immediately a dimness and darkness fell on him, and he went about seeking for people to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sailing away from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them there and returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue directors sent to them saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Paul rose and motioning with his hand said, "Israelites and you who reverence God, listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm brought them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For a period of about forty years he fed them in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After that he gave them judges down to the prophet Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Next they asked for a king and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After removing him, God raised up David to be their king, to whom he bore testimony, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will carry out all my purposes.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Of this man's descendants God, according to his promise, brought to Israel a savior \'97 Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>before whose coming John had proclaimed to all the people of Israel baptism for a change of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As John was finishing his career he used to say, 'What do you think that I am? I am not he. But one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to unfasten.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Brethren, sons of Abraham's race and those among you who reverence God, the message of this salvation has been sent to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers, neither understanding him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled those utterances by condemning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Although they found no ground for putting him to death they begged Pilate to have him killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they had completely done all that had been predicted about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised him from the dead</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"We tell you the good news that the promise to our fathers has been kept;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for God has fulfilled it for our children in raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second psalm, 'Thou art my son; to-day I have become thy father.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as to his raising him from the dead, never to return to decay, he spoke thus; 'I will give you the holy and sure promises made to David.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'Thou wilt not let thy holy one see decay.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David after serving the will of God in his own generation fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he whom God raised up saw no decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Yes, every one who believes in him is cleared from all the sins from which you could not be cleared by the Law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Take care then that what was said in the Prophets does not come on you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>'See, you disdainful ones, and wonder and perish; for I am working a work in your days \'97 a work which you will not believe even if some one fully explains it to you.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these words might be spoken to them on the next Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and of the pious converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them and endeavored to persuade them to hold fast to the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the message of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the Jews, seeing the crowds, were filled with anger and kept speaking in abusive language against what was said by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Paul and Barnabas said with fearless plainness, "The message of God had to be spoken first to you. But since you thrust it away and do not judge yourselves worthy of life eternal \'97 now, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the message of the Lord, and all who were predestined to life eternal believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The message of the Lord was carried abroad through the whole country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews stirred up the pious women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their boundaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>They shook off the dust of their feet as a protest against them, and came to Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
