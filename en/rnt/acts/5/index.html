And after it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Ananias heard these words he fell down and died. Great fear came upon all who heard these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the young men arose and wrapped him in a shroud and carried him out and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After an interval of about three hours, Ananias' wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter asked her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for so much?" She answered, "Yes, for so much."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Peter said to her, "Why was it agreed between you to test the Spirit of the Lord? Even now the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Great awe came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. They were all with one purpose in Solomon's Colonnade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Of the rest no one dared join them, but the people honored them highly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Believers in the Lord were more and more being added, crowds both of men and of women,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that they carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on couches and pallets with the hope that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A crowd was coming too from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were troubled by impure spirits, and these were all being healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the High Priest and all his party \'97 the sect of the Sadducees \'97 became aroused and filled with indignation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and laid hands on the apostles and put them into the public jail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors in the night and led them out and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Go, stand and speak to the people in the Temple courts all the words of this life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On hearing this they went into the Temple courts about daybreak and began teaching. When the High Priest and his party arrived, they called together the Council and all the eldership of the children of Israel and sent to the jail to have the men brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the officers came there they did not find them in the prison. They returned and reported,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"We found the prison shut with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened we found no one inside."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>On hearing these words the commandant of the Temple and the high priests were at a loss as to what this would grow into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then some one came and told them, "The men whom you put in jail are standing in the Temple courts and teaching the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the commandant with his subordinates went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They brought them in and made them stand before the Council. The High Priest asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Did we not strictly order you not to teach in this name? And here you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and want to bring this man's blood on us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Peter, answering for the apostles, said, "God must be obeyed rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>God has exalted him as Leader and Savior at his own right hand to give to Israel change of heart and forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit which God has given to those who obey him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>On hearing this they became furious and wanted to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel \'97 a teacher of the law honored by all the people \'97 arose in the Council and, after directing that the men should be taken outside for a little while,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>said, "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you are going to do to these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For before these days arose Theudas, professing to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him. But he was slain and all who followed him were scattered and came to naught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After him arose Judas the Galilean, in the days of the Census, and led away people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I advise you to keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or work is of men it will collapse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but if it is of God you will not be able to suppress them. You might even be found to be fighting against God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They were persuaded by him. So they called in the apostles and gave them a flogging and ordered them not to go on speaking in the name of Jesus, and then set them at liberty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>but they went away from before the Council rejoicing because they were thought worthy to be put to shame for the Name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And every day in the Temple courts and from house to house they unceasingly taught and told the good news of Jesus the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
