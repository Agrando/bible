yes, I will build up its ruins and erect it again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been bestowed, says the Lord</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who does these things foreknown from of old.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore I judge best not to trouble those of the Gentiles who have turned to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but to write to them to abstain from contamination with idols, and from unchastity, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses has had for generations past in every city those who preach him, for he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to select men from themselves and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, men esteemed among the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They wrote and sent by their hands the following letter: "The Apostles and the Brethren who are elders, to the Brethren from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: Greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, \'97 men whom we did not authorize, \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it seemed good, after unanimous agreement, to select some men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will tell you orally the same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no further burden than these necessary things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from strangled things, and from unchastity. If you keep yourselves from these you will do well. Farewell."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they were sent away and went down to Antioch, where they called together the whole body and delivered over the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On reading it they rejoiced over the encouragement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Both Judas and Silas, being themselves prophets, encouraged and confirmed the brethren by long addresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After spending some time they were sent away with a message of peace from the brethren to those who had sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Paul and Barnabas stayed on in Antioch teaching and telling, in association with many others, the good news of the Lord's message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>After some time Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brethren in every city in which we made known the Lord's message, and see how they are prospering."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Barnabas wished to take along John who was called Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul did not approve of taking him along, since he had left them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them into the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Such a difference of feeling resulted that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Paul selected Silas and left, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
