Are you sitting to judge me by the Law and yet violating the Law by ordering me to be struck?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those who stood by said, "Are you insulting God's High Priest?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Paul said, "I did not know, brethren, that he was High Priest. It is written, 'Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Paul, perceiving that one party was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees, shouted out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being tried for the hope of the resurrection of the dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On his saying this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly became divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor any angel or spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So a great uproar arose, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended, saying, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the strife was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from the midst of them and bring him into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>On the following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, "Courage! As you have witnessed for me in Jerusalem, so you must witness in Rome."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When it was day, the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There were more than forty who had taken this oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They came to the high priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore you and the Council must ask the Tribune to bring him down to you, as if you were going to inquire more exactly about him, and we, before he comes near, will be ready to put him out of the way."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Paul called to him one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has something to tell him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He took him and led him to the Tribune and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Tribune took him by the hand and led him aside and asked, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to-morrow to the Council to inquire something more exactly about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But do not yield to them, for more than forty men of them are lying in ambush, and they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, expecting a promise from you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Tribune dismissed the young man after charging him; "Tell no one that you have revealed this to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then calling to him two of the centurions he said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at nine o'clock to-night."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They were to provide animals for Paul to ride and take him safely to Felix the Governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He wrote a letter in the following form:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Governor Felix: greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came up with soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wishing to find what was the charge that they had against him I took him down to their Council.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I found him accused regarding disputed questions of their law, but of nothing deserving of death or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Information has come to me that there will be a plot against the man, and so I am sending him at once to you, and I have commanded his accusers to state their case against him before you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the soldiers, according to their orders, took Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>On the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, but they themselves returned to the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The horsemen came on to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor, and also placed Paul before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He read the letter and asked of what province he was, and learned that he was from Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he said, "I will hear what you have to say when your accusers also arrive." He gave orders that Paul should be guarded in Herod's castle.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
