"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Felix adjourned the case, since he was well informed regarding the Way, saying, "When Lysias the Tribune comes down, I will inquire into your matters."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He gave orders to the Centurion to guard him, but to let him have indulgence, and not to hinder any of his friends from attending to his wants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him regarding faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>While Paul was reasoning about righteousness and self-discipline and the judgment that is to come, Felix became alarmed and said," Go for the present. When I find a convenient time I will send for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At the same time he was in hopes that money would be given him by Paul and therefore he used to send for him more frequently and converse with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But at the end of two years Felix received Porcius Festus as a successor, and, wishing to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in chains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
