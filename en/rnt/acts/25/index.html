I have not harmed any Jews in anything, as you very well know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not ask not to die. But if there is nothing in the accusations of these men, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, after talking with his council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As they were spending a good many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the King. "There is a man here," he said, "who was left a prisoner by Felix,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>against whom when I was in Jerusalem the high priests and the elders of the Jews had much to say, asking to have him condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any person for punishment before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"So they came along down here and, without making any delay, on the very next day I took my seat on the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When his accusers arose, they brought no charge of such crimes as I was expecting,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but they had some disputes with him about their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died and whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Being at a loss about a question of this kind, I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on the charges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Agrippa said to Festus, "I should like to hear the man myself." "To-morrow," he replied, "you shall hear him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So on the next day Agrippa came and Bernice with much display, and they entered the auditorium with the military tribunes and the principal men of the city, and at Festus' command Paul was led in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Festus said, "King Agrippa and all present here with us, you see this man against whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I understood that he had done nothing worthy of death, and when he himself had appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that after an examination I may have something to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to specify the charges against him."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
