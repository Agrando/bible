This Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way that you have seen him go into heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They then returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Olive Orchard, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey distant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they came into the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying. There were Peter and John, and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All of these continued earnestly and unitedly in prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren  and said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became guide to those who arrested Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was numbered among us and received a share in this service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(This man bought a piece of land with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst asunder and all his entrails were poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, the Field of Blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his dwelling become desolate and let there be no one living in it,' and, 'His overseership let another take.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is needful, therefore, that of the men who have been with us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>from the baptism of John down to the day that he was taken up from us \'97 that one of these should become a witness with us of his resurrection."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they put forward two, Joseph who is called Barsabbas, surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In prayer they said, "O Lord, thou who knowest the hearts of all, show which one of these two thou has chosen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to take the place in this service and apostleship which Judas deserted to go to his own place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they cast lots between them.
