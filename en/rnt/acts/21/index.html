They repeatedly told Paul through the Holy Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But when we had finished the days, we left and continued our journey, and they all with their wives and children escorted us until we got outside of the city. Then, after kneeling down on the beach and praying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>we tore ourselves from one another; we went aboard the ship and they went back to their homes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We made the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais. There we greeted the brethren and remained one day with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and we stayed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Philip had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>During our stay of many days a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He came to see us, and took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When we heard this, both we and the residents there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Paul answered, "What are you accomplishing by weeping and breaking my heart? For I hold myself ready not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he would not be persuaded, we stopped talking, saying, "The Lord's will be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At the end of these days we packed up and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some of the disciples from Caesarea went up with us, taking along Mnason, a Cypriote, an old-time disciple, whose guests we were to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When we reached Jerusalem, the brethren welcomed us cordially.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On the next day, Paul went in with us for an interview with James, and all the elders came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After saluting them, he related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After hearing him, they gave glory to God and said to Paul, "You see, brother, how many tens of thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These have heard reports that you are teaching all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to break away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children and not to observe the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What then? It will be generally heard that you have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So do this that we tell you. There are among us four men who are under a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Take these men and go through purification with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that what they have heard about you amounts to nothing, but that you yourself walk in obedience to the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"But as to the Gentiles that have believed, we have, after consideration, sent our decision that they shall guard themselves against what has been sacrificed to idols, and against blood, and against what has been strangled, and against unchastity."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul on the next day took the men, and, after purifying himself, entered the Temple courts, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification \'97 the time until a sacrifice would have been offered for each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple courts, and stirred up all the crowd and laid their hands on Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>shouting, "Men of Israel, help. This is the man who teaches everybody everywhere against our people and the Law and this place, and moreover, he has brought Greeks into the Temple courts and has desecrated this holy place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul, and they thought that he had brought him into the Temple courts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The whole city was excited and the people rushed together. Seizing Paul, they drew him out of the Temple courts, and immediately the gates were closed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As they were trying to kill him, word went up to the Tribune of the battalion that all Jerusalem was in commotion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the people. They, on seeing the Tribune and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the Tribune coming up arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Some called out one thing and some another in the crowd. Not being able to find out anything for certain on account of the confusion, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When Paul got upon the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the mob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the crowd of people was following and shouting, "Kill him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As he was about to enter the barracks Paul said to the Tribune, "May I say something to you?" He replied, "Can you speak Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Are you then not the Egyptian who some time ago raised a sedition and led off four thousand assassins into the desert?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Paul said, "I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you to let me talk to the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He gave him leave, and Paul standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people. There was a great silence, and, speaking loudly in Hebrew, Paul said:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
