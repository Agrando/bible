This man used to be placed every day near the gate of the Temple courts \'97 the one called the Beautiful Gate \'97 to beg of those who were entering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple courts, he begged to receive something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Peter fixing his eyes on him, along with John, said, "Look at us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He gave attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Peter said, "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have I will give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Grasping his right hand he lifted him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he sprang up and stood and walked and entered the Temple court with them, walking and leaping and praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All the people saw him walking about and praising God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and when they recognized that it was he who had sat begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple court, they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While he still clung to Peter and John, all the people ran crowding around them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade, greatly astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Peter, seeing the people, explained, "Fellow Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you gaze so at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus whom you delivered up and disowned before Pilate when he had decided to release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You disowned the holy and righteous one and begged to have a murderer granted you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You killed the Author of life, but God raised him from the dead. Of this we are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now by faith in his name this man whom you see and know has been made strong by his name, and the faith that is through him has given this man this perfect soundness before you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as also your rulers did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>God in this way fulfilled what he had predicted through the mouths of all the prophets that his Christ should suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, repent and turn about, that your sins may be wiped away and the gracious face of the Lord may bring times of refreshing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he may send Jesus Christ, long ago appointed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouths of his holy prophets of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Moses indeed said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brethren, as he raised me; listen to all that he may say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It shall be that every person who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the prophets, Samuel and those who followed him, all who spoke, also foretold these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God established with your fathers when he said to Abraham, 'In your descendants all the families of the earth will be blessed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To you first God, when he raised up his servant, sent him, to bless you by turning each one of you from his wicked ways."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
