For this is pleasing in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A real widow who is left alone has set her hope on God and devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the pleasure-loving widow, though living, is already dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Give these commands that they may be free from reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If any one does not provide for his own, and especially those of his own household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A widow is to be put on the list if she has reached the age of not less than sixty years, if she has been true to one husband,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>has a reputation for good deeds, has brought up children, has entertained strangers, has washed the feet of the holy, has ministered to people in distress, has been active in every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But younger widows refuse, for when wanton desires lead them away from Christ they wish to marry</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and thus they incur condemnation for breaking their first promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the same time they learn to be idle, going around from house to house, and not only idle, but gossips, and busybodies, saying what they should not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I would, therefore, have the younger widows marry, bear children, keep house, give no occasion to our enemies for slander.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For already some have turned aside after Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any woman who is a believer has widows, she must provide for them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may provide for those who are really widows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The elders who preside well should be thought worthy of double salary, especially those who labor in speaking and teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is treading out the grain," and the workman deserves his wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Against an elder do not receive an accusation unless on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Those who are going on in sin rebuke before all, that the rest may fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to observe these directions without prejudice, doing nothing through partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do not lay hands of ordination upon any one hastily. Have no share in the sins of other men. Keep yourself pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do not keep on being a water-drinker, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and because of your frequent ailments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some men's sins are conspicuous and go on before to condemnation, but the sins of some men follow after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Just so noble deeds are conspicuous and those that are otherwise cannot be hid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
