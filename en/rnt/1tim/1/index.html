But I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the grace of our Lord overflowed in me with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The saying is trust-worthy and deserving of full acceptance that "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," of whom I am the foremost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might show all of his long-suffering for an example for those who are to believe in him and gain life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To the King of the ages, the immortal, invisible, only God, be honor and glory for the ages of the ages!
