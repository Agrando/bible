Teach and urge these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree to wholesome words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to religious teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is conceited, knowing nothing, but morbidly fond of disputes and controversies from which come envy, strife, abusive language, wicked suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and wranglings of men of depraved minds who are destitute of the truth. They think of religion as a source of gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Religion with contentment is a great source of gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot carry anything out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If we have food and clothing we will be content with these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and injurious passions which plunge men into destruction and ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some men grasping for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you, O man of God, must shun this. Pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Play the grand hard game of the faith. Lay hold on life eternal, to which you have been called and have made the noble confession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all, and Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the noble confession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>to keep the commandment stainless and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>which in due time he will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who alone has immortality, who dwells in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen or can see. To him be honor and power eternal! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Command those who are rich in this world not to be haughty nor to fix their hope on uncertain wealth, but on God who provides all things richly for our enjoyment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They must do good work, be rich in noble deeds, be generous, ready to share,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>treasuring up for themselves a good fund for the future, that they may lay hold on the life that is real.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, turning away from profane and empty talk and contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Some while professing it have gone astray as regards the faith. Grace be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
