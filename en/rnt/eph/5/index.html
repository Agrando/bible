Live like children of light \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for the fruit of light appears in all generosity and righteousness and truth \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>testing what is pleasing to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the things that they do in secret it is shameful even to speak of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all things when reproved are shown truly by the light, for everything shown truly is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore it says, "Wake, O sleeper, and rise from the dead and Christ will give you light."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Be strictly careful, then, how you live, not as unwise but as wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Buy up the opportunity, because these are evil days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore do not be thoughtless, but understand what is the Lord's will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not be drunk with wine, in which there is profligacy, but be full of the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and playing the harp heartily to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Be subject to one another in reverence for Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>wives to their own husbands as in the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because a man is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But as the church is subject to Christ, so wives are to their husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that he might make it holy, cleansing it by the washing with water according to his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that he might present to himself the church glorious, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and faultless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for no one ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for we are members of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"This mystery is great, but I am speaking of Christ and the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But each one of you must love his own wife as himself, and the wife must reverence her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
