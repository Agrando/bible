The Lord the righteous judge will give it to me on that day, and not only to me but to all those who have loved his appearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Make haste to come to me quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Demas deserted me because he loved the present world and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When you come, bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, and particularly the parchments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Alexander the coppersmith showed much ill will toward me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Be on your guard against him, for he strongly opposed our teachings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At my first defense no one came to my help; all deserted me. May it not be laid up against them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so that through me the proclamation might be fully published and all the Gentiles might hear it, and I was saved from the mouth of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord will rescue me from every wicked attack and will keep me safe for his heavenly kingdom.
