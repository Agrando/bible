It will grow into greater impiety,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and its teachings will spread like a gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They have gone astray as to the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they are overthrowing the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However, God's solid foundation stands, with this inscription, "The Lord knows his own," and, "Let every one who names the Lord's name turn from wickedness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a great house there are not only utensils of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware, and some are for honorable and others for dishonorable uses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If any one keeps himself pure from these errors, he will be ready for honorable use, holy, fit for the master's service, prepared for every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But flee the passions of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, in the company of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Avoid foolish disputes of the uneducated, knowing that they give rise to quarrels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and the servant of the Lord must not quarrel, but be courteous to all, skillful in teaching, forbearing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>instructing opponents with gentleness, for God may give them a change of heart which will lead them to knowledge of the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and they may return to soberness and escape the snare of the Devil when captured by the Lord's servant to do the Lord's will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
