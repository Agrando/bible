Do not the rich oppress you and drag you before courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they not speak profanely of the noble name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you keep the royal law according to the Scripture, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," you do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you have partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as law-breakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he who keeps the whole law, but stumbles in one point, has become guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," said also, "Thou shalt not commit murder." If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a law-breaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak and so act as those who are soon to be judged by a law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment is merciless to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Of what use is it, my brethren, for any one to say that he has faith, if he has not works? Can faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is naked and lacks food for the day</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and fed," but you do not give them what the body needs, what is the good of it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Just so faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But some one will say, "You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You have faith that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons have that faith, and they shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Are you willing to learn, O vacant-minded man, that faith without works is useless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham, our father, pronounced righteous because of works when he laid Isaac his son on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was made perfect</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness" and he was called "God's friend."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see that a man is pronounced righteous because of works and not because of faith alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way was not Rahab, the prostitute, pronounced righteous because of works when she had received the messengers and sent them out by a different road?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
