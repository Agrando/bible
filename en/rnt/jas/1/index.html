For he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For that man must not think that he will obtain anything from the Lord \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>a two-minded man unsteady in all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let the lowly brother glory in his high station,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and let the rich brother glory in his lowly station, for he will pass away like a flower of the grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the sun rises with scorching heat and dries up the grass, and the flower of it falls and the beauty of its face perishes. So shall the rich man wither in his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has been tested he will gain the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one must say when tempted, "My temptation comes from God." For God cannot be tempted by evil, and he tempts no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own passions and enticed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then when passion has conceived it gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make no mistake, my beloved brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>every good gift and every perfect boon is from above; it descends from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or shadow caused by turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of his own will he made us his children through the message of truth, so that we might be a sort of first fruits of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I wish you to know this, my beloved brethren: Every man must be quick to hear, but slow to speak, slow to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For a man's anger does not work out God's righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So lay aside all that is vile and all that remains of malice, and receive with gentleness the implanted message which can save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Become doers of the message and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if one is a hearer of the message and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He looks at himself and is gone, and immediately forgets what sort of man he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he who looks earnestly into the perfect law of liberty and continues to do so, and becomes not a forgetful hearer but a doer of work \'97 that man will be blessed in what he does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any one thinks himself religious while he does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, that man's religion is worthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure and stainless religion in the sight of God the Father is to visit orphans and widows in their trouble and to keep one's self unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
