Is it not from your pleasures which carry on war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You long for something and do not have it. You murder and envy and cannot obtain it. You battle and war. You do not have, because of your not asking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wickedly to waste it on your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity to God? Whoever chooses to be a friend to the world stands as an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the Spirit which he made dwell in us long enviously?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the Devil and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be sorrowful and mourn and lament. Let your laughter be turned into grief and your gladness into gloom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One is the Lawgiver and Judge \'97 he who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you, to judge your neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come, now, you who say, "To-day or to-morrow we will go to such a city and spend a year and do business and make money,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>though you do not know what your life will be like on the morrow. For you are a vapor that appears for a little while and then disappears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You should rather say, "If the Lord wills it, we shall live and do this or that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you glory in bragging. All such glorying is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any one, then, knows how to do good and is not doing it, he is committing sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
