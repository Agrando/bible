If any one never stumbles in his talk, he is a perfect man, able to bridle also the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If we put bits into the horses' mouths to make them obey us, we turn about their whole bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>See the ships; great as they are and driven by violent winds, they are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the desire of the helmsman chooses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Just so the tongue is a small member, but boasts of great things. Think how small a fire may be and yet how vast the forest that it may set ablaze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, a world of wickedness. The tongue stands among our members as that which spots the whole body and sets on fire the wheel of nature and is itself set on fire by Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of wild beasts and birds and reptiles and animals from the sea is tamed and has been tamed by human kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but the tongue no man is able to tame. It is a restless evil; it is full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless the Lord our Father and with it we curse the men who are made in the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. This, my brethren, should not be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a spring pour out from the same opening sweet water and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a vine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and intelligent among you? Let him show out of the noble life that he lives his works in wise gentleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and party-spirit in your hearts, do not boast and falsely contradict the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom does not come down from on high, but is earthly, animal, demoniacal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where jealousy and party-spirit are, there is confusion and every base affair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom from on high is first pure, then peaceable, fair-minded, easily persuaded, full of compassion and good fruits, impartial, sincere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
