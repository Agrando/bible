In the same way the husband has not power over his own body, but his wife has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do not deprive one another, unless by agreement for a time, that you may have freedom for prayer, and again come together. You must not let Satan tempt you through your lack of self-control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I say this by way of indulgence, not by way of command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I wish that every one were just as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one in one way and one in another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to the unmarried and the widows, it is excellent for them to remain as I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they lack self-control, let them marry. It is better to marry than to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To the married I command \'97 yet not I, but the Lord \'97 that the wife is not to leave her husband</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the husband is not to put away his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To the rest I say \'97 not the Lord: If any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is pleased to live with him, let him not put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is pleased to live with her, let her not put him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband has been made holy by the wife and the unbelieving wife has been made holy by the husband. Otherwise your children would be impure, but now they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbelieving one actually leaves, let him leave. The brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases; but God has called you to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, as the Lord has allotted to each, let each go on living as when God called him. So I prescribe in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was any one already circumcised when called? Let him not efface it. Was any one called when uncircumcised? Let him not become circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God is all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let each stay in that condition in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you called when a slave? Let it not trouble you. On the contrary, even if you can become free, take it in preference.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's freedman. Just so the free man, when called, is the slave of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You were bought with a price. Do not become slaves of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let each one, brethren, stay in that condition in which he was called, close to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In regard to unmarried women I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who through the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I think then that this is an excellent thing on account of the present distress \'97 that it is an excellent thing for a person to be unmarried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Have you been bound to a wife? Seek not release. Have you been freed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But even if you marry, you have not sinned. Even if a maiden marries, she has not sinned. But such will have trouble in the flesh, and I would spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brethren: The time is shortened. For what remains let those who have wives be as if they had none,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and those who weep as if they wept not, and those who rejoice as if they rejoiced not, and those who buy as if they possessed nothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those who use the world as if not overusing it. For the present order of this world is passing away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I wish you to be free from worry. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord \'97 how be may please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The married man is anxious about the things of the world \'97 how he may please his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and his interest is divided. So the unmarried woman or the maiden is anxious about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about the things of the world \'97 how she may please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This I say for your benefit, not to throw a noose over you, but to promote decorum and constant devotion to the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If any one thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin, if she is ripe for marriage and there is need, let him do what he will. He does not sin. Let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He who stands firm in his heart, having no necessity, and has power over his own will and has decided in his heart to keep his virgin, will do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So he who marries his virgin does well, and he who does not marry her will do better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A woman is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband falls asleep, she is free to marry whom she will, though only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But in my opinion she is happier if she stays as she is. And I think that I have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
