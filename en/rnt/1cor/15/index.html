The first-fruit is Christ, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then will be the end when he delivers up the kingship to God his Father, when he has defeated every archangel and authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he must be king until he "puts all his enemies under his feet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy to be defeated will be death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For "he subjected all things under his feet." But when it says, "all things have been subjected," it is plain that it means all things except God who subjected all things to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when all things have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why are they then baptized for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why do we run risks every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I die every day, I swear it by the boast I make of you and which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If, humanly speaking, I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what is my gain? If the dead do not rise, "let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be led astray; "bad associations corrupt good morals."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Return to soberness and cease to sin, for some are ignorant of God. I say it to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what sort of bodies do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thoughtless man! What you yourself sow does not come to life unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what you sow is not the body that will come, but a mere grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives it a body as he has pleased, and to each kind of seed a body of its own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another flesh of birds, and another flesh of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the celestial is of one kind and the glory of the terrestrial is of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars. For star differs from star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also will be the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in decay; it is raised imperishable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is an animal body there is also a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Just as it is written, "The first man Adam became a living animal," the last Adam became a lifegiving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But the spiritual is not first, but the animal, then the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man was from the earth, earthly; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As is the earthly man such are also those who are earthly, and as is the heavenly man such are also those who are heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne the image of the earthly man, we shall bear the image of the heavenly man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I say this, brethren, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor will decay inherit imperishability.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am telling you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be transformed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet-call. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be transformed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this perishable must clothe itself with imperishability, and this mortal must clothe itself with immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When this perishable has clothed itself with imperishability and this mortal has clothed itself with immortality, then will come to pass the word that is written, "Death has been swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O Death, where is thy victory? O Death, where is thy sting?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; since you know that your labor is not fruitless in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
