For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But with the most of them God was not well pleased. For they were strewn in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These things happened as warnings for us, that we may not be eager for evil things as they were eager.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not idolaters, as some of them were, as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to dance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nor let us be unchaste, as some of them were and twenty-three thousand fell dead in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nor let us try the patience of the Lord, as some of them tried him and were destroyed by serpents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor murmur, as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things happened to those people as warnings and they were written for the instruction of us to whom the closing events of the ages have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So let him who thinks that he is standing beware of falling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No trial has taken you but what belongs to human nature. God is faithful and he will not let you be tried beyond your power, but will make, with the trial, a way of escape so that you can endure it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, my beloved, shun idolatry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I speak as to thoughtful men. Judge for yourselves what I am saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship in the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because there is one bread we though many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look at Israel according to the flesh; are not those who eat of the sacrifice partakers of the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What then am I saying? That meat sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I say that what they sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God. And I would not have you become partakers with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Or are we arousing the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things are lawful, but not all are beneficial. All things are lawful, but not all build up character.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one seek his own interest, but the interest of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Everything that is sold in market eat, raising no questions of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For "the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any one of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you, raising no questions of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if any one says to you, "This is meat that has been sacrificed," do not eat, for the sake of him who mentioned it and for conscience' sake \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>conscience, I say, not yours, but the other man's. For why is my liberty judged by the conscience of another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, if you eat or if you drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Cause no offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>as I also in all things accommodate myself to all men, not seeking my own interest but that of the many, in order that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
