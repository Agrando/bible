If the world is to be judged by you, are you unfit for the most trivial cases?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we are to judge angels, to say nothing of affairs of this life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If then you have affairs of this life, do you ask men who in the view of the church count for nothing to sit as judges?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say this to your shame. Is it true that there is among you no one wise enough to judge between a man and his brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but brother goes to law with brother and that before unbelievers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now this is an utter failure on your part that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you yourselves practice wrongs and frauds \'97 and that upon your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit the kingdom of God? Make no mistake, neither the unchaste, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who practice unnatural vices,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor the avaricious, nor drunkards, nor the abusive, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such some of you were. But you have washed yourselves; but you have been made holy; but you have been pronounced righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful for me, but not everything is beneficial. All things are lawful, but I will not be overpowered by anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Food of all kinds is for the stomach and the stomach for foods. But God will end the function of one and the other. The body is not for unchastity, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>God raised the Lord and will also raise us through his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that he who unites himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For God says, "The two shall become one flesh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who is united to the Lord is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Shun unchastity. Every other sin that a man does is apart from the body, but the unchaste sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you were bought with a price. Glorify God then in your bodies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
