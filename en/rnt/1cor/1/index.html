Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am thankful that I baptized no one of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I baptized also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that I do not know that I baptized any one else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the good news \'97 not in wisdom of words, that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nought the prudence of the prudent."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For when in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not come to know God, God was pleased to save through the foolishness of our proclamation those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek for wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we proclaim Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, to Gentiles folly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are called, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For God's foolishness is wiser than men and God's weakness is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Consider your own call, brethren, that not many wise, humanly speaking, not many powerful, not many high-born have been called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the strong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and God has chosen the low-born things and the things of no account, the things that are not, to defeat the things that are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that no human being may boast in God's presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By God's act you are in Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and deliverance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that, as it is written, "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
