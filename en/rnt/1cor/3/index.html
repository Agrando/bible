For you were not able to take it. Nor are you yet able, for you are still fleshly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and living in man's way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For when one says, "I belong to Paul," and another, "I belong to Apollos," are you not men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to faith, as the Lord granted to each of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered, but God made the seed grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then neither is he who planted anything nor he who watered, but God who makes the seed grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We are God's fellow workers: you are God's farm God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God granted to me, as a wise master-builder I have laid a foundation and another is building on it. But let each be careful how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If any one builds on this foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, straw \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>every one's work will become manifest. For the day will show it, because it will be revealed in fire and the fire will test each one's work, of what quality it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If the work which any one has built stands he will get a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any one's work burns up he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that you are God's temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any one mars the temple of God, God will mar him, for the temple of God is holy, and you are the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If any one of you thinks himself wise in this world, let him become a fool in order to become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their own craftiness,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again, "The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise to be futile."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come \'97 all are yours</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and you are Christ's and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
