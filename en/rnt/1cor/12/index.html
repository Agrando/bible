If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has placed the members each one of them in the body as he pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If all were one member, where would be the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now the members are many, but the body is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," or the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Indeed, much more those members of the body that seem to be the weaker are necessary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those that we deem the less honorable parts of the body we surround with greater honor and our uncomely parts have additional dignity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>while our comely parts have no need. But God has organized the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there may be no discord in the body, but that the members may have a common concern for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You are the body of Christ and individually members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God placed some in the church first as apostles, secondly as prophets, thirdly as teachers, then miracle-workers, then those with gifts of healing, helpers, administrators, speakers of different kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle-workers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Seek earnestly for the greater gifts; and yet I will show you a way that surpasses all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
