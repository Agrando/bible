For it is one and the same as if she had her head shaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For if a woman is not covered, then let her cut off her hair. But if it is a shame to a woman to cut off her hair or to shave, let her veil herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a man has no need to cover his head since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For man was not from woman, but woman from man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for man was not formed for woman, but woman for man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, the woman ought to have a badge of authority on her head because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yet neither is woman without man nor man without woman in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as woman is from man so is man through woman, but all things from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Decide for yourselves: is it becoming for a woman to pray to God unveiled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not Nature herself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but that if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? Because the hair is given to her for a covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if any one cares to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In giving the following directions I do not praise you, because you do not assemble for the better, but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, in the first place, I hear that when you assemble as a church there are parties among you, and to some extent I believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must be parties among you in order that it may become plain who are worthy of approval.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When, therefore, you assemble it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For in eating each one tries to get his own supper first and one is hungry and another is drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Have you not homes to eat and drink in? Or do you mean to show contempt for the church of God and put to shame those who have no homes? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? For this I do not praise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord that which I passed on to you that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and when he had given thanks he broke it and said, "This is my body which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner he took also the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in memory of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord's death, until he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he who eats and drinks eats and drinks condemnation to himself, if he does not honor the Lord's body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this reason many are weak and sickly among you and a number are asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If we judged ourselves we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined in order that we may not be condemned along with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then, my brethren, when you assemble to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If any one is hungry, let him eat at home, that your assembling may not bring condemnation on you. The other matters I will arrange when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
