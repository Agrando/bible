Never. For I am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God has not repudiated his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says in the story of Elijah, how he prays to God against Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Lord, they have killed thy prophets: they have demolished thy altars, and I only am left and they are seeking my life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what was the divine response? "I have left to myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So at this present time there is a remnant according to a gracious selection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if it is by grace it is no longer because of works, for then grace would be no longer grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel has not found what it is seeking, but the chosen have found it. And the rest have been made dull,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>as it is written, "God gave them a stupid spirit, eyes not for seeing and ears not for hearing until this day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened so as not to see, and bow down their backs always."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say, then, have they stumbled just in order that they may fall? Never. But by their fall salvation comes to the Gentiles so as to arouse the emulation of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If their fall is the riches of the world and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I say to you Gentiles \'97 since I am an apostle to Gentiles I glory in my office,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if in any way I may arouse to emulation my own kindred and save some of them \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their welcome back be but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If the first fruit was holy, so will the mass be; and if the root was holy, so will be the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If some of the branches were broken off and you, who are a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a sharer in the root and rich sap of the olive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not exult over the branches. Even though you exult, it is not you who are supporting the root, but the root is supporting you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Certainly, for lack of faith they were broken off, and you are standing by faith. Do not be proud, but be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>See the kindness and the rigor of God, toward those who fell rigor, but toward you God's kindness, if you continue in his kindness, else you too will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they if they do not continue in their unbelief will be grafted in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For God is able to graft them back. For if you were cut from your natural stock, a wild olive tree, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a good olive tree, how much more will the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that you may not be self-conceited, because stupidity in a measure has come upon Israel until the full number of Gentiles comes in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written, "From Zion will come the deliverer. He will remove ungodliness from Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>According to the good news they are enemies for your sake, but according to the promise they are beloved for their fathers' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>God never changes his mind about his gifts and his call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as you were once disobedient to God, but now have found mercy through their disobedience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so they have now been disobedient in your time of mercy, that they too may now obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has shut up all in unbelief in order that he may have mercy on all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O the depth of the wealth both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who became his counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who first gave to him so as to receive repayment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory through the ages! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
