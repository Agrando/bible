But if the husband dies, she is freed from the law of her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore while her husband is living she is called an adulteress if she becomes another man's. But if her husband dies she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress when she becomes another man's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So, my brethren, you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ, that you might become wedded to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For when we were in the flesh the sinful passions that arise through the Law were active in our members, so that we bore fruit to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now the Law has been made inoperative on us, since we have died to that by which we were held, so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Never. But I should not have come to know sin except through the Law. I should not have known lust if the Law had not said, "Thou shalt not lust."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Sin, taking occasion through the commandment, worked in me every lust. For apart from the Law sin is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was living once, apart from law. But when the commandment came, sin began to live and I died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the commandment which meant life was found to mean death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the Law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Did then what is good become death to me? Never. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me through the good, in order that it might become beyond measure sinful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For what I am doing I do not understand. For not what I choose is what I practice, but what I hate, this I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if I do what I do not choose, I agree with the law that it is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now it is no longer I that do it, but the Sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>TEXT OMITTED</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find then this rule, when I choose to do the right, that evil is present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I delight in the Law in my inner man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see another law in my members, warring with the law of my mind and leading me captive under the law of sin which is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wretched man that I am! who will deliver me from this body of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then I myself with my mind serve the Law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
