God who is over all be blessed through the ages! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not that God's word has failed. For not all who are of Israel are Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>nor because they are descendants of Abraham are they all children; but "through Isaac shall your descendants be named."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, not the physical descendants are children, but the children of the promise are counted for descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the wording of the promise was, "At this time next year I will come and Sarah shall have a son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only so, but when Rebecca was about to bear children to our father Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>though the same man was father of both children and they were not yet born and had done nothing good or bad, in order that the purpose of God according to his choice might stand, not according to their works, but according to his call,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was said to her, "The older shall serve the younger."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the same way it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness on God's part? Never.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then it is not a question of the man who wills or who runs, but of God who shows mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up in order to show my power upon you and to have my name proclaimed in all the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then he has mercy on whom he chooses and he hardens whom he chooses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who has opposed his will?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But who are you, O man, who are answering back to God? Does the thing that is moulded say to the moulder, "Why have you made me so?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Has not the potter the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What if God, choosing to exhibit his wrath and to make known what he can do, bore in long patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and in order to make known the richness of his glory upon the vessels of mercy which he had prepared for glory</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>called us not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As also he says in Hosea, "Those who are not my people I will call my people, and her who has not been beloved I will call beloved,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they shall be called sons of the living God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah cried aloud regarding Israel, "Though the number of the sons of Israel is as the sand of the sea, only a remnant will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and speedily."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Even as Isaiah predicted, "Unless the Lord of armies had left us some descendants, we should have become like Sodom and should have been made to resemble Gomorrah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained righteousness, the righteousness of faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but Israel pursuing after the Law of righteousness did not attain to the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why? Because they pursued it not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled over that stumbling stone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>as it is written, "See, I am laying in Zion a stumbling stone, a rock to trip over, but he who has faith in him will never be put to shame."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
