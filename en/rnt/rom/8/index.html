If any one has not the Spirit of Christ, that man is not his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If Christ is in you the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead gives life even to your mortal bodies, through his indwelling Spirit in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you did not receive a spirit of bondage leading again to fear, but you received a spirit of sonship, in which we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit itself witnesses with our spirits that we are children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if children, we are also heirs \'97 heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ, since we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I estimate that the sufferings of this present time amount to nothing in comparison with the glory that is to be revealed for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was made subject to folly not willingly, but for the sake of him who subjected it, in hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>because the creation itself will be freed from the slavery of decay into the glorious freedom of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that all the creation groans in the pangs of childbirth until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not the creation alone, but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves in expectation of the sonship, the liberation of our bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we are saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for what any one sees, why does he hope for?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we do not see, we patiently wait for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus also the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with sighs beyond words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the holy according to the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For those whom he foreknew he also predetermined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And those whom he predetermined he also called, and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous, and those whom he pronounced righteous he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who is against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how shall he not with him graciously give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? God pronounces them righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is there to condemn? Christ Jesus died, or rather was raised, and he is on the right hand of God interceding for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from Christ's love? Shall trial or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?</span> <span class="verse note empty"><a name="36">36</a>As it is written, "For thy sake we are killed all the day. We are counted as sheep for slaughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the contrary, in all these we more than conquer through him who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor archangels, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God's love in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
