For there is no authority except from God and the actual authorities have been appointed by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So he who resists the authority opposes the arrangement of God. Those who resist will bring on themselves condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are not a terror to good deeds, but to bad. Do you wish not to fear the authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he is a servant of God to promote your good. But if you are doing evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword to no purpose. For he is God's servant to inflict his wrath on him who practices evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore we must be obedient, not only because of the punishment but as a matter of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this reason also you pay tribute. For they are God's officers attending to this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Pay to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no one anything, except to love one another. He who loves the other has fulfilled the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the commandments, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," "Thou shalt not commit murder," "Thou shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not covet," and any other that there may be, are summed up in this: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love works no evil to a neighbor. Love therefore is full obedience to the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Live thus because you know this crisis, for it is already time for you to awake from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we became believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far spent, the day draws near. Let us put away the deeds of darkness, let us put on the weapons of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us live becomingly as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in sensuality and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for gratifying physical passions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
