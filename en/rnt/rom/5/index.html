For a good man some one perhaps may dare to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But God shows his own love to us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Much more then, now that we have been pronounced righteous through his blood, shall we be saved from wrath by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if while enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And not only so, but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained the reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore as through one man sin entered the world, and through sin death entered, and so death spread to all men, since all sinned \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for down to the time of the Law sin was in the world, and yet sin is not charged where there is no law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned like Adam, who is the type of him who was coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the gracious gift is not like the fall. For if by the fall of the one the many sinned, much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the free gift was not like the sentence that came through one who sinned; for the sentence came from one fall for condemnation, but the free gift was that men should be called righteous in spite of many falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if by the fall of one man death reigned through that one, much more those who receive the abounding grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through one, that is, through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As then through one fall sentence came upon all men and they were condemned; so through one righteous act the free gift came to all men so that they are pronounced righteous and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as by the disobedience of the one man the many were set down as sinners, so by the obedience of the one the many will be set down as righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But law came in alongside that the fall might be greater; but where sin became greater grace became greater still,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>in order that as sin reigned in death grace might reign through righteousness and issue in life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
