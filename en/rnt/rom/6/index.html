Shall we remain in sin so that grace may be great?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Never. How shall we who died to sin still live in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if we have grown into union with him by the likeness of his death, surely we shall be united with him by the likeness of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For we know this, that our old-time humanity was crucified with him, in order that the sinful body might be made powerless, that we might no longer be slaves of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For one who has died has been pronounced righteous and free from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if we died with Christ we believe that we shall live with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>knowing that Christ, after being raised from the dead, dies no more; death no more reigns over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the death that he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So you must think yourselves dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you will obey its lusts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and do not yield your members to sin as the instruments of wickedness; but present yourselves to God as men once dead, but now living, and yield your members to God as the instruments of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For sin shall not be king over you; for you are not under law, but under grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then? May we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Never.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as servants intending obedience, you are the servants of the one you obey, whether of sin, resulting in death, or of obedience, resulting in righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to the type of teaching in which you were instructed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You were made free from sin and made servants to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am speaking humanly on account of the weakness of your human nature. As you did present your members as servants to impurity and to lawlessness to do lawlessness, so now you have presented your members as servants to righteousness for holy living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What fruit did you have then? Fruit of which you are now ashamed; for the end of those things is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now freed from sin and having become servants of God you have your fruit in holy living and its outcome, life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
