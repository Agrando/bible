For in judging another you condemn yourself. For you, the judge, practice the same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you think, O man, you who judge those who practice such things while you do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the kindness of God is calling you to a change of heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Are you with a hard and unrepentant heart treasuring for yourself wrath for the day of wrath and for the revelation of the just judgment of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He will give to each an award according to his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To those who by constancy in good work seek for glory and honor and immortality he will award life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But to those of a partisan spirit who do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and hot anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Distress and crushing calamity will fall upon every human soul that works evil, upon the Jew first and also upon the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But glory and honor and peace will come to every one who works good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For God has no partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As many as have sinned without a law will perish without a law, and as many as have sinned under law will be judged by law</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>(for it is not the hearers of law who are righteous before God, but the doers of law are pronounced righteous;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for when Gentiles who have no law do by nature what the Law enjoins, these, although they have no law, are a law to themselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>they show the requirements of the Law written in their hearts, since their conscience corroborates it and their thoughts argue in mutual accusation or in self-defense),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>on the day when God judges the secrets of men through Jesus Christ, as my good news sets forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law, and make your boast in God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and know his will and are a judge of things that differ, because you have been taught out of the Law</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>an instructor of the unwise, a teacher of the simple, because you have the form of knowledge and of truth in the Law \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>you who are teaching another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You who boast of the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For "The name of God is reviled among the Gentiles because of you," as it is written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Circumcision has value if you obey the Law. But if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If an uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the natural uncircumcision if it keeps the Law will judge you who with a written code and circumcision are still a law-breaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it is not he who is one outwardly that is a Jew, nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he who is one secretly is a Jew, and circumcision is of the heart and in the spirit, not in the letter.
