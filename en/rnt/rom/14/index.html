The weak man eats vegetables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The man who eats is not to despise the one who does not eat, and he who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats. For God has accepted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls, and stand he will, for God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One man esteems one day above another, another man esteems every day. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who regards the day regards it to the Lord and he who eats eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God. And he who does not eat abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For no one of us is living for himself and no one dies for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If we live we live for the Lord and if we die we die for the Lord. So whether we live or die we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ died and lived again, in order that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you treat your brother with contempt? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, "As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bend to me and every tongue shall confess to God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each one of us shall give account for himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let us no longer judge one another, but let us rather decide not to put a stumbling block in a brother's way, or anything to trip him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiling in itself. But to one who thinks anything to be defiling it is defiling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If because of your food your brother is grieved, you are no longer walking in love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not let what is good to you be spoken of as evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he who thus serves Christ is pleasing to God and esteemed by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, let us seek for what makes for peace and our mutual upbuilding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not for the sake of food break down the work of God. All things are pure, but anything is evil to the man who eats it with a feeling of doing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is noble not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything over which your brother stumbles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The faith that you have, have to yourself before God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself for what he allows himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who has doubts and still eats stands condemned, because he is not acting from faith. But whatever does not spring from faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
