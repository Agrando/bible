For if the Gentiles have shared their things of the spirit, they owe them sacred service in things of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So after completing this and sealing to them this fruit, I shall come away and pass by you to Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know that when I come to you it will be in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I beg you, brethren, for the sake of our Lord Jesus and the love of the Spirit to join me in wrestling in prayer to God on my behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judaea and that my service in Jerusalem may be pleasing to the holy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and be refreshed with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The God of peace be with all of you!
