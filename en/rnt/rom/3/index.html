First, they were intrusted with the oracles of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what if some were faithless, will their faithlessness prevent the faithfulness of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Never. Let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written, "That thou mayest be proved right in thy words and triumph when thou art judged."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous when he inflicts his wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Never. If so how can God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the truth of God has become more abundant to his glory through my lie, why am I still condemned as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We are not going to say, as some people slanderously affirm that we say, "Let us do evil that good may come," are we? The condemnation of such people is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Have we an advantage? Not at all. We have already brought the charge against both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as it is written, "There is not even one righteous;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>there is none that seeks God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All have turned away; together they have become worthless; there is none who does what is useful, not even one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they deceive; the poison of asps is under their lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>their feet are swift to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>ruin and misery are in their paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The path of peace they do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no reverence for God before their eyes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that all that the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law, that every mouth may be shut and all the world may come under the condemnation of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore by works of the Law no human being will be pronounced righteous before him. For through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now, apart from law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, confirmed by the Law and the Prophets \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>a righteousness from God through faith in Jesus Christ for all believers. For there is no difference.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All are pronounced righteous by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God has set forth as a propitiation by his blood through faith, for the manifestation of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previous sins in the forbearance of God \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for a manifestation at the present time of his righteousness, that he may himself be righteous and may accept as righteous him who has faith in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? That of works? No, but by the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For we reason that a man is pronounced righteous by faith aside from works of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Does God belong to the Jews only? Does he not belong also to the Gentiles? Yes, to the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>if God is one and will pronounce the circumcision righteous by faith and the uncircumcision righteous through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then by faith nullify the Law? Never. On the contrary we establish the Law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
