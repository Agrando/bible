It is the power of God for salvation to every one who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For a righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, as it is written, "He who is righteous by faith shall live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and wickedness of men who hold the truth but practice unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because what may be known of God is manifest within them, for God has manifested it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For God's invisible qualities \'97 his everlasting power and deity \'97 are, since the creation of the world, clearly seen, being known from what he has made. So they are without any excuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For although they knew God they did not glorify him as God and did not give him thanks, but fell into futile speculations and their stupid hearts were darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Boasting of being wise, they became fools</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into images of mortal man, and of birds and beasts and reptiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore God gave them over, in the lusts of their hearts, to uncleanness, to dishonor their bodies mutually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They changed the truth of God into a lie, and reverenced and paid worship to the creature rather than to the Creator \'97 who is blessed forever, Amen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore God gave them over to disgraceful passions. For their females changed the natural use for one contrary to nature,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and their males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust for one another, males with males practicing indecency and receiving in themselves the deserved penalty of their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And as they did not think fit to keep God in their knowledge, God gave them over to an abandoned mind, to do the things that are shameful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>filled with all injustice, wickedness, greed, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, fraud, malignant craftiness, whisperers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>without common sense, without faithfulness, without family affection, without pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They know the just judgment of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death, yet they not only do them themselves, but are pleased with those who practice them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
