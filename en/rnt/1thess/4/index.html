For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and you do the same to all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still further</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and to be ambitious to lead a quiet life and to mind each his own business and to work with your hands, as we instructed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus you will live becomingly in the sight of outsiders and will have need of nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, regarding those who are sleeping, that you may not sorrow as the rest of men who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For since, as we believe, Jesus died and rose, so too God will through Jesus bring with him those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This we tell you by the word of the Lord: We, the living, who have been left until the coming of the Lord, will not have the start of those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel and with God's trumpet-call, and first the dead in Christ will rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then we, the living, who are left, will be caught up along with them into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall forever be with the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So encourage one another with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
