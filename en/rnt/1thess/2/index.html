All this goes always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's fiercest wrath has overtaken them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we, brethren, when bereft of you for a little while, out of sight not out of mind, endeavored more earnestly to see your faces, with great longing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For that reason we determined to come to you, yes, I, Paul, more than once: but Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You are our glory and joy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
