They were submissive to their own husbands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him Master. You have become her children when you do well and feel no terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the same way, you husbands must live with your wives wisely, since woman's sex is weaker, but you must give them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, all must be like-minded, sympathetic, full of brotherly love, compassionate, humble-minded,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>not repaying evil for evil or abuse for abuse, but rather blessing, for that is what you were called for \'97 to inherit a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For "He who would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against wrongdoers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And who is it that will harm you if you become earnest for the good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you should suffer for being righteous, you are blessed. Have no fear of them and do not be disturbed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but exalt Christ as Lord in your hearts and be always ready to defend yourselves to every one who asks you to give account of the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Keep a good conscience that, although you are slandered, those who misrepresent your good life in Christ may be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better to suffer, if that should be God's will, for doing good than for doing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Christ once for all died for sins, a righteous man for unrighteous men, so that he might lead us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who were once disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared, into which a few, that is eight souls, went and were saved through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is a type of baptism, which now saves us \'97 not the putting off of soil from the flesh, but the endeavor for a good conscience toward God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now that he has gone into heaven he is at the right hand of God, and angels and authorities and powers have been made subject to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
