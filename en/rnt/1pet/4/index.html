For he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>so that he does not go on living what remains of his time in the flesh according to human passions, but according to God's will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The time that has passed was enough to spend doing the will of the Gentiles, when you went on in indecencies, passions, hard drinking, revelries, carousings, and lawless idolatries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In these they think it strange that you are not running with them to the same excess of profligacy, and they slander you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they will have to give account to him who holds himself ready to judge the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And for this purpose the good news was told even to the dead, that they might be judged like men in the flesh, but live as God does in the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The end of all things is near. Therefore be serious and sober and give yourselves to prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Above all things have earnest love to one another, for love hides a host of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let each, as he has received a spiritual gift, serve the others in that way, as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If any one speaks, let it be as uttering the oracles of God. If any one serves, let it be from the strength that God supplies. Thus in all things let God be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him be glory and strength for the ages of the ages! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery fury that is among you, which has come to try you, as if some strange thing were happening to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But rejoice since to this extent you are sharing the sufferings of Christ, that when his glory is revealed you may rejoice and exult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you are reproached for the name of Christ you are blessed, for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No one of you must suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as a wrongdoer or as a meddler in other men's affairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he suffers as a Christian he should not be ashamed, but should glorify God by that name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God. And if it begins first with us, what will be the end of those who disobey the good news of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the righteous is saved with difficulty, where will the godless and sinful appear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then let those who are suffering according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
