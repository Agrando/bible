He who has faith in him will not be put to shame."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To you who have faith is the "honor," but to the unbelieving "the stone which the builders rejected \'97 that has become the corner stone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>a stone for the foot to strike, a rock to stumble over." Their feet strike the message because of their unbelief, and to this they were destined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people, that you may proclaim the virtues of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God: once you had not found compassion, but now you have found compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, I beg you, as foreigners and resident aliens, to shun the passions of the flesh which war against the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Keep your daily life among the Gentiles honorable, so that, although they talk against you as if you were wrongdoers, they may, from your noble deeds that they see, glorify God on the day of inspection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be submissive to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governors as those sent by him for the punishment of wrongdoers and the praise of those who do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this is the will of God \'97 that by doing good we shall silence the ignorance of thoughtless men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Live as free men, yet not using freedom as a cloak for wickedness, but as God's slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Honor all men, love the brotherhood, reverence God, honor the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Household servants, be submissive with all reverence to your lords, not only to the good and fair, but also to the surly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For this is grace if for conscience toward God any one bears pain, suffering unjustly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what credit is it if when you sin and are struck with the fist you are patient? But if though doing well, you suffer and are patient, that is grace in God's sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to this you were called, because Christ too suffered for you, leaving you an example that you might follow in his foot-steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He had done no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he was reviled he did not revile back; he suffered, but made no threat; he committed himself to him who judges justly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He bore our sins in his own body on the tree that we might die to sins and live to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were going astray like sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
