For the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If the service that brought death, engraved in letters on stones, came in glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face \'97 that fading glory \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>how much more glorious will not the service of the Spirit be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For if the service that brought condemnation was glory, much more will the service that brings righteousness surpass in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For what was made so glorious is in a way no longer glorious compared with the glory that surpasses it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For if what was to be ended came in glory, much more glorious must be that which is enduring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>With such a hope then we speak with great frankness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel might not see when the vanishing glory ended;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but their thinking was dulled.
