Yes, bear with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God, for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But I fear that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts may be led away from sincerity and purity toward Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if some newcomer proclaims another Jesus whom we did not proclaim, or if you receive a different kind of spirit which you did not receive, or a different good news which you did not welcome, you bear with him finely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I consider that I am in nothing inferior to the most eminent apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If I am an ordinary man in speaking, still I am not in knowledge, but in everything we made that altogether clear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Did I commit a sin when I humbled myself that you might be exalted, because I proclaimed to you the good news of God without pay?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I robbed other churches by taking wages for serving you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and when I was with you and in need I was not a burden to any one, for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my need. In every way I kept myself from being a burden to you, and shall keep myself so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine shall not be stopped in the region of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I am doing I shall do so as to cut away all ground of attack from those who wish ground, and that in what they boast of they may be found just like us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder, for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So it is no great thing if his servants too disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be according to their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, let no one think me foolish. But, even if so, receive me as foolish, that I too may boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I am saying I am not saying by the Lord's command, but as it were in foolishness, in this confident boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I too will boast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for you who are wise bear pleasantly with the foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You bear it if any one enslaves you, if any one devours you, if any one takes possession of you, if any one exalts himself, if any one strikes you in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I say it with shame as if we had been weak. But in whatever any one is bold  I too am bold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descended from Abraham? So am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they servants of Christ?  I superlatively \'97 in labors beyond measure, in prisons beyond measure, in floggings excessively, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From Jews five times I received forty stripes less one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was ship-wrecked, a night and day I have been in the deep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in journeys often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own race, in perils from Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the open country, in perils on the sea, in perils among false brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in toil and labor, in many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Aside, from other things there is that which weighs on me daily, anxiety for all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak and I am not weak? Who stumbles and I am not burning?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If there must be boasting, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows, he who is blessed forever, that I am not lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the Governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes to arrest me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and through a window I was lowered in a basket and escaped from his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
