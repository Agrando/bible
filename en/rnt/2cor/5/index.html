What we are is plain to God, and I hope that it is also plain to your consciences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We are not recommending ourselves again to you, but giving occasion to you for boasting on our behalf, that you may have it to use against those who boast of appearances and not of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if we were out of our minds it was for God, and if we are sane it is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the love of Christ impels us, convinced of this, that if one died for all, then all died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he died for all that the living may no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So we, from now on, know no man according to the flesh. Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So if any one is in Christ he is a new creature. The old things have passed away, they have become new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all things are from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and given to us the service of reconciliation \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to proclaim that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting against men their sins, and that he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were appealing to you through us. We pray you on Christ's behalf to be reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Him who knew no sin God made sin for our sake that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
