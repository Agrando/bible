If we are encouraged, it is for your encouragement which is effective in the endurance of the same sufferings that we suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our hope is strong regarding you, since we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings so you are of the encouragement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, regarding the distress that came on us in Asia \'97 that we were exceedingly weighed down, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Indeed we have the sentence of death within ourselves, that our trust may not rest on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He delivered us from such a death and will deliver, and we have hope in him that he will go on delivering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>while you help by your prayers for us, so that from many persons thanksgiving may arise for the gift granted to us through the prayers of many for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this is what we boast of, the witness of our conscience that in holiness, and sincerity before God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have lived in the world and especially toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For we are not writing to you anything but what you read and acknowledge and I hope you will acknowledge to the end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as you have partly acknowledged it about us, that we are your ground of boasting and you are ours on the day of our Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>With this confidence I intended to come to you first, so that you might have a second favor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>by my visiting you on the way to Macedonia and again coming back from Macedonia to you and being sped by you on my way toward Juda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When I was intending this, did I show fickleness? Or do I plan what I plan according to the flesh, so that I may say yes, yes, and no, no?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As God is faithful, my word to you is not yes and no.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was proclaimed among you by us \'97 myself and Silvanus and Timothy \'97 was not yes and no, but in him was yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For all the promises of God, however many, have their yes in him. Therefore also through him is the Amen to the glory of God through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is God who makes us and you steadfast to Christ, and has anointed us</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and sealed us and has given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I call God as a witness against my soul that in order to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not that we are lords over your faith, but fellow workers sharing your joy, for you are standing firm in the faith.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
