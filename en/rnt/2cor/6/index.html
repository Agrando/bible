Now is a particularly favorable time, now is a day of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We give no occasion for stumbling to any one that our service may not be blamed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but in everything we commend ourselves as God's servants in great patience, in distresses, in necessities, in hardships,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>in floggings, in prisons, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>with purity, with knowledge, with long-suffering, with kindness, with the Holy Spirit, with sincere love,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>with the message of truth, with the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and the left,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>by honor and shame, by slander and praise; as deceivers yet true,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as unknown yet well known, as dying and yet we are living, as chastised yet not put to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet owning all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians, our heart expands itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You find no narrowness in us, the narrowness is in your own sympathies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As a fair return, I am speaking as to my children, let your hearts expand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do not be yoked up, like unmatched animals, with unbelievers.
