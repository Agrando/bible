I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago \'97 whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not; God knows \'97 such a man caught up to the third heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I know such a man \'97 whether in the body or out of the body I know not; God knows \'97</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for man to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of such a one I will boast, but of myself I will not boast except of my weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even if I choose to boast I shall not be foolish, for I shall speak the truth. But I guard myself that no one may think of me beyond what he sees me to be, or hears from me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and because of the surpassing nature of the revelations. For this reason, that I should not be puffed up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to torment me, so that I should not be puffed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Regarding this I three times begged the Lord that it might leave me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you; for power is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly then will I boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may abide upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I rejoice in weaknesses, in rough treatment, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become foolish; you made me. For I ought to have been recommended by you. For in nothing have I been inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The signs of an apostle were performed among you in all patience by miracles and wonders and deeds of power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>What is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the churches except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now this third time I am ready to come to you, and I shall not be a burden to you. For I am not seeking yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up money for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you too much, am I loved the less?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be that as it may, I was not a burden to you. But being crafty I caught you with cunning?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I take advantage of you through any one of those I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I begged Titus to go, and I sent along with him the brother. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit and walk in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Are you thinking all this while that we are defending ourselves to you? We are speaking before God in Christ. All this, beloved, is to build you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I am afraid that when I come I shall not find you such as I wish, and I myself may not be found by you such as you wish. I am afraid that there may be strife, jealousy, anger, rivalry, slanders, whisperings, conceit, disorders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am afraid that when I come again my God may humble me in your presence, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have been long sinning and have not repented of the impurity and unchastity and sensuality which they have practiced.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
