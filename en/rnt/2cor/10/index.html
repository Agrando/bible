If any one is confident that he belongs to Christ, let him again consider this regarding himself, that just as he belongs to Christ so also do we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if I boast somewhat excessively of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for pulling you down, I shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let me not seem as if meaning to frighten you by letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because, "His letters," they say, "are mighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak and his speaking amounts to nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a person consider this, that what we are in words by letters when absent such we will be in deeds when present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We do not venture to class ourselves or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves. But they, measuring themselves among themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, do not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the measuring rod which God assigned to us, and that reaches as far as you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are not stretching ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we were the first to reach you with the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We are not boasting beyond measure in the labors of others, but we have hope that as your faith grows we may have larger influence among you according to our measure and beyond,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so that we may tell the good news to the regions lying beyond you and not boast of things already done in some other man's territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
