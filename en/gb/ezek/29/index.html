Behold, I [am] against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great  dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river [is] my own, and I have made [it] for myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I will put  hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick to thy scales, and I will bring thee out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick to thy scales.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will leaue thee in the wildernes, both thee & al the fish of thy riuers: thou shalt fal vpon ye open field: thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: for I haue giue thee for meat to the beasts of the field, and to the foules of heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I [am] the LORD, because they have been a staff of  reed to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and tear all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst break, and make all their inward parts to  shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde God, Beholde, I will bring a sworde vpon thee, and destroy man and beast out of thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD: because he hath said,  The river [is] mine, and I have made [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, therefore I come vpon thee, and vpon thy riuers, & I will make the land of Egypt vtterly waste and desolate from the towre of Seueneh, euen vnto the borders of the blacke Mores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No foote of man shall passe by it, nor foote of beast shall passe by it, neither shall it be inhabited fourtie yeeres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I wil make the land of Egypt desolate in the middes of the countries, that are desolate, and her cities shall be desolate among the cities that are desolate, for fourtie yeeres: and I wil scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and wil disperse them through the countreis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet thus saieth the Lord God, At the end of fourtie yeeres will I gather the Egyptians from the people, where they were scattered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will bring again the captives of Egypt, and will cause them to return [into] the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a  base kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It shall be the smallest of the kingdomes, neither shall it exalt it selfe any more aboue the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth [their]  iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass in the  seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great  service against Tyre: every head [was] made bald, and every shoulder [was] rubbed raw: yet had he no wages,  nor his army, for Tyre, for the service that he had served against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus sayth the Lorde God, Beholde, I will giue the land of Egypt vnto Nebuchad-nezzar the King of Babel, and he shall take her multitude, and spoyle her spoyle, and take her pray, and it shall be the wages for his armie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I haue giuen him the land of Egypt for his labour, that he serued against it, because they wrought for me, sayth the Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that day will I cause the horne of the house of Israel to growe, and I will giue thee an open mouth in the middes of them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
