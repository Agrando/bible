Thus [were] their names; Samaria [is] Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Aholah played the harlot when  she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Which were clothed with blewe silke, both captaines and princes: they were all pleasant yong men, and horsemen riding vpon horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus she committed her whoredome with them, euen with all them that were the chosen men of Asshur, and with all on whome she doted, and defiled her selfe with all their idoles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neither left she her harlotries [brought] from Egypt: for in her youth they  lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their immorality upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Wherefore I deliuered her into the hands of her louers, euen into the hands of the Assyrians, vpon whome she doted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for  they had executed judgment upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when her sister Aholibah sawe this, she marred her selfe with inordinate loue, more then she, and with her fornications more then her sister with her fornications.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She doted vpon the Assyrians her neighbours, both captaines and princes clothed with diuers sutes, horsemen ryding vpon horses: they were all pleasant yong men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I sawe that she was defiled, and that they were both after one sort,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And [that] she increased her harlotries: for when she saw men  portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And girded with girdles vpon their loynes, and with dyed attyre vpon their heads (looking all like princes after the maner of the Babylonians in Caldea, the land of their natiuitie)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Assoone, I say, as she sawe them, she doted vpon them, and sent messengers vnto them into Caldea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nowe when the Babylonians came to her into the bed of loue, they defiled her with their fornication, and she was polluted with them, and her lust departed from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So she discouered her fornication, and disclosed her shame: then mine heart forsooke her, like as mine heart had forsaken her sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet she encreased her whoredome more, and called to remembrance ye dayes of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For she doted vpon their seruants whose members are as the members of asses, and whose yssue is like the yssue of horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou calledst to remembrance the wickednes of thy youth, when thy teates were bruised by ye Egyptians: therefore ye paps of thy youth are thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus sayeth the Lord God, Beholde, I will raise vp thy louers against thee, from whome thine heart is departed, and I will bring them against thee on euery side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans,  Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Euen these shal come against thee with charets, waggons, and wheeles, and with a multitude of people, which shall set against thee, buckler and shield, and helmet round about: and I will leaue the punishment vnto them, and they shall iudge thee according to their iudgements.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy  nose and thy ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy remnant shall be devoured by the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They shal also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fayre iewels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thus wil I make thy wickednes to cease from thee and thy fornication out of the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift vp thine eyes vnto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I wil deliuer thee into the hand of them, whome thou hatest: euen into the hands of them from whome thine heart is departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy  labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy harlotries  shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy harlotries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I wil doe these things vnto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idoles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her  cup into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus saith ye Lord God, Thou shalt drinke of thy sisters cup, deepe and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorne and had in derision, because it containeth much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thou shalt be filled with  drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of horror and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Thou shalt euen drinke it, and wring it out to the dregges, and thou shalt breake the sheards thereof, and teare thine owne breasts: for I haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore thus saith the Lorde God, Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behinde thy backe, therefore thou shalt also beare thy wickednes and thy whoredome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Lord sayd moreouer vnto me, Sonne of man, wilt thou iudge Aholah & Aholibah? and wilt thou declare to them their abominations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>That they have committed adultery, and blood [is] in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through [the fire], to  devour [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Moreouer, thus haue they done vnto me: they haue defiled my Sanctuarie in the same day, and haue prophaned my Sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For when they had slaine their children to their idoles, they came the same day into my Sanctuarie to defile it: and loe, thus haue they done in the middes of mine house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from  far, to whom a messenger [was] sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, didst paint thy eyes, and didst deck thyself with ornaments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And satest  upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, upon which thou hast set my incense and my oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And a voice of a multitude being at ease [was] with her: and with the men of the common sort [were] brought  Sabeans from the wilderness, who put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then I sayd vnto her, that was olde in adulteries, Now shall she and her fornications come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they went in vnto her as they goe to a common harlot: so went they to Aholah and Aholibah the wicked women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of  adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Wherefore thus sayth the Lord God, I will bring a multitude vpon them, and will giue them vnto the tumult, and to the spoyle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And the multitude shall stone them with stones, and cut them with their swordes: they shal slay their sonnes, and their daughters, and burne vp their houses with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all  women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they shall laye your wickednesse vpon you, and ye shall beare the sinnes of your idoles, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
