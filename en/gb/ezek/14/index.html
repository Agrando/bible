Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the  prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude  of his idols;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That  I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therfore say vnto the house of Israel, Thus sayth the Lord God, Returne, and withdraw your selues, and turne your faces from your idoles, and turne your faces from all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For euery one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that soiourneth in Israel, which departeth from mee, and setteth vp his idoles in his heart, and putteth the stumbling blocke of his iniquitie before his face, and commeth to a Prophet, for to inquire of him for me, I the Lord will answere him for my selfe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an example and prouerbe, and I will cut him off from the middes of my people, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if the prophet be  deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall beare their punishment: the punishment of the Prophet shall bee euen as the punishment of him that asketh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That the house of  Israel may no more go astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions;
