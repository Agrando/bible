he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations;  he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if he beget a sonne, that seeth all his fathers sinnes, which he hath done, and feareth, neither doeth such like,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, neither hath lift vp his eyes to the idols of ye house of Israel, nor hath defiled his neighbours wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Neither hath oppressed any, nor hath withholden the pledge, neither hath spoyled by violence, but hath giuen his bread to the hungry, and hath couered the naked with a garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither hath withdrawen his hand from the afflicted, nor receiued vsurie nor increase, but hath executed my iudgements, and hath walked in my statutes, he shall not die in the iniquitie of his father, but he shal surely liue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His father, because he cruelly oppressed and spoyled his brother by violence, and hath not done good among his people, loe, euen he dyeth in his iniquitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet say ye, Wherefore shall not the sonne beare the iniquitie of the father? because ye sonne hath executed iudgement & iustice, and hath kept all my statutes, and done them, he shal surely liue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The same soule that sinneth, shal die: the sonne shall not beare the iniquitie of the father, neither shall the father beare the iniquitie of the sonne, but the righteousnes of the righteous shall be vpon him, and the wickednesse of the wicked shall be vpon him selfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my  statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned to him: in his  righteousness that he hath done he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: [and] not that he should return from his ways, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, [and] doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked [man] doeth, shall he live? All his  righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not  equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousnes, and committeth iniquitie, he shall euen die for the same, he shal euen die for his iniquitie, that he hath done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Againe when the wicked turneth away from his wickednes that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawfull and right, he shal saue his soule aliue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that hee hath committed, he shall surely liue and shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet saith ye house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equall. O house of Israel, are not my wayes equall? or are not your wayes vnequall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore I will iudge you, O house of Israel, euery one according to his wayes, sayth the Lord God: returne therefore and cause others to turne away from all your transgressions: so iniquitie shall not be your destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed; and make  you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I desire not the death of him that dyeth, sayth the Lord God: cause therefore one another to returne, and liue ye.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
