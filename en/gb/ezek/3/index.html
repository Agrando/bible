Then did I eate it, and it was in my mouth as sweete as honie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, goe, and enter into the house of Israel, and declare them my wordes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thou art not sent to a people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an hard language, but to the house of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not to many people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an harde language, whose wordes thou canst not vnderstand: yet if I should sende thee to them, they would obey thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not obey thee: for they will not obey me: yea, all the house of Israel are impudent and stiffe hearted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have made thy  face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I haue made thy forehead as the adamant, and harder then the flint: feare them not therefore, neither be afraid at their lookes: for they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee  receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And goe and enter to them that are led away captiues vnto the children of thy people, and speake vnto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord God: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying],  Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I heard also the noyse of the wings of the beasts, that touched one another, and the ratling of the wheeles that were by them, euen a noyse of a great russhing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I  went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I came to them of the captivity at  Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there overwhelmed among them  seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And at the ende of seuen dayes, the worde of the Lorde came againe vnto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, I have made thee a  watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I shall say vnto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die, and thou giuest not him warning, nor speakest to admonish the wicked of his wicked way, that he may liue, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquitie: but his blood will I require at thine hande.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wickednesse, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquitie, but thou hast deliuered thy soule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, When a  righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a  stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his  righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Neuerthelesse, if thou admonish that righteous man, that the righteous sinne not, and that he doeth not sinne, he shall liue because he is admonished: also thou hast deliuered thy soule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the  hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the  glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the spirit entered into me, and  set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go,  shut thyself within thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thou, O sonne of man, beholde, they shall put bandes vpon thee, and shall binde thee with them, and thou shalt not goe out among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will make thy tongue  cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they [are] a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I shall haue spoken vnto thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, He that heareth, let him heare, and he that leaueth off, let him leaue: for they are a rebellious house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
