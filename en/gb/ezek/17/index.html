shall  he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by its roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, behold, [being] planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither,  when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these [things mean]? tell [them], Behold, the king of Babylon hath come to Jerusalem, and hath taken  its king, and its princes, and led them with him to Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken  an oath from him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That the kingdome might be in subiection, and not lift it selfe vp, but keepe their couenant, and stand to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he rebelled against him, and sent his ambassadours into Egypt, that they might giue him horses, and much people: shall hee prosper? shall he escape, that doeth such things? or shal he breake the couenant, and be deliuered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As I liue, saith the Lord God, he shall die in the middes of Babel, in the place of the King, that had made him King, whose othe he despised, and whose couenant made with him, he brake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither shall Pharaoh with his mightie hoste, and great multitude of people, mainteine him in the warre, when they haue cast vp mounts, and builded ramparts to destroy many persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given  his hand, and hath done all these [things], he shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, thus sayth the Lord God, As I liue, I wil surely bring mine othe that he hath despised, and my couenant that he hath broken vpon his owne head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I wil spread my net vpon him, & he shalbe taken in my net, & I wil bring him to Babel, and will enter into iudgement with him there for his trespas that he hath committed against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all that flee from him with all his hoste, shal fall by the sword, & they that remaine, shalbe scattered towarde all the windes: and ye shall know that I the Lord haue spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch  of the high cedar, and will set [it]; I will crop off from the  top of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant [it] upon an high mountain and eminent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a well favoured cedar: and under it shall dwell all  fowl of every wing; in the shadow of its branches shall they dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the  trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done [it].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
