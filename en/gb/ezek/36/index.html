Because the  enemy had said against you, Aha, even the ancient  high places are ours in possession:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made [you] desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession to the rest of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of  talkers, and [are] an infamy of the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore ye mountaines of Israel, heare the worde of the Lord God, Thus sayth the Lord God to the mountaines & to the hilles, to the riuers, and to the valleys, and to the waste, and desolate places, and to the cities that are forsaken: which are spoyled & had in derision of the residue of the heathen that are round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who have  appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all [their] heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the  shame of the nations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have  lifted up my hand, Surely the nations that [are] about you, they shall bear their shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall  shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are soon to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For behold, I come vnto you, & I wil turne vnto you, and ye shalbe tilled and sowen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I wil multiply the men vpon you, euen all the house of Israel wholly, & the cities shalbe inhabited, & the desolate places shalbe builded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you according to your old estates, and will do better [to you] than  at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, I will cause men to walk  upon you, [even] my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them [of men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say to you, Thou  [land] devourest men, and hast bereaved thy nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore thou shalt deuoure men no more, neither waste thy people henceforth, sayth the Lord God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither will I cause men to heare in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou beare the reproche of the people any more, neither shalt cause thy folke to fal any more, saith the Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreouer the word of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sonne of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their owne lande, they defiled it by their owne wayes, & by their deedes: their way was before me as the filthinesse of the menstruous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wherfore I powred my wrath vpon them, for the blood that they had shed in the land, and for their idoles, wherewith they had polluted it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries for according to their wayes, and according to their deedes, I iudged them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they entred vnto the heathen, whither they went, they polluted mine holy Name, when they sayd of them, These are the people of the Lord, and are gone out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I had pity for my holy  name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, to which they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not [this] for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my  holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the nations, to which ye went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I wil sanctifie my great Name, which was polluted among the heathen, among whome you haue polluted it, and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, sayth the Lorde God, when I shalbe sanctified in you before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your owne land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then will I sprinkle clean  water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A newe heart also will I giue you, and a new spirit wil I put within you, and I will take away the stonie heart out of your body, and I will giue you an heart of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will put my spirite within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, and ye shall keepe my iudgements and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And ye shall dwell in the land, that I gaue to your fathers, and ye shalbe my people, & I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the  grain, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For I will multiplie the fruite of the trees, & the increase of the fielde, that ye shal beare no more the reproch of famine among the heathen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that [were] not good, and shall  lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Be it knowen vnto you that I do not this for your sakes, sayth the Lord God: therefore, O ye house of Israel, be ashamed, and confounded for your owne wayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus sayth the Lord God, What time as I shall haue clensed you from all your iniquities, I will cause you to dwel in the cities, & the desolate places shalbe builded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the desolate land shalbe tilled, whereas it lay waste in the sight of all that passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For they sayd, This waste land was like the garden of Eden, and these waste & desolate and ruinous cities were strong, and were inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the nations that are left around you shall  know that I the LORD build the ruined [places, and] plant that which was desolate: I the LORD have spoken [it], and I will do [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be sought of ye house of Israel, to performe it vnto them: I wil encrease them with men like a flocke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As the holy flocke, as the flocke of Ierusalem in their solemne feastes, so shall the desolate cities be filled with flockes of men, and they shal know, that I am the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
