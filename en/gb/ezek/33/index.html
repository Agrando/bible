O ye house of Israel, I will iudge you euery one after his waies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our  captivity, in the tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, [that] one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the  hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, before he that had escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my  mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me, and saide,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying,  Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we [are] many; the land is given to us for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the  blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ye stand upon your  sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Say thus vnto them, Thus saieth the Lorde God, As I liue, so surely they that are in the desolate places, shall fall by the sword: and him that is in the open field, will I giue vnto the beasts to be deuoured: and they that be in the forts and in the caues, shall die of the pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I will lay the land desolate and waste, and the pompe of her strength shall cease: and the moutaines of Israel shalbe desolate, and none shall passe through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then shall they know that I am the Lord, when I haue laid ye land desolate & wast, because of al their abominations, that they haue committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are  talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they come to thee as the people come, and they sit before thee [as] my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they  show much love, [but] their heart goeth after their covetousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And loe, thou art vnto them, as a iesting song of one that hath a pleasant voyce, and can sing well: for they heare thy woordes, but they doe them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this commeth to passe (for loe, it will come) then shall they know, that a Prophet hath bene among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
