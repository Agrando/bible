behold, it is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The  morning is come upon thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble [is] near, and not the joyful  shouting upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I will shortly powre out my wrath vpon thee, and fulfil mine anger vpon thee: I will iudge thee according to thy wayes, and will lay vpon thee all thine abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Neither shall mine eie spare thee, neither will I haue pitie, but I will laye vpon thee according to thy wayes, and thine abominations shalbe in the middes of thee, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde that smiteth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the  rod hath blossomed,  pride hath budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence hath risen into a rod of wickedness: none of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither [shall there be] wailing for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer  rejoice, nor the seller  mourn: for wrath [is] upon all its multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not  return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the  vision [is] concerning its whole multitude, [which] shall not return;  neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath [is] upon all its multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is without, and the pestilence, and the famine within: he that is in the field, shall dye with the sword, and he that is in the citie, famine and pestilence shall deuoure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they that flee away from them, shall escape, and shalbe in the mountaines, like the doues of the valleis: all they shall mourne, euery one for his iniquitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All handes shalbe weake, and all knees shall fall away as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall also girde them selues with sackecloth, and feare shall couer them, and shame shalbe vpon all faces, & baldnes vpon their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall cast their siluer in the streetes, and their golde shalbe cast farre off: their siluer and their gold can not deliuer them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfie their soules, neither fill their bowels: for this ruine is for their iniquitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for the beauty of his  ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations [and] of their detestable things in it: therefore have I set it far from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it into the hands of the  strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my  secret [place]: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make a  chain: for the land is full of  bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease;
