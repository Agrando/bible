[Is this] of thy harlotries a small matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That thou hast slaine my children, and deliuered them to cause them to passe through fire for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all thine abominations and whoredomes thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And beside all thy wickednes (wo, wo vnto thee, saith the Lord God)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou hast also built vnto thee an hie place, and hast made thee an hie place in euery streete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou hast built thine hie place at euery corner of the way, and hast made thy beautie to be abhorred: thou hast opened thy feete to euery one that passed by, & multiplied thy whoredome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou hast also committed harlotry with the  Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy harlotry, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Beholde, therefore I did stretche out mine hand ouer thee, and will diminish thine ordinarie, and deliuer thee vnto the will of them that hate thee, euen to the daughters of the Philistims, which are ashamed of thy wicked way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insaciable: yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thou hast moreouer multiplied thy fornication from the land of Canaan vnto Caldea, and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Howe weake is thine heart, saith the Lorde God, seeing thou doest all these thinges, euen the worke of a presumptuous whorish woman?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that thou buildest thy eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot,  in that thou scornest hire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But as a wife that playeth the harlot, and taketh others for her husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They giue giftes to all other whores, but thou giuest giftes vnto all thy louers, and rewardest them, that they may come vnto thee on euery side for thy fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy fornications, neither the like fornication shall be after thee: for in that thou giuest a rewarde, and no reward is giuen vnto thee, therefore thou art contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Wherefore, O harlot, heare the worde of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus sayeth the Lorde God, Because thy shame was powred out, and thy filthinesse discouered through thy fornications with thy louers, and with all the idoles of thine abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didest offer vnto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, therefore I will gather all  thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all [them] that thou hast loved, with all [them] that thou hast hated; I will even gather them on every side against thee, and will uncover thy nakedness to them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will judge thee, as women that  break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I will also giue thee into their handes, and they shal destroy thine hie place, and shall breake downe thine hie places. They shall strippe thee also out of thy clothes, and shall take thy faire iewels, and leaue thee naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall also bring vp a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swordes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they shall burne vp thine houses with fire, and execute iudgements vpon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt giue no reward any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my  jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these [things]; behold, therefore I also will  recompense thy way upon [thy] head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thy abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use [this] proverb against thee, saying, As [is] the mother,  [so is] her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou [art] thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou [art] the sister of thy  sisters, who lothed their husbands and their children: your mother [was] an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And thy elder sister [is] Samaria, she and her  daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, [is] Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet hast thou  not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as [if that were] a very little [thing], thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I liue, saith the Lorde God, Sodom thy sister hath not done, neither shee nor her daughters, as thou hast done and thy daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom,  pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But they were hautie, and committed abomination before mee: therefore I tooke them away, as pleased me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Neither  hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thy abominations more than they, and hast  justified thy sisters in all thy abominations which thou hast done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Therefore thou which hast iustified thy sisters, beare thine owne shame for thy sinnes, that thou hast committed more abominable then they which are more righteous then thou art: be thou therefore confounded also, and beare thy shame, seeing that thou hast iustified thy sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I shall bring again  their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then [will I bring again] the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>That thou mayest bear thy own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a  comfort to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state,  then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned  by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Before thy wickedness was  uncovered, as at the time of [thy] reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all [that are] around  her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise thee on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thou hast borne therefore thy wickednesse and thine abomination, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the  oath in breaking the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Nevertheless I will  remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish to thee an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive  thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger: and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not  by thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And I wil establish my couenant with thee, and thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>That thou mayest remember, and be  confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
