And when he had spoken unto me, I  was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the  prince of Grecia shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth:  and [there is] none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
