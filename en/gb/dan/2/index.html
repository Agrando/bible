So they came and stood before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the King sayde vnto them, I haue dreamed a dreame, and my spirite was troubled to knowe the dreame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in  Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye  shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if yee declare the dreame and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receyue of me gifts and rewardes, and great honour: therefore shewe me the dreame and the interpretation of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They answered again and said, Let the king tell  his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the King answered, and sayd, I knowe certeinly that ye would gaine the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if ye will not declare mee the dreame, there is but one iudgement for you: for ye haue prepared lying and corrupt wordes, to speake before me till the time bee changed: therefore tell me the dreame, that I may knowe, if yee can declare me the interpretation thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the Caldeans answered before the King, and sayde, There is no man vpon earth that can declare the Kings matter: yea, there is neither king nor prince nor lorde that asked such things at an inchanter or astrologian or Caldean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is a rare thing that the King requireth, and there is none other that can declare it before the King, except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this cause the king was angrie and in great furie, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the decree went forth that the wise [men] should be slain; and they  sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisedome to Arioch the Kings chiefe stewarde, which was gone foorth to put to death the wise men of Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yea, he answered and sayde vnto Arioch the kings captaine, Why is the sentence so hastie from the king? Then Arioch declared the thing to Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Daniel went and desired the king that he woulde giue him leasure and that he woulde shewe the king the interpretation thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Daniel went to his house & shewed the matter to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah his companions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That they should beseech the God of heauen for grace in this secrete, that Daniel and his fellowes should not perish with the rest of ye wise men of Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then was the secret reueiled vnto Daniel in a vision by night: therefore Daniel praysed the God of heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Daniel answered and sayde, The Name of God be praysed for euer and euer: for wisedome and strength are his,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And hee changeth the times & seasons: he taketh away kings: he setteth vp kings: he giueth wisedome vnto the wise, and vnderstanding to those that vnderstand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what [is] in the darkness, and the  light dwelleth with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my  fathers, who hast given me wisdom and  might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast [now] made known unto us the king's matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise [men] of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not  the wise [men] of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Arioch brought Daniel before the King in all haste, and sayd thus vnto him, I haue found a man of the children of Iudah that were brought captiues, that will declare vnto the King the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then answered the King, and sayde vnto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to shew me the dreame, which I haue seene, and the interpretation thereof?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Daniel answered in the presence of the King, and sayd, The secret which the King hath demanded, can neither the wise, the astrologians, the inchanters, nor the southsayers declare vnto the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But there is a God in  heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O King, when thou wast in thy bedde, thoughts came into thy mind, what should come to passe hereafter, and he that reueyleth secretes, telleth thee, what shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as  for me, this secret is not revealed to me for [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but for [their] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O King, thou sawest, and beholde, there was a great image: this great image whose glory was so excellent, stood before thee, & the forme thereof was terrible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This image's head [was] of fine  gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>His legges of yron, and his feete were part of yron, and part of clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Thou beheldest it til a stone was cut without hands, which smote the image vpon his feete, that were of yron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then was the yron, the clay, the brasse, the siluer and the golde broken all together, and became like the chaffe of the sommer floures, and the winde caryed them away, that no place was founde for them: and the stone that smote the image, became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>This is the dreame, and we will declare before the King the interpretation thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>O King, thou art a king of Kings: for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a kingdome, power, and strength, and glorie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou [art]  this head of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And after thee shall arise another kingdom  inferior to thee, and another  third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all [things]: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in  pieces and bruise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be  divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as the toes of the feete were parte of yron, and parte of clay, so shall the kingdome be partly strong, and partly broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with  the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which  shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, [but] it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the  stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream [is] certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and  worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth [it is], that your  God [is] a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great  gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise [men] of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then Daniel  requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel [sat] in the  gate of the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
