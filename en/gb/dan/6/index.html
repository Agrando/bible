The King answered, and sayd, The thing is true, according to the Lawe of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then answered they, and sayd vnto the King, This Daniel which is of the children of the captiuitie of Iudah, regardeth not thee, O King, nor the decree, that thou hast sealed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the King heard these wordes, hee was sore displeased with himselfe, and set his heart on Daniel, to deliuer him: and he laboured till the sunne went downe, to deliuer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians [is], That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be  changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the King commaunded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the denne of lyons: now the King spake, and said vnto Daniel, Thy God, whome thou alway seruest, euen he will deliuer thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a stone was brought, and layed vpon the mouth of the denne, and the King sealed it with his owne signet, and with the signet of his princes, that the purpose might not be changed, concerning Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the King went vnto his palace, and remained fasting, neither were the instruments of musike brought before him, and his sleepe went from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the King arose early in the morning, & went in all haste vnto the denne of lyons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: [and] the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually,  able to deliver thee from the lions?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then saide Daniel vnto the King, O King, liue for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him  innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done  no hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he  believed in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they  cast [them] into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Afterwarde King Darius wrote, Vnto all people, nations and languages, that dwel in all the world: Peace be multiplied vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear  before the God of Daniel: for he [is] the  living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion [shall be even] unto the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Hee rescueth and deliuereth, and hee worketh signes and wonders in heauen and in earth, who hath deliuered Daniel from the power of the lyons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So this Daniel prospered in the reigne of Darius and in the reigne of Cyrus of Persia.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
