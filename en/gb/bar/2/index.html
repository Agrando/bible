our God hath perfourmed his woorde, which hee pronounced against vs, and against our iudges that gouerned Israel, and against our Kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Iuda,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 To bring vpon vs great plagues, such as neuer came to passe vnder the whole heauen, as they that were done in Ierusalem, according to things, that were written in the Lawe of Moises,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 That some among vs should eat ye flesh of his owne sonne, & some the flesh of his owne daughter.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 Moreouer, hee hath deliuered them to be in subiection to all the kingdomes, that are rounde about vs, to bee as a reproche and desolation among all the people rounde about where the Lorde hath scattered them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 Thus they are brought beneath and not aboue, because we haue sinned against the Lorde our God, and haue not heard his voyce.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 To the Lord our God apperteineth righteousnes, but vnto vs and to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 For all these plagues are come vpon vs, which the Lord hath pronounced against vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 Yet haue we not praied before the Lord, that we might turne euery one from the imaginations of his owne wicked heart.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 So the Lord hath watched ouer the plagues, and the Lorde hath brought them vpon vs: for the Lord is righteous in all his woorkes, which he hath commanded vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 Yet wee haue not hearkened vnto his voyce, to walke in the commandements of the Lorde that he hath giuen vnto vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 And nowe, O Lord God of Israel, that hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mightie hand, and an hie arme, and with signes, and with wonders, and with great power, and hast gotten thy selfe a Name, as appeareth this day,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 O Lorde our God, we haue sinned: we haue done wickedly: we haue offended in all thine ordinances.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 Let thy wrath turne from vs: for we are but a fewe left among the heathen, where thou hast scattered vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 Heare our praiers, O Lorde, and our peticions, and deliuer vs for thine owne sake, and giue vs fauor in the sight of them, which haue led vs away,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 That all the earth may knowe that thou art the Lord our God, and that thy Name is called vpon Israel and vpon their posteritie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 Therefore looke downe fro thine holy Temple, and thinke vpon vs: encline thine eare, O Lord, and heare vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 Open thine eyes, and beholde: for the dead that are in the graues, and whose soules are out of their bodies, giue vnto the Lorde neither praise, nor righteousnesse.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 But the soule that is vexed for the greatnesse of sinne, and hee that goeth crookedly, and weake, and the eyes that faile, and the hungrie soule will giue thee praise and righteousnesse, O Lord.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 For wee doe not require mercie in thy sight, O Lorde our God, for the righteousnesse of our fathers, or of our Kings,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 But because thou hast sent out thy wrath andindignation vpon vs, as thou hast spoken by thy seruants the Prophets, saying,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 Thus sayth the Lorde, Bowe downe your shoulders, and serue the King of Babylon: so shal ye remaine in the land, that I gaue vnto your fathers.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>{\cf2 But if ye will not heare the voyce of ye Lord, to serue the King of Babylon,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 I will cause to cease in the cities of Iuda, and in Ierusalem, I wil cause to cease the voyce of mirth, and the voyce of ioye, and the voyce of the bridegrome, and the voyce of the bride, and the land shal be desolate of inhabitants.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>{\cf2 But we woulde not hearken vnto thy voyce, to serue the King of Babylon: therefore hast thou performed the wordes that thou spakest by thy seruants the Prophets: namely, that the bones of our Kings, and the bones of our fathers should be caried out of their places.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>{\cf2 And lo, they are cast out to the heate of the day, and to the colde of the night, and are dead in great miserie with famine, and with the sworde, and in banishment.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>{\cf2 And the Temple wherein thy Name was called vpon, thou hast brought to ye state, as appeareth this day, for the wickednesse of the house of Israel, and the house of Iuda.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>{\cf2 O Lorde our God, thou hast intreated vs according to equitie, and according to all thy great mercie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 As thou spakest by thy seruant Moyses, in the day when thou diddest commande him to write thy Lawe before the children of Israel, saying,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 If ye will not obey my voyce, then shall this great swarme and multitude be turned into a verie fewe among the nations where I will scatter them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 For I know that they will not heare me: for it is a stifnecked people: but in the lande of their captiuitie they shall remember themselues,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 And knowe that I am the Lorde their God: then wil I giue them an heart to vnderstand, & eares.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 And they shall heare, & prayse me in the land of their captiuitie, and thinke vpon my Name.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>{\cf2 Then shall they turne them from their hard backes, and from their euill workes: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>{\cf2 And I will bring them againe into the land, which I promised with an othe vnto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, and they shalbe Lordes of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>{\cf2 And I will make an euerlasting couenant with them, that I will be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more driue my people of Israel out of the land that I haue giuen them.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
