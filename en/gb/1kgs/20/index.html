Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And [Benhadad] said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in  Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then [said Ahab], I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD,  Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall  slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he founde another man, and sayde, Smite mee, I pray thee; the man smote him, and in smiting wounded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So the Prophet departed, & wayted for the King by the way, & disguised himselfe with ashes vpon his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,  Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And as thy seruant had here and there to do, he was gone: And the King of Israel said vnto him, So shall thy iudgement be: thou hast giuen sentence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And hee hasted, and tooke the ashes away from his face: and the King of Israel knewe him that he was of the Prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast let goe out of thine handes a man whom I appoynted to dye, thy life shall goe for his life, and thy people for his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the King of Israel went to his house heauie and in displeasure, & came to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
