And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The altar also claue asunder, and the ashes fell out from the altar, according to the signe, which the man of God had giuen by the commandement of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king answered and said unto the man of God,  Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as [it was] before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the King sayde vnto the man of God, Come home with mee, that thou mayest dyne, and I will giue thee a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the man of God saide vnto the King, If thou wouldest giue me halfe thine house, I would not goe in with thee, neither woulde I eate bread nor drinke water in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying,  Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And an olde Prophet dwelt in Beth-el, and his sonnes came and tolde him all ye woorkes, that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el, and the wordes which he had spoken vnto the King, tolde they their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their father sayde vnto them, What way went he? and his sonnes shewed him what waye the man of God went, which came from Iudah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And hee saide vnto his sonnes, Saddle mee the asse.

And he sayd, Yea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said unto him,  Come home with me, and eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he answered, I may not returne with thee, nor go in with thee, neither wil I eate bread nor drinke water with thee in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it was charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Thou shalt eate no bread, nor drinke water there, nor turne againe to goe by the way that thou wentest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said unto him, I [am] a prophet also as thou [art]; and an  angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. [But] he lied unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he went againe with him, and did eate bread in his house, and dranke water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as they sate at the table, the worde of the Lorde came vnto the Prophet, that brought him againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD,  Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But camest backe againe, and hast eaten bread and drunke water in the place (whereof he did say vnto thee, Thou shalt eate no bread nor drinke any water) thy carkeis shall not come vnto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he had eaten bread & drunke, he sadled him the asse, to wit, to the Prophet whome he had brought againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he was gone,  a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And beholde, men that passed by, sawe the carkeis cast in the way, and the lion standing by the corps: and they came and tolde it in ye towne where the olde Prophet dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the Prophet that brought him backe againe from the waye, hearde thereof, hee sayde, It is the man of God, who hath bene disobedient vnto the commandement of the Lorde: therefore the Lorde hath deliuered him vnto the lion, which hath rent him and slayne him, according to the worde of the Lorde, which hee spake vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he spake to his sonnes, saying, Saddle me the asse; they sadled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had  not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Prophet tooke vp the body of the man of God, & layed it vpon the asse, & brought it againe, and the olde Prophet came to the citie, to lament and burie him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he laid his carcase in his  own grave; and they mourned over him, [saying], Alas, my brother!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when he had buried him, hee spake to his sonnes, saying, When I am dead, burie ye mee also in the sepulchre, wherein the man of God is buried: lay my bones beside his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For that thing which he cried by the word of the Lorde against the altar that is in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the hie places, which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to passe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After this thing Jeroboam  returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became [one] of the priests of the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this thing turned to sinne vnto the house of Ieroboam, euen to roote it out, and destroy it from the face of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
