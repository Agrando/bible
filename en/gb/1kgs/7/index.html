Also Salomon made an house for Pharaohs daughter ( whom he had taken to wife) like vnto this porche.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All these [were of] costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto  the coping, and [so] on the outside toward the great court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the foundation was of costly stones, and great stones, euen of stones of ten cubites, and stones of eight cubites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And  above [were] costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the great court round about [was] with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams,  both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then King Salomon sent, and set one Hiram out of Tyrus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He [was] a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and  he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he cast two pillars of brasse: ye height of a pillar was eighteene cubites, and a threede of twelue cubites did compasse either of ye pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he made two chapiters of molten brasse to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of one of the chapiters was fiue cubites, and the height of the other chapiter was fiue cubites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He made grates like networke, and wrethen worke like chaynes for the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars, euen seuen for the one chapiter, and seuen for the other chapiter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he made the pillars and two rowes of pomegranates round about in the one grate to couer the chapiters that were vpon the top; thus did he for the other chapiter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chapiters that [were] upon the top of the pillars [were] of  lily work in the porch, four cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the chapiters vpon the two pillars had also aboue, ouer against the belly within the networke pomegranates: for two hudreth pomegranates were in the two rankes about vpon either of the chapiters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he set up the pillars in the  porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof  Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof  Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And vpon the top of the pillars was worke of lilyes: so was the workemanship of the pillars finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he made a molten  sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: [it was] round all about, and his height [was] five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And vnder the brimme of it were knoppes like wilde cucumers compassing it round about, ten in one cubite, compassing the sea round about: and the two rowes of knoppes were cast, when it was molten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It stoode on twelue bulles, three looking towarde the North, and three toward the West, and three toward the South, and three towarde the East: and the sea stoode aboue vpon them, and all their hinder partes were inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it [was] an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand  baths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he made tenne bases of brasse, one base was foure cubites long, and foure cubites broad, and three cubites hie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the worke of the bases was on this maner, They had borders, and the borders were betweene the ledges:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And on the borders that were betweene the ledges, were lyons, bulles and Cherubims: and vpon the ledges there was a base aboue: and beneath the lyons and bulles, were addicions made of thinne worke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And euery base had foure brasen wheeles, and plates of brasse: and the foure corners had vndersetters: vnder the caldron were vndersetters molten at the side of euery addicion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the  mouth of it within the chapiter and above [was] a cubit: but the mouth thereof [was] round [after] the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it [were] gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And vnder the borders were foure wheeles, and the axeltrees of the wheeles ioyned to the base: and the height of a wheele was a cubite and halfe a cubite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the facion of the wheeles was like the facion of a charet wheele, their axeltrees, and their naues and their felloes, and their spokes were all molten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And foure vndersetters were vpon the foure corners of one base: and the vndersetters thereof were of the base it selfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the top of the base [was there] a round  compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof [were] of the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And vpon the tables of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof he did graue Cherubims, lions and palmetrees, on the side of euery one, and addicions round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus made he the tenne bases, They had all one casting, one measure, and one syse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then made he  ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: [and] every laver was four cubits: [and] upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the  house eastward over against the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Hiram made caldrons, and besomes, & basens, & Hiram finished all the worke that he made to King Salomon for the house of ye Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>To wit, two pillars and two bowles of the chapiters that were on the toppe of the two pillars, and two grates to couer the two bowles of the chapiters which were vpon the toppe of the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And foure hundreth pomegranates for the two grates, euen two rowes of pomegranates for euery grate to couer the two bowles of the chapiters, that were vpon the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the ten bases, and ten caldrons vpon the bases,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the sea, and twelue bulles vnder that sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which  Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, [were of] bright brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In the plaine of Iorden did the King cast them in clay betweene Succoth and Zarthan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Salomon left to weigh all the vessels because of the exceeding aboundance, neyther could the weight of the brasse be counted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Solomon made all the vessels that [pertained] unto the house of the LORD: the  altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread [was],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the candlestickes, fiue at the right side, and fiue at the left, before the oracle of pure gold, and the flowres, and the lampes, and the snuffers of golde,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the bowls,  and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers [of] pure gold; and the hinges [of] gold, [both] for the doors of the inner house, the most holy [place, and] for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So was finished all the worke that King Salomon made for the house of the Lorde, and Salomon brought in the things which Dauid his father had dedicated: the siluer and the golde and the vessels, and layed them among the treasures of the house of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
