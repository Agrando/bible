[but] will give one  tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he [was] of the king's  seed in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the  slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(For six moneths did Ioab remaine there, and all Israel, till he had destroyed all the males in Edom)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That Hadad  fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad [being] yet a little child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran, and tooke men with them out of Paran, and came to Egypt vnto Pharaoh King of Egypt, which gaue him an house, and appointed him vitailes, and gaue him lande.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hadad  found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his sonne, whome Tahpenes wayned in Pharaohs house: and Genubath was in Pharaohs house among the sonnes of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Hadad heard in Egypt, that Dauid slept with his fathers, and that Ioab the captaine of the hoste was dead, Hadad sayde to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may goe to mine owne countrey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Pharaoh saide vnto him, What hast thou lacked with me, that thou wouldest thus go to thine owne countrey? And he answered, Nothing, but in any wise let me goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which  fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein,  and reigned in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore was he an aduersarie to Israel all the daies of Salomon: besides the euil that Hadad did, he also abhorred Israel, & reigned ouer Aram</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat an Ephrathite of Zereda Salomons seruant (whose mother was called Zeruah a widowe) lift vp his hand against the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this was the cause that he lift vp his hande against the King, When Salomon built Millo, he repared the broken places of the citie of Dauid his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the man Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him  ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And at that time, when Ieroboam went out of Ierusalem, the Prophet Ahiiah the Shilonite founde him in the way, hauing a newe garment on him, and they two were alone in ye field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahijah caught the new garment that [was] on him, and  rent it [in] twelve pieces:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And said to Ieroboam, Take vnto thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lorde God of Israel, Beholde, I wil rent the kingdome out of ye hands of Salomon, and will giue ten tribes to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he shall haue one tribe for my seruant Dauids sake, and for Ierusalem the citie, which I haue chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because they haue forsaken me, and haue worshipped Ashtaroth the god of the Zidonians, and Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and haue not walked in my wayes (to do right in mine eyes, & my statutes, & my lawes) as did Dauid his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I will not take the whole kingdome out of his hande: for I will make him prince all his life long for Dauid my seruants sake, whome I haue chosen, and who kept my commandements and my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But I will take the kingdome out of his sonnes hand, and will giue it vnto thee, euen the ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a  light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I wil take thee, and thou shalt reigne, euen as thine heart desireth, and shalt be King ouer Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if thou hearken vnto all that I commande thee, and wilt walke in my wayes, and doe right in my sight, to keepe my statutes and my commandements, as Dauid my seruant did, then will I be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built vnto Dauid, and wil giue Israel vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will  for this afflict the seed of David,  but not for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Salomon sought therefore to kill Ieroboam, and Ieroboam arose, and fled into Egypt vnto Shishak King of Egypt, and was in Egypt vntil the death of Salomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, [are] they not written in the  book of the acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The time that Salomon reigned in Ierusalem ouer all Israel, was fourtie yeere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Salomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the citie of Dauid his father: and Rehoboam his sonne reigned in his steade.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
