So Israel departed unto their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Howbeit ouer the children of Israel, which dwelt in the cities of Iudah, did Rehoboam reigne still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Nowe the King Rehoboam sent Adoram the receiuer of the tribute, and all Israel stoned him to death: then King Rehoboam made speede to get him vp to his charet, to flee to Ierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Israel rebelled against the house  of David unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when all Israel had heard that Ieroboam was come againe, they sent and called him vnto the assemblie, and made him King ouer all Israel: none followed the house of Dauid, but the tribe of Iudah onely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he  assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the  man of God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speake vnto Rehoboam the sonne of Salomon King of Iudah, and vnto all the house of Iudah and Beniamin, and the remnant of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus saith the  LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Ieroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein, and went fro thence, and built Penuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ieroboam thought in his heart, Nowe shall the kingdome returne to the house of Dauid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD  at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, [even] unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves [of] gold, and said unto them,  It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other set he in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this thing turned to sinne: for the people went (because of the one) euen to Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he made an  house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the  fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that [is] in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he offered vpon the altar, which he had made in Beth-el, the fifteenth day of the eight moneth, (euen in the moneth which he had forged of his owne heart) and made a solemne feast vnto the children of Israel: and he went vp to the altar, to burne incense.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
