the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might  bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which [is] Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month  Ethanim, which [is] the seventh month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the Elders of Israel came and the Priests tooke the Arke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They bare the Arke of the Lorde, and they bare the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle: those did the Priestes and Leuites bring vp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And King Salomon and all the Congregation of Israel, that were assembled vnto him, were with him before the Arke, offering sheepe and beeues, which could not be tolde, nor nombred for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the  priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy [place, even] under the wings of the cherubims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For ye Cherubims stretched out their wings ouer the place of the Arke, and the Cherubims couered the Arke, and the barres thereof aboue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they  drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy [place] before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[There was] nothing in the ark  save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made [a covenant] with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when the Priestes were come out of the Sanctuarie, the cloude filled the house of the Lorde,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So that the Priestes could not stande to minister, because of the cloude: for the glorie of the Lorde had filled the house of the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then spake Salomon, The Lord said, that he woulde dwell in the darke cloude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for  ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the King turned his face, and blessed all the Congregation of Israel: for all the Congregation of Israel stoode there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his mouth vnto Dauid my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no citie of all the tribes of Israel, to builde an house that my name might be there: but I haue chosen Dauid to be ouer my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was in ye heart of Dauid my father to builde an house to the Name of the Lorde God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Lord said vnto Dauid my father, Where as it was in thine heart to build an house vnto my Name, thou diddest well, that thou wast so minded:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Neuerthelesse thou shalt not builde the house, but thy sonne that shall come out of thy loynes, he shall builde the house vnto my Name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lorde hath made good his worde that he spake: and I am risen vp in the roume of Dauid my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and haue built the house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein [is] the  covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Salomon stoode before the altar of the Lorde in the sight of all the Congregation of Israel, and stretched out his handes towarde heauen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, LORD God of Israel, [there is] no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with  all their heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou that hast kept with thy seruant Dauid my father, that thou hast promised him: for thou spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hande, as appeareth this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keepe with thy seruant Dauid my father that thou hast promised him, saying, Thou shalt not want a man in my sight to sit vpon ye throne of Israel: so that thy childre take heed to their way, that they walke before me; as thou hast walked in my sight</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And nowe, O God of Israel, I pray thee, let thy worde be verified, which thou spakest vnto thy seruant Dauid my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But haue thou respect vnto the prayer of thy seruant, and to his supplication, O Lorde, my God, to heare the cry and prayer which thy seruant prayeth before thee this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That thine eyes may be open toward this house, night and day, euen towarde the place whereof thou hast said, My Name shalbe there: that thou mayest hearken vnto the prayer which thy seruant prayeth in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Heare thou therefore the supplication of thy seruant, and of thy people Israel, which pray in this place, & heare thou in the place of thine habitation, euen in heauen, and when thou hearest, haue mercie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If any man trespass against his neighbour,  and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then hear thou in heaven, and  do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and  confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then heare thou in heauen, and be mercifull vnto the sinne of thy people Israel, and bring them againe vnto the lande, which thou gauest vnto their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When heaven is  shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then heare thou in heauen, and pardon the sinne of thy seruants and of thy people Israel (when thou hast taught the the good way wherein they may walke) and giue raine vpon the land that thou hast giuen to thy people to inherite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When there shalbe famine in the land, when there shalbe pestilence, when there shall be blasting, mildewe, grashopper or caterpiller, when their enemie shall besiege them in the cities of their lande, or any plague, or any sickenesse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>What prayer and supplication soever be [made] by any man, [or] by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own  heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Heare thou then in heauen, in thy dwelling place, and be mercifull, and doe, and giue euery man according to all his wayes, as thou knowest his heart, (for thou only knowest the heartes of all the children of men)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That they may feare thee as long as they liue in ye lad, which thou gauest vnto our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Moreover concerning a  stranger, that [is] not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>(When they shal heare of thy great name, and of thy mightie hande, and of thy stretched out arme) and shall come and pray in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as [do] thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy  name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>When thy people shall go out to battell against their enemie by the way that thou shalt sende them, and shall pray vnto the Lorde towarde the way of the citie which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I haue built for thy Name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Heare thou then in heauen their prayer & their supplication, and iudge their cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>If they sinne against thee, ( for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou be angry with them, and deliuer them vnto the enemies, so that they cary them away prisoners vnto the land of the enemies, either farre or neere,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>[Yet] if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee  in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And [so] return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward  their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then heare thou their prayer and their supplication in heauen thy dwelling place, and iudge their cause,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may  have compassion on them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out of Egypt from the middes of the yron fornace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Let thine eyes be open vnto the prayer of thy seruant, and vnto the prayer of thy people Israel, to hearken vnto them, in all that they call for vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For thou diddest separate them to thee from among all people of the earth for an inheritance, as thou saidest by the hand of Moses thy seruant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And it was [so], that when Solomon had made an  end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And stoode and blessed all the Congregation of Israel with a loud voyce, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Blessed be the Lorde that hath giuen rest vnto his people Israel, according to all that hee promised: there hath not fayled one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses his seruant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Lorde our God be with vs, as he was with our fathers, that he forsake vs not, neither leaue vs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>That he may  incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And these my wordes, which I haue prayed before the Lorde, be neere vnto the Lorde our God day and night, that he defende the cause of his seruant, and the cause of his people Israel alway as the matter requireth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>That all the people of ye earth may knowe, that the Lord is God, and none other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Let your heart therefore be perfit with the Lorde our God to walke in his statutes, and to keepe his commandements, as this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then the King and all Israel with him offred sacrifice before the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the  house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>The same day did the King halowe the middle of the court, that was before the house of the Lorde: for there he made burnt offerings, and the meate offrings, and the fat of the peace offeringes, because the brasen altar that was before the Lorde, was too litle to receiue the burnt offerings, and the meate offerings, and the fat of the peace offrings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of  Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God,  seven days and seven days, [even] fourteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And the eight day he sent the people away: and they thanked the King and went vnto their tentes ioyous and with glad heart, because of al the goodnesse that the Lord had done for Dauid his seruant, and for Israel his people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
