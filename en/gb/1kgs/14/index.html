for I [am] sent to thee [with] heavy [tidings].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted  thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And haue rent the kingdome away from the house of Dauid, and haue giuen it thee, and thou hast not bene as my seruant Dauid, which kept my commaundements, and followed mee with all his heart, and did onely that which was right in mine eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and  molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that  pisseth against the wall, [and] him that  is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:  for the LORD hath spoken [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Vp therefore and get thee to thine house: for when thy feete enter into the citie, the childe shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found  [some] good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day:  but what? even now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the  river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who  made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Ieroboams wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah, and when shee came to the threshold of the house, the yong man dyed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they buried him, and all Israel lamented him; according to the word of the Lord, which hee spake by the hand of his seruant Ahiiah the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of Ieroboams actes, how hee warred, and howe hee reigned, beholde, they are written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the days which Jeroboam reigned [were] two and twenty years: and he  slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.
