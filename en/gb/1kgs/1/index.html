And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the people came vp after him, and the people piped with pipes, and reioyced with great ioye, so that the earth rang with the sound of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Adoniiah and all the ghestes that were with him, heard it: (and they had made an ende of eating) and when Ioab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, What meaneth this noise and vprore in the citie?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou [art] a valiant man, and bringest  good tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Ionathan answered, and said to Adoniiah, Verely our lord King Dauid hath made Salomon King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the King hath sent with him Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they haue caused him to ride vpon the Kings mule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Zadok the Priest, and Nathan ye Prophet haue anointed him King in Gihon: and they are gone vp from thence with ioy, and the citie is moued: this is the noise that ye haue heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Salomon also sitteth on the throne of the kingdome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the  bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And thus sayd the King also, Blessed bee the Lorde God of Israel, who hath made one to sit on my throne this day, euen in my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then all the ghestes that were with Adonijah, were afraide, and rose vp, and went euery man his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the  altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And one tolde Salomon, saying, Beholde, Adonijah doeth feare King Salomon: for lo, he hath caught holde on the hornes of the altar, saying, Let King Salomon sweare vnto me this day, that he will not slay his seruant with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Salomon sayd, If he will shewe him selfe a worthy man, there shall not an heare of him fall to the earth, but if wickednes be found in him, he shall dye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then King Salomon sent, & they brought him from the altar, and he came and did obeisance vnto King Salomon; Salomon sayde vnto him, Go to thine house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
