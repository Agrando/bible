(Now Obadiah  feared the LORD greatly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For when Iezebel destroyed the Prophets of the Lorde, Obadiah tooke an hundreth Prophets, and hid them, by fiftie in a caue, and he fed them with bread and water.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Ahab saide vnto Obadiah, Goe into the land, vnto all the fountaines of water, and vnto all the riuers, if so be that we may finde grasse to saue the horses and the mules aliue, lest we depriue the lande of the beastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And so they deuided the lande betweene them to walke thorowe it. Ahab went one way by him selfe, and Obadiah went another way by him selfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah  met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, [Art] thou that my lord Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he answered him, Yea, goe tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, What haue I sinned, that thou wouldest deliuer thy seruant into the hande of Ahab, to slay me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As the Lorde thy God liueth, there is no nation or kingdome, whither my lorde hath not sent to seeke thee: and when they sayd, He is not here, he tooke an othe of the kingdome and nation, if they had not found thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now thou sayest, Goe, tell thy lorde, Beholde, Eliiah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, [as soon as] I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and [so] when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant  fear the LORD from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Was it not tolde my lord, what I did when Iezebel slew the Prophets of the Lord, how I hid an hundreth men of the Lordes Prophets by fifties in a caue, and fed them with bread & water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now thou sayest, Go, tel thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here, that he may slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Elijah said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew  myself unto him to day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Obadiah went to meete Ahab, and tolde him: And Ahab went to meete Eliiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Ahab saw Eliiah, Ahab said vnto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but  thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel vnto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal foure hundreth and fiftie, and the prophets of the groues foure hundreth, which eate at Iezebels table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Ahab sent vnto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together vnto mount Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long  halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD [be] God, follow him: but if Baal, [then] follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said Eliiah vnto the people, I onely remayne a Prophet of the Lorde: but Baals prophets are foure hundreth and fiftie men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let them therefore giue vs two bullockes, and let them chuse the one, & cut him in pieces, and lay him on the wood, but put no fire vnder, and I will prepare the other bullocke, and lay him on the wood, and will put no fire vnder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth  by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Eliiah said vnto the prophets of Baal, Chuse you a bullocke, and prepare him first, (for ye are many) and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire vnder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed [it], and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But [there was] no voice, nor any that answered. And they  leaped upon the altar which was made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he [is] a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, [or] peradventure he sleepeth, and must be  awaked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they cryed loude, and cut them selues as their maner was, with kniues and launcers, till the blood gushed out vpon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when midday was passed, & they had prophecied vntil the offring of the euening sacrifice, there was neither voyce, nor one to answere, nor any that regarded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Eliiah said vnto all the people, Come to me; all the people came to him; he repayred the altar of the Lorde that was broken downe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Eliiah tooke twelue stones, according to the nomber of the tribes of the sonnes of Iaakob, (vnto whome the worde of the Lord came, saying, Israel shalbe thy name)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And with the stones he buylt an altar in the Name of the Lorde: and he made a ditch round about the altar, as great as woulde conteine two measures of seede.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he put the wood in order, and hewed the bullocke in pieces, & layd him on the wood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And said, Fill foure barrels with water, and powre it on the burnt offring and on the wood. Againe he said, Doe so againe; they did so the second time; he sayde, Doe it the third time; they did it the third time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the water ran round about the altar; and he  filled the trench also with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when they should offer the euening sacrifice, Eliiah the Prophet came, and sayd, Lord God of Abraham, Izhak and of Israel, let it be knowen this day, that thou art the God of Israel, and that I am thy seruant, and that I haue done all these things at thy commandement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou [art] the LORD God, and [that] thou hast turned their heart back  again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt offring, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked vp the water that was in the ditche.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when all the people sawe it, they fell on their faces, and saide, The Lord is God, the Lord is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not  one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Eliiah sayde vnto Ahab, Get thee vp, eate and drinke, for there is a sound of much rayne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So Ahab went vp to eate and to drinke, and Eliiah went vp to the top of Carmel: and he crouched vnto the earth, & put his face betweene his knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, [There is] nothing. And he said, Go again  seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And at the seuenth time he sayd, Behold, there ariseth a litle cloude out of the sea like a mans hand. Then he sayd, Vp, and say vnto Ahab, Make readie thy charet, and get thee downe, that the raine stay thee not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And in the meane while the heauen was blacke with cloudes and winde, and there was a great rayne. Then Ahab went vp and came to Izreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran  before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
