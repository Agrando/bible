And he laid him down  upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Iezebel his wife came to him & said vnto him, Why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said vnto her, Because I spake vnto Naboth the Izreelite, & sayd vnto him, Giue me thy vineyard for money, or if it please thee, I will giue thee another vineyard for it: but he answered, I wil not giue thee my vineyarde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jezebel his wife said unto him,  Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, [and] eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So she wrote letters in Ahabs name, and sealed them with his seale, and sent the letters vnto the Elders, and to the nobles that were in his citie dwelling with Naboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a  fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And set two wicked men before him, & let them witnesse against him, saying, Thou diddest blaspheme God and the King: then cary him out, and stone him that he may dye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the  men of his city, [even] the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, [and] as it [was] written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth among the chiefe of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came two wicked men, & sate before him: & the wicked men witnessed against Naboth in the presence of the people saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the King. Then they caried him away out of the citie, and stoned him with stones, that he dyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then they sent to Iezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned and is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab,  Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he rose to go downe to the vineyard of Naboth the Izreelite, to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the word of the Lord came vnto Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, goe downe to meete Ahab King of Israel, which is in Samaria. loe, he is in the vineyarde of Naboth, whither he is gone downe to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,  Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,  In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ahab sayd to Eliiah, Hast thou found mee, O mine enemie? And he answered, I haue found thee: for thou hast solde thy selfe to worke wickednes in the sight of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beholde, I will bring euill vpon thee, and wil take away thy posteritie, and wil cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, as well him that is shut vp, as him that is left in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I wil make thine house like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah, for the prouocation wherewith thou hast prouoked, and made Israel to sinne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And also of Iezebel spake the Lorde, saying, The dogs shall eate Iezebel, by the wall of Izreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The dogs shall eate him of Ahabs stocke, that dyeth in the citie: and him that dyeth in the fieldes, shall the foules of the ayre eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But there was none like unto Ahab, which did  sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he did exceeding abominably in following idoles, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went  softly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the worde of the Lord came to Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: [but] in his  son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
