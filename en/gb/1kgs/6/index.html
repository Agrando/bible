[and] ten cubits [was] the breadth thereof before the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And in the house he made windowes, broad without, and narrowe within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, [against] the walls of the house round about, [both] of the temple and of  the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The nethermost chamber [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] six cubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad: for without [in the wall] of the house he made narrowed  rests round about, that [the beams] should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the house was built, it was built of stone perfite, before it was brought, so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any toole of yron heard in the house, while it was in building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The doore of the middle chamber was in the right side of the house, & men went vp with winding stayres into the middlemost, and out of the middlemost into the third.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he built the  house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he built the galleries vpon al the wall of the house of fiue cubites height, and they were ioyned to the house with beames of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the worde of the Lord came to Salomon, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Cocerning this house which thou buildest, if thou wilt walke in mine ordinances, & execute my iudgements, & keepe al my commadements, to walke in them, then will I performe vnto thee my promes, which I promised to Dauid thy father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will  dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Salomon built the house & finished it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and  the walls of the cieling: [and] he covered [them] on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he built twentie cubites in the sides of the house with boards of cedar, from the floore to the walles, and he prepared a place within it for the oracle, euen the most holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the  house, that [is], the temple before it, was forty cubits [long].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the cedar of the house within was carued with knops, and grauen with floures: all was cedar, so that no stone was seene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the oracle he prepared in the  house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the place of the oracle within was twentie cubites long, and twentie cubites broad, and twentie cubites hie, and hee couered it with pure golde, and couered the altar with cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Salomon couered the house within with pure golde: and he shut the place of the oracle with chaines of gold, and couered it with golde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the  whole altar that [was] by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And within the oracle he made two Cherubims of oliue tree, ten cubites hie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The wing also of the one Cherub was fiue cubites, and the wing of the other Cherub was fiue cubites: from the vttermost part of one of his wings vnto the vttermost part of the other of his wings, were ten cubites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Also the other Cherub was of ten cubites: both the Cherubims were of one measure and one sise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the height of the one Cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other Cherub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he put the Cherubims within the inner house, and the Cherubims stretched out their wings, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other Cherub touched the other wall: and their other wings touched one another in the middes of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he  overlaid the cherubims with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he carued all the walles of the house round about with grauen figures of Cherubims and of Palmetrees, and grauen flowres within and without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the floore of the house hee couered with golde within and without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And in the entring of the oracle he made two doores of oliue tree: and the vpper post and side postes were fiue square.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The two doors also [were of] olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid [them] with gold, and  spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And so made he for the doore of the Temple, postes of oliue tree foure square.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the two doores were of firre tree, the two sides of the one doore were round, and the two sides of the other doore were round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he graued Cherubims, & palme trees, and carued floures and couered the carued worke with golde, finely wrought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he built the inner  court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the fourth yeere was the foundation of the house of the Lorde layed in the moneth of Zif:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And in the eleventh year, in the month  Bul, which [is] the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it.
