And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,  I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel,  Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the king of Israel gathered the  prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the  LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but  I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king of Israel called an  officer, and said, Hasten [hither] Micaiah the son of Imlah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their  robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him  horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the prophets prophecied so, saying, Goe vp to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliuer it into the Kings hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good unto the king with  one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak [that which is] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Michaiah saide, As the Lord liueth, whatsoeuer the Lord sayth vnto me, that will I speake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him,  Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the King said vnto him, How oft shall I charge thee, that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the Name of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said,  These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(And the King of Israel saide vnto Iehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee, that he would prophecie no good vnto me, but euill?)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the  host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord sayd, Who shall entise Ahab that he may go and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And one said on this maner, and another sayd on that maner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there came forth a spirit, and  stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a  lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade [him], and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirite in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath appoynted euill against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said,  Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Michaiah saide, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt goe from chamber to chamber to hide thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the King of Israel sayd, Take Michaiah, and cary him vnto Amon the gouernour of the citie, and vnto Ioash the Kings sonne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with  bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said,  Hearken, O people, every one of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the King of Israel and Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah went vp to Ramoth Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the King of Israel sayde to Iehoshaphat, I will change mine apparell, and will enter into the battell, but put thou on thine apparell; the King of Israel changed himselfe, and went into the battel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the King of Aram commaunded his two and thirtie captaines ouer his charets, saying, Fight neither with small, nor great, saue onely against the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it [is] the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat  cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the captaines of the charets saw that he was not the King of Israel, they turned backe from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then a certaine man drewe a bow mightily and smote the King of Israel betweene the ioyntes of his brigandine. Wherefore he sayde vnto his charet man, Turne thine hand and cary me out of the hoste: for I am hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the battle increased that day: and the  king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there went a proclamation throughout the  host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So the King died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the King in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And one washed the charet in the poole of Samaria, and the dogs licked vp his blood (and they washed his armour) according vnto the word of the Lord which he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Concerning the rest of the actes of Ahab and all that he did, and the yuorie house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his sonne reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Iehoshaphat the sonne of Asa began to reigne vpon Iudah in the fourth yeere of Ahab King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Iehoshaphat was fiue and thirty yere olde, when he began to reigne, and reigned fiue and twentie yeere in Ierusalem; his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless  the high places were not taken away; [for] the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Iehoshaphat made peace with the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Concerning the rest of the actes of Iehoshaphat, and his worthy deedes that he did, and his battels which he fought, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the Sodomites, which remayned in the dayes of his father Asa, he put cleane out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>[There was] then no king in Edom: a  deputy [was] king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jehoshaphat made ships of  Tharshish to go to  Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then sayde Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab vnto Iehoshaphat, Let my seruants goe with thy seruants in the ships, But Iehoshaphat would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Iehoshaphat did sleepe with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid his father, and Iehoram his sonne reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, the seuenteenth yeere of Iehoshaphat King of Iudah, and reigned two yeeres ouer Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he did euill in the sight of the Lorde, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For he serued Baal and worshipped him, and prouoked the Lorde God of Israel vnto wrath, according vnto all that his father had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
