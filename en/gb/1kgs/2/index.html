And she said,  Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said moreouer, I haue a sute vnto thee; she sayd, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and [that] all Israel  set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Nowe therefore I aske thee one request, refuse me not; she said vnto him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he sayd, Speake, I pray thee, vnto Salomon ye King, (for he will not say thee nay) that he giue me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bath-sheba sayd, Well, I will speake for thee vnto the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and  bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then she sayd, I desire a small request of thee, say me not nay. Then the King sayde vnto her, Aske on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>She sayd then, Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the  kingdom also; for he [is] mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then King Salomon sware by the Lorde, saying, God doe so to me and more also, if Adoniiah hath not spoken this worde against his owne life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now therefore as ye Lord liueth, who hath established me, & set me on the throne of Dauid my father, who also hath made me an house, as he promised, Adoniiah shall surely die this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And King Salomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and hee smote him that he dyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou [art] worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou  barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Salomon cast out Abiathar from being Priest vnto the Lord, that he might fulfill the wordes of the Lord, which he spake against the house of Eli in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had  turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, [he is] by the  altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Benaiah came to the Tabernacle of the Lord, & sayd vnto him, Thus sayth the King, Come out; he sayde, Nay, but I will die here. Then Benaiah brought the King worde againe, saying, Thus sayd Ioab, & thus he answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and  fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the Lorde shall bring his blood vpon his owne head: for he smote two men more righteous and better then he, and slew them with the sword, & my father Dauid knew not: to wit, Abner the sonne of Ner, captaine of the hoste of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of Iether captaine of the hoste of Iudah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their blood shall therefore return upon the  head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada went vp, & smote him, and slewe him, & he was buryed in his owne house in the wildernesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the  priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Afterwarde the King sent, & called Shimei, and sayde vnto him, Buylde thee an house in Ierusalem, and dwell there, and depart not thence any whither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For that day that thou goest out, and passest ouer the riuer of Kidron, knowe assuredly, that thou shalt dye the death: thy blood shall be vpon thine owne head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Shimei sayd vnto the King, The thing is good: as my lord the King hath sayd, so wil thy seruant doe. So Shimei dwelt in Ierusalem many dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the  servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants [be] in Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and  Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it was tolde Salomon, that Shimei had gone from Ierusalem to Gath, and was come againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the King sent and called Shimei, and sayde vnto him, Did I not make thee to sweare by the Lorde, and protested vnto thee, saying, That day that thou goest out, and walkest any whither, knowe assuredly that thou shalt dye the death? And thou saydest vnto mee, The thing is good, that I haue heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why then hast thou not kept the othe of the Lorde, and the commandement wherewith I charged thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The king said moreover to Shimei,  Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And let King Salomon be blessed, and the throne of Dauid stablished before the Lorde for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was  established in the hand of Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
