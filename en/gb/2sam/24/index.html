And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they  done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Gad came the same day to Dauid, and said vnto him, Go vp, reare an altar vnto the Lord in the threshing floore of Araunah the Iebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Dauid (according to the saying of Gad) went vp, as the Lord had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Araunah looked, and sawe the King and his seruants comming towarde him, and Araunah went out, and bowed himselfe before the King on his face to the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And  Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Araunah saide vnto Dauid, Let my lord the King take and offer what seemeth him good in his eyes: beholde the oxen for the burnt offring, and charets, and the instruments of the oxen for wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these [things] did Araunah,  [as] a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy [it] of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for  fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Dauid built there an altar vnto the Lorde, and offred burnt offrings and peace offrings, and the Lord was appeased toward ye lande, and the plague ceased from Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
