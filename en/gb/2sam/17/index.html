For the LORD had appointed to defeat the  good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might  bring evil upon Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said Hushai vnto Zadok and to Abiathar the Priests, Of this and that maner did Ahithophel and the Elders of Israel counsell Absalom: and thus and thus haue I counseled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass  over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that [are] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told  them; and they went and told king David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Neuerthelesse a yong man sawe them, and tolde it to Absalom. therefore they both departed quickely, and came to a mans house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, into the which they went downe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And  the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where [is] Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the  brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find [them], they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for  thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David arose, and all the people that [were] with him, and they passed over Jordan:  by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled [his] ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and  hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Dauid came to Mahanaim; Absalom passed ouer Iorden, he, and all the men of Israel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa [was] a man's son, whose name [was] Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of  Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Dauid was come to Mahanaim, Shobi the sonne of Nahash out of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the sonne of Ammiel out of Lo-debar, and Barzelai the Gileadite out of Rogel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched [corn], and beans, and lentiles, and parched [pulse],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they brought honie, and butter, and sheepe, and cheese of kine for Dauid and for the people that were with him, to eate: for they said, The people is hungry, and wearie, and thirstie in the wildernesse.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
