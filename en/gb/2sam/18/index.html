So the King stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreths and by thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the King commanded Ioab and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Entreate the yong man Absalom gently for my sake; all the people heard whe the King gaue al the captaines charge concerning Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the  wood of Ephraim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Where the people of Israel were slaine before the seruants of Dauid: so there was a great slaughter that day, euen of twentie thousande.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the battel was skattered ouer all the countrey: and the wood deuoured much more people that day, then did the sworde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nowe Absalom met the seruants of Dauid, and Absalom rode vpon a mule, and the mule came vnder a great thicke oke: and his head caught holde of the oke, and he was taken vp betweene the heauen and the earth: and the mule that was vnder him went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And one that sawe it, tolde Ioab, saying, Beholde, I sawe Absalom hanged in an oke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Ioab saide vnto the man that tolde him, And hast thou in deede seene? why then diddest thou not there smite him to the grounde, and I woulde haue giuen thee ten shekels of siluer, and a girdle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the man saide vnto Ioab, Though I should receiue a thousande shekels of siluer in mine hande, yet woulde I not lay mine hande vpon the Kings sonne: for in our hearing the King charged thee, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Beware, least any touche the yong man Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If I had done it, it had bene the danger of my life: for nothing can be hid from the King: yea, thou thy selfe wouldest haue bin against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then saide Ioab, I will not thus tary with thee; he tooke three dartes in his hande, and thrust them through Absalom, while he was yet aliue in the middes of the oke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And tenne seruants that bare Ioabs armour, compassed about and smote Absalom, and slewe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joab  blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great  pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which [is] in the king's dale: for he said, I have no  son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok, I pray thee, let me runne, and beare the King tidings that the Lorde hath deliuered him out of the hande of his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joab said unto him, Thou  shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Ioab to Cushi, Goe, tel the king, what thou hast seene; Cushi bowed himselfe vnto Ioab, and ran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then saide Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok againe to Ioab, What, I pray thee, if I also runne after Cushi?

And the king said, He [is] a  good man, and cometh with good tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Ahimaaz called, and sayde vnto the King, Peace be with thee: and he fell downe to the earth vpon his face before the King, and saide, Blessed be the Lorde thy God, who hath shut vp the men that lift vp their handes against my lorde the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's  servant, and [me] thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what [it was].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the King said vnto him, Turne aside, and stand here. so he turned aside & stoode still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And beholde, Cushi came, and Cushi saide, Tidings, my lorde the King: for the Lord hath deliuered thee this day out of the hande of all that rose against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the King saide vnto Cushi, Is the yong man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lorde the King, and all that rise against thee to doe thee hurt, be as that yong man is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king was much  moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
