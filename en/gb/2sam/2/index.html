And he answered, Yea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Abner said, Turne thee either to the right hande, or to the left, and take one of the yong men, and take thee his weapons: and Asahel would not depart from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me:  wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the  fifth [rib], that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, [that] as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ioab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sunne went downe, when they were come to the hill Ammah, that lieth before Giah, by the way of the wildernesse of Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the children of Beniamin gathered them selues together after Abner, and were on an heape and stoode on the top of an hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the  sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unless thou hadst  spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Ioab blew a trumpet, and all the people stoode still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plaine, and went ouer Iorden, and past through all Bithron till they came to Mahanaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Ioab also returned backe from Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of Dauids seruants nineteene men and Asahel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three  hundred and threescore men died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they tooke vp Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem: and Ioab and his men went all night, & when they came to Hebron, the day arose.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
