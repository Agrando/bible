And the LORD answered, [It is] for Saul, and for [his] bloody house, because he slew the  Gibeonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then ye King called the Gibeonites and said vnto them. (Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but a remnant of the Amorites, vnto whom ye children of Israel had sworne: but Saul sought to slay them for his zeale toward the children of Israel and Iudah)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites,  What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill  any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, [that] will I do for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then they answered the King, The man that consumed vs and that imagined euill against vs, so that we are destroyed from remaining in any coast of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let seven men of his  sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up  unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, [whom] the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the King had compassion on Mephibosheth the sonne of Ionathan the sonne of Saul, because of the Lordes othe, that was betweene them, euen betweene Dauid and Ionathan the sonne of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of  Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell [all] seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the  first [days], in the beginning of barley harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took  sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until  water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was told Dauid, what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah ye concubine of Saul had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Dauid went and tooke the bones of Saul and the bones of Ionathan his sonne from the citizens of Iabesh Gilead, which had stollen them from the streete of Beth-shan, where the Philistims had hanged them, when the Philistims had slaine Saul in Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So hee brought thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Ionathan his sonne, and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was  intreated for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Againe the Philistims had warre with Israel: and Dauid went downe, and his seruants with him, and they fought against the Philistims, and Dauid fainted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ishbibenob, which [was] of the sons of  the giant, the weight of whose spear [weighed] three hundred  [shekels] of brass in weight, he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the  light of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at  Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which [was] of the sons of the giant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew [the brother of]  Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear [was] like a weaver's beam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Afterward there was also a battel in Gath, where was a man of a great stature, and had on euerie hand sixe fingers, and on euerie foote sixe toes, foure and twentie in nomber: who was also the sonne of Haraphah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when hee reuiled Israel, Ionathan the sonne of Shima the brother of Dauid slewe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These foure were borne to Haraphah in Gath, and died by the hande of Dauid and by the hands of his seruants.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
