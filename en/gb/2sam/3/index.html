These were born to David in  Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Nowe while there was warre betweene the house of Saul and the house of Dauid, Abner made all his power for the house of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiiah; Ish-bosheth sayde to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in to my fathers concubine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, [Am] I a  dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To remoue the kingdome from the house of Saul, that the throne of Dauid may be stablished ouer Israel, and ouer Iudah, euen from Dan to Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he durst no more answere to Abner: for he feared him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Abner sent messengers to Dauid on his behalfe, saying, Whose is the lande? who should also say, Make couenant with me, and beholde, mine hande shalbe with thee, to bring all Israel vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who saide, Well, I will make a couenant with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, that thou see not my face except thou bring Michal Sauls daughter when thou commest to see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Dauid sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Sauls sonne, saying, Deliuer me my wife Michal, which I marryed for an hundreth foreskinnes of the Philistims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Ish-bosheth sent, and tooke her from her husband Phaltiel the sonne of Laish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And her husband went with her, & came weeping behinde her, vnto Bahurim: then saide Abner vnto him, Go, and returne. So he returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abner had  communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past [to be] king over you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Nowe then doe it: for the Lord hath spoken of Dauid, saying, By the hand of my seruant Dauid I will saue my people Israel out of the handes of the Philistims, and out of the handes of all their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole  house of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Abner came to Dauid to Hebron, hauing twentie men with him, and Dauid made a feast vnto Abner, and to the men that were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Abner sayde vnto Dauid, I will rise vp, and goe gather all Israel vnto my lorde the King, that they may make a couenant with thee, and that thou mayest reigne ouer all that thine heart desireth. Then Dauid let Abner depart, who went in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came  from [pursuing] a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner [was] not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When Ioab, & all the hoste that was with him were come, men tolde Ioab, saying, Abner the sonne of Ner came to the King, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Joab came to the king, and said,  What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why [is] it [that] thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou knowest Abner the sonne of Ner: for he came to deceiue thee, and to knowe thy outgoing and ingoing, and to knowe all that thou doest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Ioab was gone out from Dauid, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him againe from the well of Siriah vnknowing to Dauid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Abner was come againe to Hebron, Ioab tooke him aside in the gate to speake with him peaceably, and smote him vnder the fift ryb, that he dyed, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And afterward when David heard [it], he said, I and my kingdom [are]  guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let the blood fall on the head of Ioab, and on all his fathers house, that the house of Ioab be neuer without some that haue running issues, or leper, or that leaneth on a staffe, or that doeth fall on the sworde, or that lacketh bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Joab and  Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that [were] with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn  before Abner. And king David [himself] followed the bier.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they had buryed Abner in Hebron, the King lift vp his voyce, and wept beside the sepulchre of Abner, and all the people wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner  as a fool dieth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Thine handes were not bounde, nor thy feete tyed in fetters of brasse: but as a man falleth before wicked men, so diddest thou fall; all the people wept againe for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when all the people came to cause David to eat  meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the people took notice [of it], and it  pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For all the people and all Israel vnderstoode that day, howe that it was not the Kings deede that Abner the sonne of Ner was slaine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the King said vnto his seruants, Know ye not, that there is a prince & a great man falle this day in Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I am this day weake and newly anoynted King: and these men the sonnes of Zeruiah be too harde for me: the Lorde rewarde the doer of euill according to his wickednesse.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
