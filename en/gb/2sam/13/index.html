Then Amnon answered him, I loue Tamar my brother Absaloms sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jonadab said unto him,  Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see [it], and eat [it] at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of  cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Dauid sent home to Tamar, saying, Goe now to thy brother Amnons house, and dresse him meate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house, and he lay downe: and she tooke floure, and knead it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she took a pan, and  poured [them] out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from  me. And they went out every man from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Amnon said vnto Tamar, Bring the meate into the chamber, that I may eate of thine hand; Tamar tooke the cakes which shee had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she had set them before him to eate, he tooke her, and sayd vnto her, Come, lye with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But shee answered him, Nay, my brother, doe not force me: for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: commit not this follie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of  the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Howbeit he would not hearken vnto her voyce, but being stronger then she, forced her, and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred wherewith he hated her, was greater then the loue, wherewith hee had loued her: and Amnon sayde vnto her, Vp, get thee hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she answered him, There is no cause: this euill (to put mee away) is greater then the other that thou diddest vnto me: but he would not heare her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But called his seruant that serued him, & sayd, Put this woman now out from me, & locke the doore after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And [she had] a garment of  divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters [that were] virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent the garment of diuers colours which was on her, and layde her hand on her head, and went her way crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but  hold now thy peace, my sister: he [is] thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when King Dauid heard all these things, he was very wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Absalom sayde vnto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which [is] beside Ephraim: and  Absalom invited all the king's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Absalom came to the King and sayd, Beholde now, thy seruant hath sheepesherers: I pray thee, that the King with his seruants would goe with thy seruant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the King answered Absalom, Nay my sonne, I pray thee, let vs not goe all, lest we be chargeable vnto thee. Yet Absalom lay sore vpon him: howbeit he would not go, but thaked him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother  Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Absalom was instant vpon him, & he sent Amnon with him, & all the Kings children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not  I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the seruantes of Absalom did vnto Amnon, as Absalom had commanded: and al the Kings sonnes arose, and euery man gate him vp vpon his mule, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And while they were in the way, tydings came to Dauid, saying, Absalom hath slaine al the Kings sonnes, & there is not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the  earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Ionadab the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother answered and sayde, Let not my lord suppose that they haue slayne all the yong men the Kings sonnes: for Amnon onely is dead, because Absalom had reported so, since hee forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nowe therefore let not my lord the King take the thing so grieuously, to thinke that all ye Kings sonnes are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Absalom fled: and the yong man that kept the watch, lift vp his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behinde him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said,  so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And assoone as hee had left speaking, behold, the Kings sonnes came, & lift vp their voyces, and wept: and the King also and all his seruants wept exceedingly sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Absalom fled, and went to  Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three yeeres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And King Dauid desired to go forth vnto Absalom, because he was pacified concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
