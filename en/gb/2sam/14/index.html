And she answered, I am in deede a widow, and mine husband is dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thy handmaid had two  sons, and they two strove together in the field, and [there was] none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the  life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband [neither] name nor remainder upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the King said vnto the woman, Go to thine house, and I wil giue a charge for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the  iniquity [be] on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne [be] guiltless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the King sayde, Bring him to me that speaketh against thee, and he shall touche thee no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said she, I pray thee, let the king  remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, [As] the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the woman said, I pray thee, let thine handmayde speake a worde to my lord the King; he sayd, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou  thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we must needs die, and [are] as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect [any] person: yet doth he devise  means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, [it is] because the people  have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the King wil heare, to deliuer his handmayde out of the hande of the man that woulde destroy mee, and also my sonne from the inheritance of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an  angel of God, so [is] my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the King answered, and said vnto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall aske thee; the woman sayde, Let my lord the King now speake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the king said, [Is not]  the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, [As] thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To fetch about this  form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord [is] wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all [things] that [are] in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have  done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Ioab fell to the grounde on his face, and bowed himselfe, & thanked the King. Then Ioab sayde, This day thy seruant knoweth, that I haue found grace in thy sight, my lord the King, in that the King hath fulfilled the request of his seruant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Ioab arose, and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Ierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said, Let him  turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nowe in all Israel there was none to be so much praysed for beautie as Absalom: from the sole of his foote euen to the toppe of his head there was no blemish in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled [it]: because [the hair] was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred  shekels after the king's weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Absalom had three sonnes, and one daughter named Tamar, which was a fayre woman to looke vpon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Absalom dwelt the space of two yeres in Ierusalem, and saw not the Kings face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore Absalom sent for Ioab to sende him to the King, but he would not come to him: and when he sent againe, he would not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it  on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Ioab arose, & came to Absalom vnto his house, & sayd vnto him, Wherefore haue thy seruants burnt my field with fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? [it had been] good for me [to have been] there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and  if there be [any] iniquity in me, let him kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Ioab came to the King, & told him: & he called for Absalom, who came to the King, and bowed himselfe to the grounde on his face before the King, and the King kissed Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
