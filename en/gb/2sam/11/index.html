But David tarried still at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his  bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman [was] very beautiful to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David sent and enquired after the woman. And [one] said, [Is] not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the  Hittite?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Dauid sent messengers, & tooke her away: and she came vnto him & he lay with her: (now she was purified from her vncleannes) & she returned vnto her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the woman conceived, and sent and  told David, and said, I [am] with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Dauid sent to Ioab, saying, Send me Vriah the Hittite; Ioab sent Vriah to Dauid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Vriah came vnto him, Dauid demanded him how Ioab did, and howe the people fared, and how the warre prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Uriah,  Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess [of meat] from the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Vriah slept at the doore of the Kings palace with all the seruants of his lord, and went not downe to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then they tolde Dauid, saying, Vriah went not downe to his house: and Dauid saide vnto Vriah, Commest thou not from thy iourney? why didst thou not go downe to thine house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Uriah said unto David,  The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? [as] thou livest, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Dauid sayd vnto Vriah, Tary yet this day, & to morow I will send thee away. So Vriah abode in Ierusalem that day, and the morowe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him  drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And on the morowe Dauid wrote a letter to Ioab, and sent it by the hand of Vriah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he wrote in the letter, saying,  Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So when Ioab besieged the citie, he assigned Vriah vnto a place, where he knewe that strong men were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of the citie came out, and fought with Ioab: and there fell of the people of the seruants of Dauid, and Vriah the Hittite also dyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Ioab sent and tolde Dauid all the things concerning the warre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an ende of telling all the matters of the warre vnto the King,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if the kings anger arise, so that he say vnto thee, Wherefore approched ye vnto the citie to fight? knewe ye not that they would hurle from the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who smote Abimelech the son of  Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the messenger went, and came & shewed Dauid all that Ioab had sent him for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the messenger said vnto Dauid, Certainely the men preuailed against vs, and came out vnto vs into the field, but we pursued them vnto the entring of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the shooters shot from ye wall against thy seruants, and some of the Kings seruants be dead: & thy seruant Vriah the Hittite is also dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then David said unto the messenger,  Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the wife of Vriah heard that her husband Vriah was dead, she mourned for her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So when the mourning was past, Dauid sent and tooke her into his house, and shee became his wife, and bare him a sonne: but ye thing that Dauid had done, displeased the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
