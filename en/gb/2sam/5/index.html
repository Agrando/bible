Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not  come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.

And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Dauid came to Baal-perazim, & smote them there, and sayde, The Lorde hath deuided mine enemies asunder before mee, as waters be deuided asunder: therefore he called the name of that place, Baal-perazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there they left their images, and Dauid and his men burnt them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of  Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Dauid asked counsell of the Lorde, hee answered, Thou shalt not goe vp, but turne about behinde them, and come vpon them ouer against the mulberie trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when thou hearest the noyse of one going in the toppes of the mulberie trees, then remoue: for then shall the Lord goe out before thee, to smite the hoste of the Philistims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to  Gazer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
