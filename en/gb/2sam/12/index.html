And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The rich man had exceeding many sheepe and oxen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the poore had none at all, saue one litle sheepe which he had bought, and nourished vp: and it grew vp with him, and with his children also, and did eate of his owne morsels, and dranke of his owne cup, and slept in his bosome, and was vnto him as his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now there came a stranger vnto the rich man, who refused to take of his owne sheepe, and of his owne oxen to dresse for the stranger that was come vnto him, but tooke the poore mans sheepe, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Dauid was exceeding wroth with the man, and sayde to Nathan, As the Lorde liueth, the man that hath done this thing, shall surely dye,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he shall restore the lambe foure folde, because he did this thing, and had no pitie thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Nathan sayd to Dauid, Thou art the man. Thus sayth the Lord God of Israel, I anoynted thee King ouer Israel, and deliuered thee out of the hand of Saul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I gave thee thy master's  house, and thy master's  wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if [that had been] too little, I would moreover have given unto thee  such and such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife [to be] thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the  children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore the sworde shall neuer depart from thine house, because thou hast despised me, and taken the wife of Vriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give [them] unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this  sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thou diddest it secretly: but I will doe this thing before all Israel, and before the sunne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath  put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to  blaspheme, the child also [that is] born unto thee shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Nathan departed vnto his house: and the Lord stroke the childe that Vriahs wife bare vnto Dauid, and it was sicke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and  went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat  bread with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So on the seuenth day the child dyed: and the seruants of Dauid feared to tell him that the childe was dead: for they sayde, Beholde, while the childe was aliue, we spake vnto him, and he woulde not hearken vnto our voyce: how then shall we say vnto him, The childe is dead, to vexe him more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when Dauid sawe that his seruantes whispered, Dauid perceiued that the childe was dead: therefore Dauid sayde vnto his seruants, Is the childe dead? And they sayd, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David  arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed [himself], and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then  said his servants unto him, What thing [is] this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, [while it was] alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he sayde, While the childe was yet aliue, I fasted, and wept: for I sayde, Who can tell whether God will haue mercy on me, that the childe may liue?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?  can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and  he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the  prophet; and  he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Ioab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and tooke the citie of the kingdome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of  waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, & besiege the city, that thou mayest take it, lest the victorie be attributed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So Dauid gathered al the people together, and went against Rabbah, and besieged it, and tooke it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof [was] a  talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was [set] on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he brought forth the people that [were] therein, and put [them] under  saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
