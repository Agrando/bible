And he said, Thy servant [is] of one of the  tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Absalom said vnto him, See, thy matters are good and righteous, but there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Absalom said moreover,  Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when any man came neere to him, and did him obeisance, he put forth his hand, & tooke him, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom  stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass after  forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will  serve the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the King sayd vnto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Absalom sent spyes throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When yee heare the sound of the trumpet, Ye shal say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, [that were]  called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Also Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite Dauids counseller, from his citie Giloh, while he offred sacrifices: & the treason was great: for the people encreased still with Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then came a messenger to Dauid, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are turned after Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said unto all his servants that [were] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from  Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Kings seruants sayd vnto him, Behold, thy seruants are ready to do according to all that my lord the King shal appoynt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the King departed and all his houshold after him, and the King left ten concubines to keepe the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was  far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the  Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said the king to  Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou [art] a stranger, and also an exile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whereas thou camest [but] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy  brethren: mercy and  truth [be] with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ittai answered the King, and sayde, As the Lorde liueth, and as my lord the King liueth, in what place my lord the King shalbe, whether in death or life, euen there surely will thy seruant bee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Dauid sayd to Ittai, Come, & go forward; Ittai the Gittite went, and all his men, and all the children that were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and  all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites [were] with him,  bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went  up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the King said vnto Zadok, Carie the Arke of God againe into the citie: if I shall finde fauour in the eyes of the Lorde, he will bring me againe, and shewe me both it, and the Tabernacle thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold,  [here am] I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The King sayde againe vnto Zadok the Priest, Art not thou a Seer? returne into the citie in peace, and your two sonnes with you: to wit, Ahimaaz thy sonne, and Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Behold, I wil tarie in the fieldes of the wildernesse, vntill there come some worde from you to be tolde me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Zadok therefore and Abiathar caried the Arke of God againe to Ierusalem, and they taried there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And David went up by the ascent of [mount] Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head  covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that [was] with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And [one] told David, saying, Ahithophel [is] among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the  counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Dauid came to the toppe of the mount where he worshipped God: and beholde, Hushai the Archite came against him with his coate torne, and hauing earth vpon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Vnto whom Dauid sayd, If thou goe with me, thou shalt be a burthen vnto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy  servant, O king; [as] I [have been] thy father's servant hitherto, so [will] I now also [be] thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the Priests? therefore what so euer thou shalt heare out of the Kings house, thou shalt shew to Zadok and Abiathar the Priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Beholde, there are with them their two sonnes: Ahimaaz Zadoks sonne, and Ionathan Abiathars sonne: by them also shall ye send me euery thing that ye can heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So Hushai Dauids friend went into the citie: and Absalom came into Ierusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
