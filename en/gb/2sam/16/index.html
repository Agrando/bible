And Ziba said, The  asses [be] for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king sayde, But where is thy masters sonne? Then Ziba answered the King, Beholde, he remayneth in Ierusalem: for he sayde, This day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdome of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said the King to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that perteined vnto Mephibosheth; Ziba saide, I beseech thee, let me finde grace in thy sight, my lord, O King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when king David came to  Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name [was] Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men [were] on his  right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus sayde Shimei when hee cursed, Come forth, come foorth thou murtherer, and wicked man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The LORD hath returned upon thee all the  blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou [art taken] in thy mischief, because thou [art] a bloody man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then saide Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah vnto the King, Why doeth this dead dog curse my lord the King? let me goe, I pray thee, and take away his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath  said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Dauid sayd to Abishai, and to all his seruants, Beholde, my sonne which came out of mine owne bowels, seeketh my life: then howe much more now may this sonne of Iemini? Suffer him to curse: for the Lord hath bidden him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will  requite me good for his cursing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as Dauid and his men went by the way, Shimei went by the side of the mountaine ouer against him, and cursed as he went, & threw stones against him, and cast dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves  there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Absalom, & all the people, the men of Israel, came to Ierusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Hushai the Archite Dauids friend was come vnto Absalom, Hushai said vnto Absalom, God saue the King, God saue the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Absalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy kindness to thy  friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hushai then answered vnto Absalom, Nay, but whome the Lord, and this people, and all the men of Israel chuse, his will I be, and with him will I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And moreouer vnto whome shall I doe seruice? not to his sonne? as I serued before thy father, so will I before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then spake Absalom to Ahithophel, Giue counsell what we shall doe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And  Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that [are] with thee be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread Absalom a tent vpon the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his fathers concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, [was] as if a man had  enquired at the oracle of God: so [was] all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
