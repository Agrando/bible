And he said vnto him, Out of the host of Israel I am escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Dauid saide vnto him, What is done? I pray thee, tell me. Then he said, that the people is fled from the battel, and many of the people are ouerthrowen, and dead, & also Saul and Ionathan his sonne are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Dauid saide vnto the yong man that tolde it him, Howe knowest thou that Saul and Ionathan his sonne be dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man that told him said,  As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he looked backe, he saw me, and called me; I answered, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered him, I [am] an  Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my  life [is] yet whole in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I came vpon him, and slewe him, and because I was sure that hee coulde not liue, after that hee had fallen, I tooke the crowne that was vpon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arme, and brought them hither vnto my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Dauid tooke hold on his clothes, & rent them, and likewise al the men that were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they mourned and wept, and fasted vntil euen, for Saul and for Ionathan his sonne, & for the people of the Lorde, and for the house of Israel, because they were slaine with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence [art] thou? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Dauid said vnto him, How wast thou not afrayd, to put forth thine hand to destroy the Anoynted of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Dauid called one of his yong men, and said, Goe neere, and fall vpon him; hee smote him that he dyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said unto him,  Thy blood [be] upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Dauid mourned with this lamentation ouer Saul, and ouer Ionathan his sonne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah  [the use of] the bow: behold, [it is] written in the book of Jasher.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The beauty of Israel is  slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tell it not in Gath, nor publish it in the streetes of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistims reioyce, lest the daughters of the vncircumcised triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye mountains of Gilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you, nor  fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, [as though he had] not [been] anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The bow of Ionathan neuer turned backe, neither did the sword of Saul returne emptie from the blood of the slaine, and from the fatte of the mightie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not  divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet,  with [other] delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Howe were the mightie slaine in the mids of the battel! O Ionathan, thou wast slaine in thine hie places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of  women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Howe are the mightie ouerthrowen, and the weapons of warre destroyed!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
