And all [they of] Israel were  a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah [was]  four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the Leuites and Beniamin counted he not among them: for the Kings worde was abominable to Ioab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God was displeased with this thing: therefore he smote Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Dauid saide vnto God, I haue sinned greatly, because I haue done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, remooue the iniquitie of thy seruant: for I haue done very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lorde spake vnto Gad Dauids Seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Goe and tell Dauid, saying, Thus saith the Lorde, I offer thee three thinges: choose thee one of them, that I may doe it vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Gad came to Dauid, and sayde vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Take to thee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Either three yeeres famine, or three moneths to be destroyed before thine aduersaries, and the sworde of thine enemies to take thee, or els the sworde of the Lorde and pestilence in the lande three dayes, that the Angel of the Lorde may destroy throughout all the coastes of Israel: nowe therefore aduise thee, what word I shal bring againe to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Dauid said vnto Gad, I am in a wonderfull strait. Let me nowe fall into the hande of the Lorde: for his mercies are exceeding great, and let me not fall into the hande of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel, and there fell of Israel seuentie thousande men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and  as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he  repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Dauid lift vp his eyes, and sawe the Angel of the Lorde stande betweene the earth and the heauen with his sworde drawen in his hand, and stretched out towarde Ierusalem. Then Dauid and the Elders of Israel, which were clothed in sacke, fell vpon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said unto God, [Is it] not I [that] commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but [as for] these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on  thy people, that they should be plagued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to Dauid, that Dauid should goe vp, and set vp an altar vnto the Lord in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Dauid went vp according to the saying of Gad, which he had spoken in the Name of the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him  hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as Dauid came to Ornan, Ornan looked and sawe Dauid, and went out of the thresshing floore, and bowed himselfe to Dauid with his face to the grounde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of [this] threshingfloor, that I may build an  altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ornan saide vnto Dauid, Take it to thee, and let my lord the King do that which seemeth him good: loe, I giue thee bullockes for burnt offrings, and thresshing instruments for wood, and wheat for meate offring, I giue it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full  price: for I will not take [that] which [is] thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David gave to Ornan for the place  six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he  answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the Lorde had spoken to the Angel, he put vp his sworde againe into his sheath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At that time when Dauid sawe that the Lorde had heard him in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(But the Tabernacle of the Lorde which Moses had made in the wildernesse, and the altar of burnt offring were at that season in the hie place at Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Dauid could not go before it to aske counsel at God: for he was afraide of the sworde of the Angel of the Lorde.)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
