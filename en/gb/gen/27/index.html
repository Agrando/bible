Who answered, I am here: who art thou, my sonne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jacob said unto his father,  I [am] Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Izhak said vnto his sonne, Howe hast thou founde it so quickly my sonne? Who sayde, Because the Lorde thy God brought it to mine hande.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Againe sayde Izhak vnto Iaakob, Come neere nowe, that I may feele thee, my sonne, whether thou be that my sonne Esau or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The  voice [is] Jacob's voice, but the hands [are] the hands of Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(For he knewe him not, because his hands were rough as his brother Esaus hands: wherefore he blessed him)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Againe he sayd, Art thou that my sonne Esau? Who answered, Yea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said he, Bring it me hither, and I will eate of my sonnes venison, that my soule may blesse thee; he brought it to him, and he ate: also he brought him wine, and he dranke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Afterward his father Izhak sayd vnto him, Come neere nowe, and kisse me, my sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And hee came neere and kissed him. Then he smelled the sauour of his garmentes, and blessed him, and sayde, Behold, the smell of my sonne is as the smell of a fielde, which the Lorde hath blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God giue thee therefore of the dewe of heauen, and the fatnesse of the earth, and plentie of wheate and wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let people bee thy seruantes, and nations bowe vnto thee: be Lorde ouer thy brethren, and let thy mothers children honour thee. Cursed be he that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Izhak had made an ende of blessing Iaakob, and Iaakob was scarce gone out from the presence of Izhak his father, then came Esau his brother from his hunting,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And hee also prepared sauourie meate and brought it to his father, and sayd vnto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his sonnes venison, that thy soule may blesse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But his father Izhak sayde vnto him, Who art thou? And he answered, I am thy sonne, euen thy first borne Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Isaac  trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where [is] he that hath taken venison, and brought [it] me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When Esau heard the wordes of his father, he cryed out with a great crye and bitter, out of measure, and sayde vnto his father, Blesse me, euen me also, my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who answered, Thy brother came with subtiltie, and hath taken away thy blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, Is not he rightly named  Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him  thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Esau sayde vnto his father, Hast thou but one blessing my father? blesse mee, euen me also, my father: and Esau lifted vp his voyce, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Izhak his father answered, and sayde vnto him, Behold, the fatnesse of the earth shal be thy dwelling place, and thou shalt haue of the dewe of heauen from aboue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And  by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt  serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand;  then will I slay my brother Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau,  as touching thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now therefore my sonne, heare my voyce, arise, & flee thou to Haran to my brother Laban,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And tarie with him a while vntill thy brothers fiercenesse be swaged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget [that] which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be  deprived also of you both in one day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the  daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these [which are] of the daughters of the land,  what good shall my life do me?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
