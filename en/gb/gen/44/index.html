And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in the morning the men were sent away, they, and their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they went out of the citie not farre off, Ioseph sayd to his stewarde, Vp, followe after the men: and when thou doest ouertake them, say vnto them, Wherefore haue ye rewarded euill for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and  whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when he ouertooke them, he sayde those wordes vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they answered him, Wherefore sayeth my lorde such wordes? God forbid that thy seruants should do such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the money which we found in our sackes mouthes, wee brought againe to thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steale out of thy lordes house siluer or golde?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomesoeuer of thy seruants it bee found, let him dye, and we also will be my lordes bondmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now then let it be according vnto your wordes: he with whome it is found, shal be my seruant, and ye shalbe blamelesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then at once euery man tooke downe his sacke to the grounde, and euery one opened his sacke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched, and began at the eldest and left at the yongest: and the cuppe was found in Beniamins sacke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they  rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Iudah and his brethren came to Iosephs house (for he was yet there) and they fel before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Ioseph sayd vnto them, What acte is this, which ye haue done? know ye not that such a man as I, can deuine and prophecie?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?  God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we, and [he] also with whom the cup is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he answered, God forbid, that I should doe so, but the man, with whome the cuppe is founde, he shalbe my seruant, and go ye in peace vnto your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou [art] even  as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My Lord asked his seruants, saying, Haue ye a father, or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we answered my Lorde, We haue a father that is olde, and a young childe, which he begate in his age: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loueth him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now thou saidest vnto thy seruants, Bring him vnto me, that I may set mine eye vpo him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we answered my lord, The childe can not depart from his father: for if he leaue his father, his father would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then saydest thou vnto thy seruants, Except your yonger brother come downe with you, looke in my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when we came vnto thy seruant our father, and shewed him what my lord had sayd,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father sayde vnto vs, Goe againe, bye vs a litle foode,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then we answered, We can not go downe: but if our yongest brother go with vs, then will we go downe: for we may not see the mans face, except our yongest brother be with vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my  wife bare me two [sons]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the one went out from me, and I said, Of a suretie he is torne in pieces, and I sawe him not since.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him,  ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nowe therefore, when I come to thy seruant my father, & the childe be not with vs (seeing that his life dependeth on the childes life)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then when hee shall see that the childe is not come, he will die: so shall thy seruants bring the graye head of thy seruant our father with sorowe to the graue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Doubtlesse thy seruant became suertie for the childe to my father, and said, If I bring him not vnto thee againe, then I will beare the blame vnto my father for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nowe therefore, I pray thee, let me thy seruant bide for the childe, as a seruant to my Lord, and let the childe go vp with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For  how shall I go up to my father, and the lad [be] not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
