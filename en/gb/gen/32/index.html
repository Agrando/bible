And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then thou shalt say, They be thy seruant Iaakobs: it is a present sent vnto my lord Esau: and beholde, he him selfe also is behinde vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So likewise commaunded he the seconde and the thirde, and all that followed the droues, saying, After this maner, ye shall speake vnto Esau, when ye finde him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I  will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So went the present before him: but he taried that night with the companie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he rose vp the same night, and tooke his two wiues, and his two maides, and his eleuen children, and went ouer the forde Iabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he tooke them, and sent them ouer the riuer, and sent ouer that he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a  man with him until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he saw that he  prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he saide, Let me goe, for the morning appeareth. Who answered, I will not let thee go except thou blesse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then said he vnto him, What is thy name? And he said, Iaakob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou  power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Iaakob demaded, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name; he said, Wherefore now doest thou aske my name? & he blessed him there</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Iaakob called the name of the place, Peniel: for, saide he, I haue seene God face to face, and my life is preserued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he  halted upon his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore the children of Israel eate not of the sinewe that shranke in the hollowe of the thigh, vnto this day: because he touched the sinew that shranke in the holow of Iaakobs thigh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
