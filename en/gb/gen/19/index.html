Who saide, Nay, but we will abide in the streete all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And  he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they  did eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young,  all the people from every quarter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who crying vnto Lot said to him, Where are the men, which came to thee this night? Bring them out vnto vs that we may knowe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Lot went out at the doore vnto them, and shut the doore after him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold now, I have two  daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing;  for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they said, Away hence, and they said, He is come alone as a stranger, and shall he iudge and rule? We will nowe deale worse with thee then with them. So they preassed sore vpon Lot himselfe, and came to breake the doore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the men put forth their hand and pulled Lot into the house to them & shut to ye doore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they smote the men that were at the doore of the house with blindnes both small and great, so that they were wearie in seeking the doore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the men said vnto Lot, Whom hast thou yet here? Either sonne in lawe, or thy sonnes, or thy daughters, or whatsoeuer thou hast in the citie, bring it out of this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For  we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Lot went out and spake vnto his sonnes in lawe, which maried his daughters, and said, Arise, get you out of this place: for the Lord will destroy the citie: but he seemed to his sonnes in lawe as though he had mocked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the morning arose, the Angels hasted Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be destroyed in the punishment of the citie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And while he  lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life;  look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Lot saide vnto them, Not so, I pray thee, my Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold now, thy seruant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercie, which thou hast shewed vnto me in sauing my life: and I cannot escape in the mountaine, least some euill take me, and I die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold now, this city [is] near to flee unto, and it [is] a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ([is] it not a  little one?) and my soul shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he said vnto him, Beholde, I haue receiued thy request also concerning this thing, that I will not ouerthrow this citie, for the which thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Haste thee, escape thither; for I  cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called  Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sunne did rise vpon the earth, when Lot entred into Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Lord rained vpon Sodom and vpon Gomorah brimstone, & fire from the Lord out of heauen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And ouerthrewe those cities and all the plaine, and all the inhabitants of the cities; and that that grewe vpon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a  pillar of salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham rising vp earely in ye morning went to the place, where he had stand before the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And looking towarde Sodom and Gomorah and toward all the land of the plaine, behold, he sawe the smoke of the lande mounting vp as the smoke of a fornace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But yet when God destroyed the cities of the plaine, God thought vpon Abraham, and sent Lot out from the middes of the destruction, when he ouerthrewe the cities, wherein Lot dwelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he  feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man in the  earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Come, let us make our father  drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they made their father drinke wine that night, and the elder went and lay with her father: but he perceiued not, neither whe she lay downe, neither when she rose vp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And on the morowe the elder saide to the yonger, Behold, yester night lay I with my father: let vs make him drinke wine this night also, and goe thou and lie with him, that we may preserue seede of our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they made their father drinke wine that night also, and the yonger arose, & lay with him, but he perceiued not, when she lay downe, neither when she rose vp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus were  both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same [is] the father of the  Moabites unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name  Benammi: the same [is] the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
