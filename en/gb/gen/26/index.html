And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the LORD appeared unto him, and said,  Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Dwell in this lande, and I will be with thee, and will blesse thee: for to thee, and to thy seede I will giue all these countreys: and I will performe the othe which I sware vnto Abraham thy father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Also I wil cause thy seede to multiply as the starres of heauen, and will giue vnto thy seede all these countreys: and in thy seede shall all the nanations of the earth be blessed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because that Abraham  obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Izhak dwelt in Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister:  for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [was]  sporting with Rebekah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abimelech called Izhak, and sayde, Loe, shee is of a suertie thy wife, and why saydest thou, She is my sister? To whom Izhak answered, Because I thought this, It may be that I shall dye for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought  guiltiness upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man, or his wife, shal die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Afterwarde Izhak sowed in that lande, and founde in the same yeere an hundreth folde by estimation: and so the Lord blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the man waxed mightie, and stil increased, till he was exceeding great,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines  envied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In so much that the Philistims stopped and filled vp with earth all the welles, which his fathers seruantes digged in his father Abrahams time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Abimelech sayde vnto Izhak, Get thee from vs, for thou art mightier then wee a great deale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the  valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Izhak returning, digged the welles of water, which they had digged in the dayes of Abraham his father: for the Philistims had stopped them after the death of Abraham, and hee gaue them the same names, which his father gaue them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Izhaks seruantes then digged in the valley, and found there a well of liuing water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the herdmen of Gerar did striue with Izhaks herdmen, saying, The water is ours: therefore called he the name of the wel Esek, because they were at strife with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Afterwarde they digged another well, and stroue for that also, and he called the name of it Sitnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he remoued thence, and digged an other well, for the which they stroue not: therefore called hee the name of it Rehoboth, and sayde, Because the Lorde hath nowe made vs roome, we shall increase vpon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he went vp thence to Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God  of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he builded an  altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came Abimelech to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friendes, and Phichol the captaine of his armie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To whom Izhak sayd, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate mee and haue put mee away from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Who answered, Wee sawe certainely that the Lorde was with thee, and wee thought thus, Let there be nowe an othe betweene vs, euen betweene vs and thee, and let vs make a couenant with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then hee made them a feast, and they dyd eate and drinke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they rose vp betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: then Izhak let them go, and they departed from him in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And that same day Izhaks seruantes came and tolde him of a well, which they had digged, and said vnto him, We haue found water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So hee called it Shibah: therefore the name of the citie is called Beer-sheba vnto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nowe when Esau was fourtie yeere olde, he tooke to wife Iudith, the daughter of Beeri an Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon an Hittite also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they were a griefe of minde to Izhak and to Rebekah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
