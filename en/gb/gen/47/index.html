And they answered Pharaoh, Thy seruants are shepheards, both we and our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They sayde moreouer vnto Pharaoh, For to soiourne in ye lande are we come: for thy seruants haue no pasture for their sheepe, so sore is ye famine in the lande of Canaan. Nowe therefore, we pray thee, let thy seruants dwel in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then spake Pharaoh to Ioseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The  land of Egypt [is] before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest [any] men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ioseph also brought Iaakob his father, and set him before Pharaoh; Iaakob saluted Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Pharaoh sayde vnto Iaakob, Howe olde art thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Iaakob sayd vnto Pharaoh, The whole time of my pilgrimage is an hundreth & thirty yeeres: fewe and euill haue the dayes of my life bene, and I haue not attayned vnto the yeeres of the life of my fathers, in the dayes of their pilgrimages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Iaakob tooke leaue of Pharaoh, & departed from the presence of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of  Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread,  according to [their] families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now there was no bread in all the land: for the famine was exceeding sore: so that the land of Egypt, and the land of Canaan were famished by reason of the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and  Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So when money fayled in the lande of Egypt, and in the lande of Canaan, then all the Egyptians came vnto Ioseph, and sayde, Giue vs bread: for why should we dye before thee? for our money is spent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then saide Ioseph, Bring your cattell, and I will giue you for your cattell, if your money be spent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they brought their cattell vnto Ioseph, and Ioseph gaue them bread for the horses, & for the flockes of sheepe, and for the heards of cattel, and for the asses: so he fed them with bread for all their cattell that yeere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But when the yeere was ended, they came vnto him the next yeere, and sayd vnto him, We will not hide from my lord, that since our money is spent, and my lord hath the heards of the cattel, there is nothing left in the sight of my lorde, but our bodies and our ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our  land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give [us] seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Ioseph bought all the lande of Egypt for Pharaoh: for the Egyptians solde euery man his ground because the famine was sore vpon the: so the land became Pharaohs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for the people, he  removed them to cities from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Onely the lande of the Priestes bought he not: for the Priestes had an ordinarie of Pharaoh, and they did eate their ordinarie, which Pharaoh gaue them: wherefore they solde not their grounde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ioseph sayd vnto the people, Behold, I haue bought you this daye, and your lande for Pharaoh: lo, here is seede for you: sowe therefore the grounde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And of the encrease ye shall giue the fifth part vnto Pharaoh, and foure partes shalbe yours for the seede of the fielde, and for your meate, and for them of your housholdes, and for your children to eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then they answered, Thou hast saued our liues: let vs finde grace in the sight of my Lorde, and we will be Pharaohs seruants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, [that] Pharaoh should have the fifth [part];  except the land of the priests only, [which] became not Pharaoh's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Israel dwelt in the lande of Egypt, in the countrey of Goshen: and they had their possessions therein, and grewe and multiplied exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Moreouer, Iaakob liued in the lande of Egypt seuenteene yeeres, so that the whole age of Iaakob was an hundreth fourtie and seuen yeere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now when the time drewe neere that Israel must dye, he called his sonne Ioseph, and sayde vnto him, If I haue nowe founde grace in thy sight, put thine hand nowe vnder my thigh, and deale mercifully & truely with me: burie me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But I will  lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel  bowed himself upon the bed's head.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
