And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in processe of time also the daughter of Shuah Iudahs wife dyed. Then Iudah, when he had left mourning, went vp to his sheepe sherers to Timnah, he, and his neighbour Hirah the Adullamite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was tolde Tamar, saying, beholde, thy father in lawe goeth vp to Timnah, to shere his sheepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then she put her widowes garments off from her, and couered her with a vaile, and wrapped her selfe, and sate downe in Pethah-enaim, which is by the way to Timnah, because she sawe that Shelah was growen, and she was not giuen vnto him to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Iudah sawe her, he iudged her an whore: for she had couered her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he  knew not that she [was] his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said he, I will sende thee a kid of the goates from the flocke; she said, Well, if thou wilt giue me a pledge, till thou sende it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he saide, What is the pledge that I shall giue thee? And she answered, Thy signet, and thy cloke, and thy staffe that is in thine hande. So he gaue it her, and lay by her, and she was with childe by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then she rose, and went and put her vaile from her and put on her widowes raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his  friend the Adullamite, to receive [his] pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then asked he the men of that place, saying, Where is ye whore, that sate in Enaim by the way side? And they answered, There was no whore here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He came therefore to Iudah againe, and said, I can not finde her, and also the men of the place said, There was no whore there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be  shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be  burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When she was brought foorth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, vnto whom these things pertaine, am I with childe: and saide also, Looke, I pray thee, whose these are, the seale, and the cloke, and the staffe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She hath been  more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again  no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now, when the time was come that she should be deliuered, beholde, there were twinnes in her wombe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when she was in trauell, the one put out his hand: and the midwife tooke and bound a red threde about his hand, saying, This is come out first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, as he  drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How  hast thou broken forth? [this] breach [be] upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And afterward came out his brother that had the red threde about his hande, and his name was called Zarah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
