into your hand are they delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every  moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoso sheddeth man's blood,  by man shall his blood be shed: for in the  image of God made he man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But bring ye forth fruite & multiplie: grow plentifully in the earth, and increase therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>God spake also to Noah & to his sonnes with him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I, behold, I establish my  covenant with you, and with your  seed after you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And with euery liuing creature that is with you, with the foule, with the cattell, and with euery beast of the earth with you, from all that goe out of the Arke, vnto euery beast of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And my couenant will I establish with you, that from henceforth all flesh shall not be rooted out by ye waters of the flood, neither shall there be a flood to destroy the earth any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then God saide, This is the token of the couenant which I make betweene me and you, and betweene euery liuing thing, that is with you vnto perpetuall generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I do set my  bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when I shall couer the earth with a cloud, and the bowe shall be seene in the cloude,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will remember my  covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore the bowe shalbe in the cloude, that I may see it, and remember the euerlasting couenant betweene God, and euery liuing thing in all flesh that is vpon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God said unto Noah,  This [is] the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that [is] upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Nowe the sonnes of Noah going foorth of the Arke, were Shem and Ham and Iapheth; Ham is the father of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These [are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth  overspread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Noah also began to be an husband man and planted a vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he drank of the wine, and was  drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Ham, the father of  Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and  told his two brethren without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then tooke Shem & Iapheth a garment, and put it vpon both their shoulders, and went backwarde, and couered the nakednesse of their father with their faces backwarde: so they sawe not their fathers nakednesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his yonger sonne had done vnto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said,  Cursed [be] Canaan; a  servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said moreouer, blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and let Canaan be his seruant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>God shall  enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
