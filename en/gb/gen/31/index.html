for he hath  sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all the riches, which God hath taken from our father, is ours and our childrens: nowe then whatsoeuer God hath saide vnto thee, doe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Iaakob rose vp, and set his sonnes and his wiues vpon camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he caried away all his flockes, & al his substance which he had gotten, to wit, his riches, which he had gotten in Padan Aram, to goe to Izhak his father vnto the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the  images that [were] her father's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus Iaakob stole away ye heart of Laban the Aramite: for he told him not that he fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So fled he with all that he had, and he rose vp, and passed the riuer, and set his face towarde mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the third day after was it told Laban, that Iaakob fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he tooke his brethren with him, & followed after him seuen dayes iourney, and ouertooke him at mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God came to Laban the Aramite in a dreame by night, and sayde vnto him, Take heede that thou speake not to Iaakob ought saue good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Laban ouertooke Iaakob, & Iaakob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban also with his brethren pitched vpon mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Laban sayde to Iaakob, What hast thou done? thou hast euen stolen away mine heart and caried away my daughters as though they had bene taken captiues with the sworde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherfore diddest thou flie so secretly and steale away from me, and diddest not tel me, that I might haue sent thee foorth with mirth & with songs, with timbrel and with harpe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But thou hast not suffered me to kisse my sonnes and my daughters: nowe thou hast done foolishly in doing so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the  God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nowe though thou wentest thy way, because thou greatly longedst after thy fathers house, yet wherefore hast thou stollen my gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Iaakob answered, and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, & thought that thou wouldest haue taken thy daughters from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But with whome thou findest thy gods, let him not liue. Search thou before our brethre what I haue of thine, & take it to thee, (but Iaakob wist not that Rahel had stolen them)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then came Laban into Iaakobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maides tentes, but founde them not. So hee went out of Leahs tent, and entred into Rahels tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>(Nowe Rahel had taken the idoles, & put them in the camels litter and sate downe vpon them) and Laban searched al the tent, but found them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then said she to her father, My Lord, be not angrie that I cannot rise vp before thee: for the custome of women is vpo me: so he searched, but found not the idoles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Iaakob was wroth, and chode with Laban: Iaakob also answered and sayd to Laban, What haue I trespassed? what haue I offended, that thou hast pursued after me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Seeing thou hast searched all my stuffe, what hast thou foud of all thine houshold stuffe? put it here before my brethren & thy brethren, that they may iudge betweene vs both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This twenty yere I haue bin with thee: thine ewes & thy goates haue not cast their yong, and the rammes of thy flocke haue I not eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Whatsoeuer was torne of beasts, I brought it not vnto thee, but made it good my selfe: of mine hand diddest thou require it, were it stollen by day or stollen by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I was in the day consumed with heate, and with frost in the night, and my sleepe departed from mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thus haue I bene twentie yeere in thine house, and serued thee fourteene yeeres for thy two daughters, and sixe yeeres for thy sheepe, and thou hast changed my wages tenne times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the  fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked [thee] yesternight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Laban answered, and saide vnto Iaakob, These daughters are my daughters, & these sonnes are my sonnes, and these sheepe are my sheepe, and all that thou seest, is mine, and what can I doe this day vnto these my daughters, or to their sonnes which they haue borne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now therefore  come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then tooke Iaakob a stone, and set it vp as a pillar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Iaakob sayde vnto his brethren, Gather stones: who brought stones, and made an heape, and they did eate there vpon the heape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it  Galeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For Laban sayd, This heape is witnesse betweene me and thee this day: therefore he called the name of it Galeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD  watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take [other]  wives beside my daughters, no man [is] with us; see, God [is] witness betwixt me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Moreouer Laban sayd to Iaakob, Beholde this heape, and behold the pillar, which I haue set betweene me and thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This heape shall be witnesse, and the pillar shall be witnesse, that I will not come ouer this heape to thee, and that thou shalt not passe ouer this heape and this pillar vnto me for euill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The God of Abraham, and the God of  Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the  fear of his father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then Iaakob did offer a sacrifice vpon the mount, and called his brethren to eate bread; they did eate bread, and taried all night in the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and  blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
