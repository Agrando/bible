And he said, Speak on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then he said, I am Abrahams seruant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD hath  blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Sarah my masters wife hath borne a sonne to my master, when she was olde, and vnto him hath he giuen all that he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And my master made me swear, saying,  Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But thou shalt go unto my  father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then I saide vnto my master, What if the woman will not followe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Who answered me, The Lord, before who I walke, will send his Angel with thee, and prosper thy iourney, and thou shalt take a wife for my sonne of my kinred and my fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shalt thou be clear from [this]  my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee [one], thou shalt be clear from my oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So I came this day to the well, and said, O Lorde, the God of my master Abraham, if thou nowe prosper my iourney which I goe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Behold, I stand by the wel of water: when a virgine commeth forth to drawe water, and I say to her, Giue me, I pray thee, a litle water of thy pitcher to drinke,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And she say to me, Drinke thou, and I will also drawe for thy camels, let her be ye wife, which the Lord hath prepared for my masters sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And before I had done speaking in mine  heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew [water]: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And she made haste, and tooke downe her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drinke, and I will giue thy camels drinke also. So I dranke, and she gaue the camels drinke also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she answered, The daughter of Bethuel Nahors sonne, whom Milcah bare vnto him. Then I put the abillement vpon her face, and the bracelets vpon her hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And now if ye will deal  kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the  right hand, or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said,  The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Beholde, Rebehak is before thee, take her and goe, that she may be thy masters sonnes wife, euen as the Lord hath said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And when Abrahams seruant heard their wordes, he bowed himselfe toward the earth vnto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then the seruant tooke foorth iewels of siluer, and iewels of golde, and raiment, and gaue to Rebekah: also vnto her brother and to her mother he gaue gifts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Afterward they did eate & drinke, both he, and the men that were with him, and taried all night; when they rose vp in the morning, he said, Let me depart vnto my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Then her brother and her mother answered, Let the maide abide with vs, at the least ten dayes: then shall she goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But he said vnto them, Hinder you me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my iourney: send me away, that I may goe to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at  her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they called Rebekah, and saide vnto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she answered, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So they let Rebekah their sister goe, & her nourse, with Abrahams seruant and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou [art] our sister, be thou [the mother] of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the  gate of those which hate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then Rebekah arose, & her maydes, and rode vpon the camels, and followed the man; the seruant tooke Rebekah, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Nowe Izhak came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi, (for he dwelt in the South countrey)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Isaac went out to  meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels [were] coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Also Rebekah lift vp her eyes, & when she saw Izhak, she lighted downe from the camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>(For shee had sayde to the seruant, Who is yonder man, that commeth in the fielde to meete vs? and the seruant had said, It is my master) So she tooke a vaile, and couered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And the seruant tolde Izhak all things, that he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Afterward Izhak brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and he tooke Rebekah, and she was his wife, and he loued her: So Izhak was comforted after his mothers death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
