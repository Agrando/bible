Joseph, [being] seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad [was] with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil  report.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Nowe Israel loued Ioseph more then all his sonnes, because he begate him in his old age, and he made him a coat of many colours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So when his brethren sawe that their father loued him more then all his brethren, then they hated him, and could not speake peaceably vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joseph  dreamed a dream, and he told [it] his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he saide vnto them, Heare, I pray you, this dreame which I haue dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beholde nowe, wee were binding sheues in the middes of the field: and loe, my shefe arose and also stoode vpright, and behold, your sheues compassed rounde about, and did reuerence to my shefe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they  hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Againe hee dreamed an other dreame, & tolde it his brethren, and saide, Behold, I haue had one dreame more, and beholde, the Sunne and the Moone & eleuen starres did reuerence to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he told [it] to his father, and to his brethren: and his father  rebuked him, and said unto him, What [is] this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his brethren envied him; but his father  observed the saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then his brethren went to keepe their fathers sheepe in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Israel said vnto Ioseph, Doe not thy brethren keepe in Shechem? Come and I will send thee to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he answered him, I am here. Then he saide vnto him, Goe now, see whether it bee well with thy brethren, and how the flocks prosper, and bring me word againe. So hee sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then a man found him: for lo, hee was wandring in the fielde, and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he answered, I seeke my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they keepe sheepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said, they are departed hece: for I heard them say, Let vs goe vnto Dothan. Then went Ioseph after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they  conspired against him to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For they sayd one to another, Behold, this dreamer commeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come now therefore, and let vs slay him, and cast him into some pitte, and wee will say, A wicked beast hath deuoured him: then wee shall see, what will come of his dreames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Reuben heard that, he deliuered him out of their handes, and saide, Let vs not kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also Reuben saide vnto them, Shed not blood, but cast him into this pitte that is in the wildernesse, and lay no hande vpon him. Thus he said, that he might deliuer him out of their hand, and restore him to his father againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when Ioseph was come vnto his brethren, they stript Ioseph out of his coate, his particoloured coate that was vpon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they took him, and cast  him into a pit: and the pit [was] empty, [there was] no water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then they sate them downe to eate bread: and they lift vp their eyes and looked, and behold, there came a companie of Ishmeelites from Gilead, and their camels laden with spicerie, and balme, and myrrhe, and were going to cary it downe into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Iudah said vnto his brethren, What auaileth it, if we slay our brother, though wee keepe his blood secret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Come and let vs sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our handes be vpon him: for he is our brother and our flesh: and his brethren obeyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the  Ishmeelites for twenty [pieces] of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Afterwarde Reuben returned to the pit, and beholde, Ioseph was not in the pit: then he rent his clothes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And returned to his brethren, and said, The childe is not yonder, and I, whither shall I goe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they tooke Iosephs coate, and killed a kidde of the goates, and dipped the coate in the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they sent the coat of [many] colours,  and they brought [it] to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it [be] thy son's coat or no.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then he knewe it and said, It is my sonnes coate: a wicked beast hath deuoured him: Ioseph is surely torne in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Iaakob rent his clothes, & put sackecloth about his loynes, and sorowed for his sonne a long season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then all his sonnes and all his daughters rose vp to comfort him, but he woulde not be comforted, but said, Surely I will go downe into the graue vnto my sonne mourning: so his father wept for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an  officer of Pharaoh's, [and] captain of the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
