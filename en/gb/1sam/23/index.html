And the Lord answered Dauid, Go and smite the Philistims, and saue Keilah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in  Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Dauid asked counsell of the Lord againe; the Lord answered him, & sayd, Arise, go downe to Keilah: for I wil deliuer the Philistims into thine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Dauid and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistims, & brought away their cattel, & smote them with a great slaughter: thus Dauid saued the inhabitants of Keilah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, [that] he came down [with] an  ephod in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was tolde Saul that Dauid was come to Keilah, & Saul sayd, God hath deliuered him into mine hand: for he is shut in, seeing he is come into a citie that hath gates and barres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Saul called all the people together to warre, for to go downe to Keilah, & to besiege Dauid and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest,  Bring hither the ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then sayde Dauid, O Lord God of Israel, thy seruat hath heard, that Saul is about to come to Keilah to destroy the citie for my sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wil the lordes of Keilah deliuer me vp into his hand? and will Saul come downe, as thy seruant hath heard?

And the Lord sayde, They will deliuer thee vp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Dauid and his men, which were about sixe hundreth, arose, & departed out of Keilah, and went whither they coulde; it was tolde Saul, that Dauid was fled from Keilah, and he left off his iourney.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God  delivered him not into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Dauid sawe that Saul was come out for to seeke his life: and Dauid was in the wildernes of Ziph in the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ionathan Sauls sonne arose and went to Dauid into the wood, and comforted him in God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be  king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So they twaine made a couenant before ye Lorde: and Dauid did remaine in the wood: but Ionathan went to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came vp the Ziphims to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doeth not Dauid hide himselfe by vs in holdes, in the wood in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the right side of Ieshimon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nowe therefore, O King, come downe according to all that thine heart can desire, and our part shall be to deliuer him into the Kinges handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said,  Blessed [be] ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Goe, I pray you, & prepare ye yet better: know and see his place where he haunteth, and who hath seene him there: for it is sayd to me, He is subtile, and craftie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the  land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they arose and went to Ziph before Saul, but Dauid and his men were in the wildernesse of Maon, in the playne on the right hande of Ieshimon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Saul also and his men went to seek [him]. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of  Maon.
