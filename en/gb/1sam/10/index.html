Tary for me seuen dayes, till I come to thee and shewe thee what thou shalt doe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it was [so], that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another  heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they came thither to the hill, beholde, the companie of Prophets meete him, and the Spirit of God came vpon him, & he prophecied among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore all the people that knewe him before, when they saw that he prophecied among the Prophets, saide eche to other, What is come vnto the sonne of Kish? is Saul also among the Prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one of the same place answered and said, But who [is] their  father? Therefore it became a proverb, [Is] Saul also among the  prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he had made an ende of prophecying, he came to the hie place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Sauls vncle saide vnto him, and to his seruant, Whither went ye? And he saide, To seeke the asses: and when we sawe that they were no where, we came to Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Sauls vncle saide, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Saul saide to his vncle, He tolde vs plainely that the asses were founde: but concerning the kingdome whereof Samuel spake, tolde he him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel  called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he saide vnto the children of Israel, Thus saith ye Lord God of Israel, I haue brought Israel out of Egypt, and deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the handes of all kingdomes that troubled you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But ye haue this day cast away your God, who onely deliuereth you out of all your aduersities and tribulations: and ye said vnto him, No, but appoint a King ouer vs. Nowe therefore stand ye before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was  taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Afterwarde he assembled the tribe of Beniamin according to their families, and the familie of Matri was taken. So Saul the sonne of Kish was taken, and when they sought him, he coulde not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he  hath hid himself among the stuff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they ranne, and brought him thence: and when he stoode among the people, he was hier then any of the people from the shoulders vpwarde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Samuel saide to all the people, See ye not him, whom the Lorde hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? and all the people shouted and saide, God saue the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Samuel told the people  the manner of the kingdom, and wrote [it] in a book, and laid [it] up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Saul also went home to Gibeah, and there followed him a bande of men, whose heart God had touched,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he  held his peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
