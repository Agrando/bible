So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Saul smote the Amalekites from Hauilah as thou commest to Shur, that is before Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And tooke Agag the King of the Amalekites aliue, and destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the better sheepe, and the oxen, and the fat beasts, and the lambes, and all that was good, and they would not destroy them: but euery thing that was vile and nought worth, that they destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then came the worde of the Lord vnto Samuel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It  repenteth me that I have set up Saul [to be] king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Samuel arose early to meete Saul in the morning, one tolde Samuel, saying, Saul is gone to Carmel: and beholde, he hath made him there a place, from whence he returned, and departed, and is gone downe to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD: I have performed the  commandment of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Samuel saide, What meaneth then the bleating of the sheepe in mine eares, and the lowing of the oxen which I heare?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul answered, They haue brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheepe, and of the oxen to sacrifice them vnto the Lorde thy God, and the remnant haue we destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Againe Samuel saide to Saul, Let me tell thee what the Lord hath saide to me this night; he said vnto him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, When thou [wast]  little in thine own sight, [wast] thou not [made] the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Lord sent thee on a iourney, and saide, Goe, and destroy those sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them, vntill thou destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nowe wherefore hast thou not obeyed the voyce of the Lorde, but hast turned to the pray, and hast done wickedly in the sight of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea,  I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people tooke of the spoyle, sheepe, and oxen, and the chiefest of the things which shoulde haue bene destroyed, to offer vnto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel saide, Hath the Lord as great pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obeyed? Beholde, to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken is better then the fatte of rammes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For  rebellion [is as] the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness [is as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from [being] king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Saul sayde vnto Samuel, I haue sinned: for I haue transgressed the commaundement of the Lord, and thy wordes, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voyce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my  sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Samuel saide vnto Saul, I will not returne with thee: for thou hast cast away the word of the Lorde, and the Lorde hath cast away thee, that thou shalt not be King ouer Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned himselfe to goe away, he caught the lappe of his coate, and it rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a  neighbour of thine, [that is] better than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the  Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he [is] not a man, that he should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he saide, I haue sinned: but honour mee, I pray thee, before the Elders of my people, and before Israel, and turne againe with mee, that I may worship the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned againe, and followed Saul: and Saul worshipped the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the  bitterness of death is past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel sayde, As thy sworde hath made women childlesse, so shall thy mother bee childelesse among other women; Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel went to  Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel came no more to  see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD  repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
