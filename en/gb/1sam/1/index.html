And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, [were] there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And on a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, he gaue to Peninnah his wife and to all her sonnes and daughters portions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy  portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her aduersarie vexed her sore, forasmuch as she vpbraided her, because the Lorde had made her barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>(And so did he yeere by yeere) and as oft as she went vp to the house of the Lord, thus she vexed her, that she wept and did not eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? [am] not I better to thee than ten  sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the  temple of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she was troubled in her minde, and prayed vnto the Lord, and wept sore:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Also she vowed a vowe, and sayd, O Lord of hostes, if thou wilt looke on the trouble of thine handmaide, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaide, but giue vnto thine handmaide a manchilde, then I will giue him vnto the Lord all the dayes of his life, and there shall no rasor come vpon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as she continued praying before the Lord, Eli marked her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For Hannah spake in her heart: her lips did moue onely, but her voyce was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had bene drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli sayde vnto her, Howe long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy drunkennesse from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Hannah answered and sayd, Nay my lord, but I am a woman troubled in spirit: I haue drunke neither wine nor strong drinke, but haue powred out my soule before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Count not thine handmaide for a wicked woman: for of the abundance of my complaint and my griefe haue I spoken hitherto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered, and sayd, Go in peace, and the God of Israel graunt thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let thine handmaid find  grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more [sad].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD  remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For in processe of time Hannah conceiued, and bare a sonne, and she called his name Samuel, Because, said she, I haue asked him of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man  Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah went not vp: for she sayd vnto her husband, I will tarie vntill the childe be weined, then I will bring him that hee may appeare before the Lord, and there abide for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his  word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weined him, she tooke him with her with three bullockes and an Ephah of floure and a bottell of wine, and brought him vnto the house of the Lorde in Shiloh, and the childe was yong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they slewe a bullocke, and brought the childe to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy  soul liveth, my lord, I [am] the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I prayed for this childe, and the Lord hath giuen me my desire which I asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he  worshipped the LORD there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
