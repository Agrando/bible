He will not doe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly [as] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, [there is] but a  step between me and death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said Ionathan vnto Dauid, Whatsoeuer thy soule requireth, that I wil do vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow [is] the  new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third [day] at even.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked [leave] of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for [there is] a  yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if he say thus, It is well, thy seruant shall haue peace: but if he be angrie, be sure that wickednesse is concluded of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So shalt thou shew mercy vnto thy seruant: for thou hast ioyned thy seruant into a couenant of the Lord with thee, and if there be in me iniquitie, slay thou me: for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were  determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said David to Jonathan, Who  shall tell me? or what [if] thy father answer thee roughly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Ionathan sayde to Dauid, Come and let vs goe out into the fielde: and they twaine went out into the fielde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Ionathan sayde to Dauid, O Lorde God of Israel, when I haue groped my fathers minde to morow at this time, or within this three dayes, and if it be well with Dauid, and I then send not vnto thee, and shewe it thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD  do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father [to do] thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD,  that I die not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I require that thou cut not off thy mercie from mine house for euer: no, not when the Lorde hath destroyed the enemies of Dauid, euery one from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Ionathan made a bond with the house of Dauid, saying, Let the Lorde require it at the hands of Dauids enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And againe Ionathan sware vnto Dauid, because he loued him (for he loued him as his owne soule)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said Ionathan to him, To morowe is the first day of the moneth: and thou shalt be looked for, for thy place shalbe emptie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thou shalt hide thy selfe three dayes, then thou shalt goe downe quickely and come to the place where thou diddest hide thy selfe, when this matter was in hand, and shalt remayne by the stone Ezel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will shoote three arrowes on the side thereof, as though I shot at a marke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And after I wil sende a boy, saying, Goe, seeke the arrowes. If I say vnto the boy, See, the arrowes are on this side thee, bring them, & come thou: for it is well with thee and no hurt, as the Lord liueth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond thee; go thy way: for the  LORD hath sent thee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As touching the thing which thou and I haue spoken of, beholde, the Lorde be betweene thee and me for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Dauid hid him selfe in the field: and when the first day of the moneth came, the King sate to eate meate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the King sate, as at other times vpon his seate, euen vpon his seate by the wall: and Ionathan arose, and Abner sate by Sauls side, but Dauids place was emptie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he [is] not  clean; surely he [is] not clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, [which was] the second [day] of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not  the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Ionathan answered vnto Saul, Dauid required of me, that he might goe to Beth-lehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me [to be there]: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my  brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou  son of the perverse rebellious [woman], do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For as long as the sonne of Ishai liueth vpon the earth, thou shalt not be stablished, nor thy kingdome: wherefore now send and fet him vnto me, for he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be  slain? what hath he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul cast a speare at him to hit him, whereby Ionathan knew, that it was determined of his father to slay Dauid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Ionathan arose from the table in a great anger, and did eate no meate the seconde day of the moneth: for he was sorie for Dauid, and because his father had reuiled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field  at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he saide vnto his boy, Runne now, seeke the arrowes which I shoote, and as the boy ran, he shot an arrowe beyond him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when the boy was come to the place where the arrowe was that Ionathan had shot, Ionathan cryed after the boy, and sayde, Is not the arrowe beyond thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jonathan cried after the lad,  Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the boy knewe nothing: onely Ionathan and Dauid knew the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then Ionathan gaue his bowe and arrowes vnto the boy that was with him, and sayd vnto him, Goe, carrie them into the citie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>[And] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the  south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have  sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
