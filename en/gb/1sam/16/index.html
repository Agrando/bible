And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come  to sacrifice to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And call Ishai to the sacrifice, and I will shewe thee what thou shalt doe, and thou shalt anoynt vnto me him whom I name vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town  trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he answeared, Yea: I am come to doe sacrifice vnto the Lorde: sanctifie your selues, and come with me to the sacrifice; he sanctified Ishai & his sonnes, & called them to the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S  anointed [is] before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the Lord said vnto Samuel, Looke not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature, because I haue refused him: for God seeth not as man seeth: for ma looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Ishai called Abinadab, & made him come before Samuel; he saide, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Ishai made Shammah come; he said, Neither yet hath the Lorde chosen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Againe Ishai made his seue sonnes to come before Samuel: and Samuel saide vnto Ishai, The Lord hath chosen none of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally, Samuel said vnto Ishai, Are there no more children but these? And hee sayde, There remaineth yet a litle one behinde, that keepeth the sheepe. Then Samuel saide vnto Ishai, Sende and set him: for we will not sit downe, till he be come hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sent, and brought him in: and he was ruddie, & of a good countenance, and comely visage; the Lorde saide, Arise, and anoynt him: for this is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Samuel tooke the horne of oyle, and anoynted him in the middes of his brethren; the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Dauid, from that day forwarde: then Samuel rose vp, and went to Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an  evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Sauls seruants said vnto him, Beholde nowe, the euill spirite of God vexeth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let our Lord therefore command thy seruants, that are before thee, to seeke a man that is a cunning plaier vpon the harpe: that when the euil spirit of God commeth vpon thee, hee may play with his hand, and thou maiest be eased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Saul then saide vnto his seruantes, Prouide me a man, I pray you, that can play well, & bring him to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a  son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, [that is] cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD [is] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore Saul sent messengers vnto Ishai, and said, Send me Dauid thy sonne which is with the sheepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ishai tooke an asse laden with breade and a flagon of wine and a kidde, and sent them by the hand of Dauid his sonne vnto Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Dauid came to Saul, and stoode before him: and he loued him verie well, and he was his armour bearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul sent to Ishai, saying, Let Dauid nowe remaine with me: for he hath found fauour in my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was  refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
