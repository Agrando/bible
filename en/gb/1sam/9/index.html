And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go  seek the asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So he passed through mount Ephraim, and went through the lande of Shalishah, but they found them not. Then they went through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: he went also through ye land of Iemini, but they found the not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[And] when they were come to the land of  Zuph, Saul said to his servant that [was] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave [caring] for the asses, and take thought for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said vnto him, Behold nowe, in this citie is a man of God, and he is an honorable man: all that he saith commeth to passe: let vs nowe goe thither, if so be that he can shewe vs what way we may goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then saide Saul to his seruant, Well then, let vs goe: but what shall we bring vnto the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is no present to bring to the man of God: what haue we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a  shekel of silver: [that] will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the  seer: for [he that is] now [called] a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then saide Saul to his seruant, Well saide, come, let vs goe: so they went into the citie where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as they were going vp the hie way to the citie, they found maydes that came out to draw water, & said vnto them, Is there here a Seer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for [there is] a  sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth  bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then they went vp into the citie, & when they were come into the middes of the citie, Samuel came out against them, to goe vp to the hie place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord had reueiled to Samuel secretly (a day before Saul came) saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him [to be] captain over my people Israel, that he may  save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Samuel therefore sawe Saul, the Lord answered him, See, this is the man whom I spake to thee of, he shall rule my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then went Saul to Samuel in the middes of the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the Seers house is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I [am] the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that [is] in thine  heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And  on whom [is] all the desire of Israel? [Is it] not on thee, and on all thy father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Saul answered, and said, Am not I the sonne of Iemini of the smallest tribe of Israel? and my familie is the least of all the families of the tribe of Beniamin. Wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the  parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which [were] about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel saide vnto the cooke, Bring foorth the portion which I gaue thee, and whereof I said vnto thee, Keepe it with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the shoulder, and [that] which [was]  upon it, and set [it] before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Behold that which is left! set [it] before thee, [and] eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I  have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they were come downe from the hie place into the citie, he communed with Saul vpon the top of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the  top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>[And] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee  the word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
