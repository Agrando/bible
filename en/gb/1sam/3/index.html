And the word of the LORD was  precious in those days; [there was] no open vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli [was] laid down in his  place, and his eyes began to wax dim, [that] he could not see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And ere the  lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was], and Samuel was laid down [to sleep];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That the LORD  called Samuel: and he answered, Here [am] I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he ranne vnto Eli, and said, Here am I, for thou calledst me. But he said, I called thee not: goe againe and sleepe; he went and slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lorde called once againe, Samuel; Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and said, I am here: for thou diddest call me; he answered, I called thee not, my sonne: go againe and sleepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Samuel did not yet know  the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli  perceived that the LORD had called the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore Eli saide vnto Samuel, Goe and sleepe: and if he call thee, then say, Speake Lorde, for thy seruant heareth. So Samuel went, and slept in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Lord came, and stoode, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speake, for thy seruant heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall  tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day I will raise vp against Eli all things which I haue spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an ende.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I haue tolde him that I will iudge his house for euer, for the iniquitie which hee knoweth, because his sonnes ranne into a slaunder, and he stayed them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for  ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Afterward Samuel slept vntil the morning, and opened the doores of the house of the Lord, and Samuel feared to shewe Eli the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel my sonne; he answered, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, What [is] the thing that [the LORD] hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide [it] not from me: God  do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide [any] thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Samuel tolde him euery whit, and hid nothing from him. Then hee said, It is the Lorde: let him do what seemeth him good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words  fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all Israel fro Dan to Beer-sheba knew that faithfull Samuel was the Lordes Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lorde appeared againe in Shiloh: for the Lorde reueiled himselfe to Samuel in Shiloh by his word.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
