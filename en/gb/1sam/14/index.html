But he told not his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Saul taried in the border of Gibeah vnder a pomegranate tree, which was in Migron, and the people that were with him, were about sixe hundreth men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Ahiah the sonne of Ahitub, Ichabods brother, the sonne of Phinehas, the sonne of Eli, was the Lordes Priest in Shiloh, and ware an Ephod: and the people knewe not that Ionathan was gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nowe in the way whereby Ionathan sought to go ouer to the Philistims garison, there was a sharpe rocke on the one side, and a sharpe rocke on the other side: the name of the one was called Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The one rocke stretched from the North towarde Michmash, and the other was from the South toward Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these  uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for [there is] no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that [is] in thine heart: turn thee; behold,  I [am] with thee according to thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Ionathan, Beholde, we goe ouer vnto those men, and will shewe our selues vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if they say, Come vp vnto vs, then we will goe vp: for the Lorde hath deliuered them into our hande: and this shall be a signe vnto vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the  holes where they had hid themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men of the garison answered Ionathan, and his armour bearer, and said, Come vp to vs: for we will shewe you a thing. Then Ionathan said vnto his armour bearer, Come vp after me: for the Lorde hath deliuered them into the hand of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jonathan climbed up upon  his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And that  first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, [which] a yoke [of oxen might plow].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth  quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Beniamin sawe: and beholde, the multitude was discomfited, and smitten as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore saide Saul vnto the people that were with him, Search nowe and see, who is gone from vs; when they had nombred, beholde, Ionathan and his armour bearer were not there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul said vnto Ahiah, Bring hither the Arke of God (for the Arke of God was at that time with the children of Israel)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that [was] in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest,  Withdraw thine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul was assembled with all the people that were with him, and they came to the battell: and behold, euery mans sworde was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moreover the Hebrews [that] were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp [from the country] round about, even they also [turned] to be with the  Israelites that [were] with Saul and Jonathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also all the men of Israel which had hid themselues in mount Ephraim, when they heard, that the Philistims were fled, they followed after them in the battell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And so the Lord saued Israel that day: and the battell continued vnto Beth-auen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying,  Cursed [be] the man that eateth [any] food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted [any] food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all they of the land came to a wood, where hony lay vpon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the  oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that [was] in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his  eyes were enlightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father made the people to sweare, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth sustenance this day: and the people were faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then said Jonathan, My father hath  troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Howe much more, if the people had eaten to day of the spoyle of their enemies which they found? for had there not bene nowe a greater slaughter among the Philistims?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they smote the Philistims that day, from Michmash to Aiialon: and the people were exceeding faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the people turned to the spoile, & tooke sheepe, and oxen, and calues, and slewe them on the ground, and the people did eate them with the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed:  roll a great stone unto me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Againe Saul said, Goe abroade among the people, and bid them bring me euery man his oxe, and euery man his sheepe, and slay them here, and eate and sinne not against the Lord in eating with the blood; ye people brought euery man his oxe in his hand that night, & slew them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Saul made an altar vnto the Lorde, and that was the first altar that he made vnto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us  draw near hither unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So Saul asked of God, saying, Shall I goe downe after ye Philistims? wilt thou deliuer them into the hands of Israel? But he answered him not at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul said, All ye chiefe of the people, come ye hither, and knowe, and see by whom this sinne is done this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For as the Lord liueth, which saueth Israel, though it be done by Ionathan my sonne, he shall dye the death. But none of all the people answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he saide vnto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Ionathan my sonne will be on the other side; the people saide vnto Saul, Doe what thou thinkest best.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give  a perfect [lot]. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Saul saide, Cast lot betweene me and Ionathan my sonne; Ionathan was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Saul said to Ionathan, Tell me what thou hast done; Ionathan tolde him, & said, I tasted a litle hony with the ende of the rod, that was in mine hand, and loe, I must die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Againe Saul answered, God doe so & more also, vnlesse thou die the death, Ionathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the people said unto Saul,  Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: [as] the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Saul came vp from the Philistims: and the Philistims went to their owne place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So Saul helde the kingdome ouer Israel, and fought against all his enemies on euery side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the Kings of Zobah, and against the Philistims: and whithersoeuer he went, he handled them as wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he gathered an host, and smote the  Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan,  and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters [were these]; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger  Michal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the name of Saul's wife [was] Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host [was]  Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Kish was Sauls father: and Ner the father of Abner was the sonne of Abiel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:  and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
