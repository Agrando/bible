And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake [them], and without fail  recover [all].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Dauid and the sixe hundreth men that were with him, went, and came to the riuer Besor, where a part of them abode:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Dauid and foure hundreth men followed (for two hundreth abode behinde, being too wearie to goe ouer the riuer Besor)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him  bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Also they gaue him a fewe figges, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirite came againe to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunke any water in three dayes, and three nightes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Dauid saide vnto him, To whome belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he saide, I am a yong man of Egypt, and seruant to an Amalekite: and my master left me three dayes agoe, because I fell sicke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We roued vpon the South of Chereth, & vpon the coast belonging to Iudah, and vpon the South of Caleb, and we burnt Ziklag with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said,  Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when he had brought him down, behold, [they were] spread abroad upon all the earth,  eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening  of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Dauid recouered all that the Amalekites had taken: also Dauid rescued his two wiues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they lacked nothing, small or great, sonne or daughter, or of the spoyle of all that they had taken away: Dauid recouered them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drave before those [other] cattle, and said, This [is] David's  spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Dauid came to the two hundreth men that were too wearie for to followe Dauid: whome they had made also to abide at the riuer Besor: and they came to meete Dauid, and to meete the people that were with him: so when Dauid came neere to the people, hee saluted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then answered all the wicked men and [men] of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them [ought] of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his  wife and his children, that they may lead [them] away, and depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then saide Dauid, Yee shall not doe so, my brethren, with that which the Lorde hath giuen vs, who hath preserued vs, and deliuered the companie that came against vs, into our handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For who will obey you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth downe to the battel, so shall his part be, that tarieth by the stuffe: they shal part alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was [so] from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Dauid therefore came to Ziklag, he sent of the pray vnto the Elders of Iudah and to his friends, saying, See there is a blessing for you of the spoyle of the enemies of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Hee sent to them of Beth-el, and to them of South Ramoth, and to them of Iattir,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And to them of Aroer, and to them of Siphmoth, and to them of Eshtemoa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And to them of Rachal, and to them of the cities of the Ierahmeelites, and to them of the cities of the Kenites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And to them of Hormah, and to them of Chor-ashan, and to them of Athach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And to [them] which [were] in Hebron, and  to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
