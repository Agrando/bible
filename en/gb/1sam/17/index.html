And Saul said unto David,  Go, and the LORD be with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul put his rayment vpon Dauid, & put an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and put a brigandine vpon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then girded Dauid his sword vpon his rayment, and began to go: for he neuer proued it: and Dauid sayde vnto Saul, I can not goe with these: for I am not accustomed. wherefore Dauid put them off him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he took his  staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling [was] in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the Philistim came and drew neere vnto Dauid, and the man that bare the shielde went before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now when the Philistim looked about & saw Dauid, he disdeined him: for he was but yong, ruddie, and of a comely face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the Philistine said unto David, [Am] I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine  cursed David by his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Philistim sayd to Dauid, Come to me, & I will giue thy flesh vnto the foules of the heauen, and to the beastes of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then sayd Dauid to the Philistim, Thou commest to me with a sword, and with a speare, & with a shield, but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of hostes, the God of the hoste of Israel, whom thou hast rayled vpon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This  day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that all this assembly may know, that the Lord saueth not with sworde nor with speare (for the battel is the Lords) and he will giue you into our handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David  hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Dauid put his hande in his bagge, and tooke out a stone, and slang it, & smote the Philistim in his forehead, that the stone sticked in his forehead, and he fell groueling to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So Dauid ouercame the Philistim with a sling & with a stone, & smote the Philistim, and slew him, when Dauid had no sword in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then Dauid ranne, & stood vpon the Philistim, and tooke his sword and drew it out of his sheath, and slewe him, and cut off his head therewith. So whe the Philistims saw, that their champion was dead, they fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the men of Israel and Iudah arose, & shouted, and followed after the Philistims, vntill they came to the valley, & vnto the gates of Ekron: and the Philistims fell downe wounded by the way of Shaaraim, euen to Gath & to Ekron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the children of Israel returned from pursuing the Philistims, & spoyled their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Dauid tooke the head of ye Philistim, and brought it to Ierusalem, and put his armour in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner,  whose son [is] this youth? And Abner said, [As] thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then the King sayde, Enquire thou whose sonne this yong man is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Philistim, then Abner tooke him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistim in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Saul sayde to him, Whose sonne art thou, thou yong man? And Dauid answered, I am the sonne of thy seruant Ishai the Bethlehemite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
