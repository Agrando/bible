And Saul blew the  trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And al Israel heard say, Saul hath destroied a garison of the Philistims: wherefore Israel was had in abomination with the Philistims: and the people gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which [is] on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from  Bethaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were in distresse ) the people hid themselues in caues, and in holdes, and in rockes, and in towres, and in pittes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And [some of] the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of  Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he [was] yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed]: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were  scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Saul sayde, Bring a burnt offering to me and peace offrings: and he offered a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And assoone as hee had made an ende of offering the burnt offering, beholde, Samuel came: and Saul went foorth to meete him, to salute him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were  scattered from me, and [that] thou camest not within the days appointed, and [that] the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore said I, The Philistims will come downe nowe vpon me to Gilgal, and I haue not made supplication vnto the Lorde. I was bolde therefore and offred a burnt offring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy  God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a  man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him [to be] captain over his people, because thou hast not kept [that] which the LORD commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto  Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people [that were] present with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul and Ionathan his sonne, and the people that were found with them, had their abiding in Gibeah of Beniamin: but the Philistims pitched in Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there came out of the hoste of the Philistims three bandes to destroie, one bande turned vnto the way of Ophrah vnto the lande of Shual,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another company turned the way [to] Bethhoron: and  another company turned [to] the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then there was no smith founde throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistims sayde, Lest the Ebrewes make them swordes or speares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore all ye Israelites went downe to the Philistims, to sharpen euery man his share, his mattocke, and his axe, and his weeding hooke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet they had a file for the shares, and for the mattockes, and for the picke forkes, and for the axes, and for to sharpen the goades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither  sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that [were] with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the garison of the Philistims came out to the passage of Michmash.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
