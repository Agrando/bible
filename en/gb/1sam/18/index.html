But Dauid auoyded twise out of his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul was afrayd of Dauid, because the Lord was with him, & was departed from Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went  out and came in before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Dauid behaued himselfe wisely in all his wayes: for the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherefore when Saul saw that he was very wise, he was afrayde of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all Israel and Iudah loued Dauid, because he went out and in before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and  fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Dauid answered Saul, What am I? and what is my life, or the family of my father in Israel, that I should be sonne in law to the King?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that  she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Michal Sauls daughter loued Dauid: & they shewed Saul, & the thing pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a  snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in [the one of] the twain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul commanded his seruants, Speake with Dauid secretly, & say, Behold, ye King hath a fauour to thee, and all his seruants loue thee: be now therefore the Kings sonne in law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said,  Seemeth it to you [a] light [thing] to be a king's son in law, seeing that I [am] a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And then Sauls seruats brought him word againe, saying, Such wordes spake Dauid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Saul sayd, This wise shal ye say to Dauid, The King desireth no dowrie, but an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistims, to bee auenged of the Kings enemies: for Saul thought to make Dauid fall into the handes of the Philistims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the  king's son in law: and the days were not expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and  they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Saul sawe, and vnderstoode that the Lord was with Dauid, & that Michal the daughter of Saul loued him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Saul was yet the more afraid  of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, [that]  David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
