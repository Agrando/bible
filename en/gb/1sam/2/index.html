And the child did minister unto the  LORD before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial; they  knew not the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the Priestes custome towarde the people was this: when any man offered sacrifice, the Priestes boy came, while the flesh was seething, and a fleshhooke with three teeth, in his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he struck [it] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;  all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also before they burnt the  fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And [if] any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and [then] take [as much] as thy soul  desireth; then he would answer him, [Nay]; but thou shalt give [it me] now: and if not, I will take [it] by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men  abhorred the offering of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Samuel being a yong childe ministred before the Lord, girded with a linen Ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And his mother made him a litle coat, and brought it to him from yeere to yeere, when she came vp with her husband, to offer the yerely sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord giue thee seede of this woman, for the petition that she asked of the Lord: and they departed vnto their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lorde visited Hannah, so that she conceiued, & bare three sonnes, & two daughters; the childe Samuel grewe before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that  assembled [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And hee saide vnto them, Why doe ye such things? For of all this people I heare euill reportes of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nay, my sons; for [it is] no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to  transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?
