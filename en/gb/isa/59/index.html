When the enemy shall  come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to  them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As for me, this [is] my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that [is] upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,  shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
