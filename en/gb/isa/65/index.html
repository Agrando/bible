These [are] a smoke in my nose, a fire that  burneth all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, [it is]  written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers  together, saith the LORD, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and [one] saith, Destroy it not; for a  blessing [is] in it: so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I will bring a seede out of Iaakob, and out of Iudah, that shal inherit my mountaine: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my seruants shall dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And  Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But ye [are] they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that  troop, and that furnish the drink offering to that number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore will I  number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I  spoke, ye did not hear; but did evil before my eyes, and did choose [that] in which I delighted not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall  eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Beholde, my seruants shal sing for ioye of heart, and ye shal crye for sorow of heart, and shal howle for vexation of minde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my  chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by  another name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That he who blesseth himself in the  earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former  troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I create  new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be you glad and reioyce for euer in the things that I shall create: for beholde, I will create Ierusalem, as a reioycing and her people as a ioye,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I wil reioyce in Ierusalem, and ioye in my people, and the voyce of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voyce of crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There shall be no more from there an infant of days, nor an old man that hath  not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner [being]  an hundred years old shall be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they shall  build houses, and inhabit [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall not build, and another inhabite: they shall not plant, and another eate: for as the dayes of the tree are the dayes of my people, and mine elect shall inioye in olde age the worke of their handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not labour in vaine, nor bring forth in feare: for they are the seede of the blessed of the Lord, and their buds with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yea, before they call, I will answere, and whiles they speake, I will heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The  wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox: and dust [shall be] the serpent's food.
