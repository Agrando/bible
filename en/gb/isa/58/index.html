[why] have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find  pleasure, and exact all your labours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as [ye do this] day, to make your voice to be  heard on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is it such a fast that I haue chosen, that a man should afflict his soule for a day, and to bowe downe his head, as a bull rush, and to lie downe in sackecloth and ashes? wilt thou call this a fasting, or an acceptable day to the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[Is] not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every  yoke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[Is it] not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou shouldest bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou shouldest cover him; and that thou shouldest not hide thyself from  thy own flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then shall thy  light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily: and thy  righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rear guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I [am].
