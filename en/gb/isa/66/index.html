Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I also will  choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose [that] in which I delighted not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his  word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Before  she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a male child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one  day? [or] shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I  bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut [the womb]? saith thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Reioyce ye with Ierusalem, and be gladde with her, all ye that loue her: reioyce for ioy with her, all ye that mourne for her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That ye may nurse,  and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may draw milk, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend  peace to her like a river, and the glory of the  Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye be nursed, ye shall be  borne upon [her] sides, and be dandled upon [her] knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Ierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when ye see [this], your heart shall rejoice, and your  bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and [his] indignation toward his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to  render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord will iudge with fire, and with his sworde all flesh, and the slaine of the Lorde shall be many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They that sanctify  themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one [tree] in the midst, eating  swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I [know] their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my  glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will set a  sign among them, and I will send those that  escape of them to the nations, [to]  Tarshish,  Pul, and  Lud, that draw the  bow, [to]  Tubal, and  Javan, [to] the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and  they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they shall bring all your  brethren [for] an offering to the LORD out of all nations upon  horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will also take of them for  priests [and] for Levites, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as the new  heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And from moneth to moneth, and from Sabbath to Sabbath shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall go forth, and look upon the  carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their  worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence  to all flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
