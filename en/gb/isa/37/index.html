and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against  Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He heard also men say of Tirhakah, King of Ethiopia, Beholde, he is come out to fight against thee: and when he heard it, he sent other messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest,  deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beholde, thou hast heard what the Kings of Asshur haue done to all lands in destroying them, and shalt thou be deliuered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, [as]  Gozan, and  Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who [were] in Telassar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where is the King of Hamath, and the King of Arpad, and the King of the citie of Sepharuaim, Hena and Iuah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Hezekiah receiued the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went vp into the House of the Lorde, and Hezekiah spread it before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayed vnto the Lorde, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that  dwellest [between] the cherubim, thou [art] the God, [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Encline thine eare, O Lord, and heare: open thine eyes, O Lorde, and see, and heare all the wordes of Saneherib, who hath sent to blaspheme the liuing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and  their countries,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And haue cast their gods in ye fire: for they were no gods, but the worke of mans hands, euen wood or stone: therefore they destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that  all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou [art] the LORD, [even] thou only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent vnto Hezekiah, saying, Thus sayth the Lord God of Israel, Because thou hast prayed vnto me, concerning Saneherib king of Asshur,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This [is] the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The  virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised, [and] derided thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and lifted thy eyes on high? [even] against the  Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By thy seruants hast thou railed on the Lord, and sayd, By the multitude of my charets I am come vp to the top of the mountaines to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut downe the hie cedars thereof, and the faire firre trees thereof, and I will goe vp to the heightes of his top and to the forest of his fruitfull places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have dug,  and drank water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Hast thou not heard long ago, [how] I have done it; [and] of ancient times,  that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fortified cities [into] ruinous heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore their inhabitants [were] of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were [as] the grass of the field, and [as] the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, and [as grain] blighted  before it is grown up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I know thy abode, and thy  going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my  hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou  camest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this [shall be] a  sign to thee, Ye shall eat [this] year such as groweth of itself; and the  second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And  the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For out of Ierusalem shall goe a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeale of the Lord of hostes shall doe this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore thus sayth the Lord, concerning the King of Asshur, He shall not enter into this citie, nor shoote an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a mount against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>By the same way that he came, he shall returne, and not come into this citie, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant  David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the Angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the campe of Asshur an hundreth, fourescore, and fiue thousand: so when they arose early in the morning, beholde, they were all dead corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at  Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and  Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
