I have showed ye new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I  knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time [that] thy ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the  womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee,  that I cut thee not off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined thee, but  not with silver; I have  chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my own sake, [even] for my own sake, will I do [it]: for how should [my name]  be profaned?  and I will not give my glory to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called;  I [am] he; I [am] the first, I also [am] the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: [when] I call to them,  they stand up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath declared these [things]? The LORD hath loved  him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, euen I haue spoken it, and I haue called him: I haue brought him, and his way shal prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come ye near to me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the  beginning; from the time that it was, there [am] I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath  sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I [am] the LORD thy God who teacheth thee  to profit, who leadeth thee by the way [that] thou shouldest go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that thou haddest hearkened to my commaundements! then had thy prosperitie bene as the floude, and thy righteousnesse as the waues of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy body like its gravel; his  name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it [even] to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they  thirsted not [when] he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he broke the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[There is] no  peace, saith the LORD, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
