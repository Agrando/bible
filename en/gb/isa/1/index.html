ye will revolt more and more: the whole  head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the  sole of the foot even to the head [there is] no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed,  neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country [is] desolate, your cities [are] burned with fire: your land, foreigners devour it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, as overthrown by  foreigners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of  Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Except the LORD of hosts  had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been  as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of the LORD, ye  rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I  delight not in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When ye come to appeare before me, who required this of your hands to tread in my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; [it is] iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your  new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble to me; I am weary of bearing [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full  of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash ye, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Learn to  do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now,  and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be  white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye  are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if ye refuse and be rebellious, ye shalbe deuoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How is the  faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now  murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thy  silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thy princes [are] rebellious, and companions of  thieves: every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the  mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will  rid myself of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross,  and take away all thy tin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed with  judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the  destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they shall be ashamed of the  oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For ye shalbe as an oke, whose leafe fadeth: and as a garden that hath no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall be as a  wick, and its maker as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench [them].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
