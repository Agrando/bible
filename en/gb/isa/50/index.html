Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why, when I came, [was there] no man? when I called, [was there] none to answer? Is my hand  shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish smelleth rotten, because [there is] no water, and dieth for thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make  sackcloth their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord GOD hath given  me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to [him that is]  weary: he awakeneth morning by morning, he awakeneth my ear to hear  as the learned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord God hath opened mine eare and I was not rebellious, neither turned I backe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I gave my back to the  smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Lord God will helpe me, therefore shall I not bee confounded: therefore haue I set my face like a flint, and I knowe that I shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hee is neere that iustifieth mee: who will contend with me?
