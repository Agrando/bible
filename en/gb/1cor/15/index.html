(And when he saith that all things are subdued to him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put downe all things vnder him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when all things shall be subdued unto him,  then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that  God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Else what shall they do which are baptized  for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I protest by your  rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If  after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?  let us  eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Awake to liue righteously, and sinne not: for some haue not ye knowledge of God, I speake this to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shalbe, but bare corne as it falleth, of wheat, or of some other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beastes, and another of fishes, and another of birdes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are also heauenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but the glorie of the heauenly is one, and the glorie of the earthly is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is another glorie of the sunne, and another glorie of the moone, and another glorie of the starres: for one starre differeth from another starre in glorie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is  sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in  dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in  power:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And so it is written, The  first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a  quickening spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man [is] of the earth,  earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from  heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne the  image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now this I say, brethren, that  flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I shew you a  mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>In  a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortall must put on immortalitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So when this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortall hath put on immortalitie, then shalbe brought to passe the saying that is written, Death is swallowed vp into victorie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O death where is thy sting? O graue where is thy victorie?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death is sinne: and ye strength of sinne is the Lawe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the  Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
