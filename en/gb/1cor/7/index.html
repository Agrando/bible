But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say therefore to the  unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to  burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from [her] husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But and if shee depart, let her remaine vnmaried, or be reconciled vnto her husband, & let not the husband put away his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the woman which hath an husbande that beleeueth not, if he be content to dwell with her, let her not forsake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband is  sanctified by the  wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the  husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they  holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in  such [cases]:  but God hath called us to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt saue thine husband? Or what knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt saue thy wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath  called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not  become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and vncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandements of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let euery man abide in the same vocation wherein he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Art thou called [being] a servant?  care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use [it] rather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he that is called in the  Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Christ's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with  God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my  judgment, as  one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I suppose therefore that  this is good for the  present distress, [I say], that [it is] good for a man so to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Art thou bounde vnto a wife? Seeke not to be loosed: art thou loosed from a wife? Seeke not a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the  flesh: but I  spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brethren, the time [is]  short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they that  weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they that use this  world, as not abusing [it]: for the  fashion of this world passeth away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I would haue you without care. The vnmaried careth for the things of the Lord, howe he may please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he that is married  careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please [his] wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There is difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in  spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please [her] husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I speak for your own  profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of [her] age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he  sinneth not: let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his  heart, having no  necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth [her] not in marriage doeth  better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The wife is bound by the  law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the  Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But shee is more blessed, if she so abide, in my iudgement: and I thinke that I haue also the Spirite of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
