What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is  broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After the same maner also he tooke the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the Newe Testament in my blood: this doe as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye shewe the Lords death till hee come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord,  unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let  a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not  discerning the Lord's body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we would  judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are iudged, we are chastened of the Lord, because we should not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation.  And the rest will I set in order when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
