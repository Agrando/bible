Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But a brother goeth to law with a brother, and that vnder the infidels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore there is utterly a  fault among you, because ye go to law one with another.  Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nay, yee your selues doe wrong, and doe harme, and that to your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners shall inherite the kingdome of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the  name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the  power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God hath also raised vp the Lord, and shall raise vs vp by his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make [them] the members of an harlot? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for  two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But hee that is ioyned vnto the Lorde, is one spirite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost [which is] in you, which ye have of God, and  ye are not your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For yee are bought for a price: therefore glorifie God in your bodie, and in your spirit: for they are Gods.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
