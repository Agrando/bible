I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the  understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Else when thou shalt bless with the  spirit, how shall he that  occupieth the room of the unlearned say  Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thou verely giuest thankes well, but the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet in the church I had rather speak  five words with my understanding, that [by my voice] I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the  law it is written, With [men of] other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying [serveth] not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in [those that are]  unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophecie, and there come in one that beleeueth not, or one vnlearned, hee is rebuked of all men, and is iudged of all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And so are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so he will fall downe on his face and worship God, and say plainely that God is in you in deede.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any man speak in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course; and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there be no interpreter, let him keepe silence in the Church, which speaketh languages, and let him speake to himselfe, and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if any thing be reueiled to another that sitteth by, let the first holde his peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For ye may all prophecie one by one, that all may learne, and all may haue comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the  spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as we see in all ye Churches of the Saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be under obedience, as also saith the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they will learne any thing, let them aske their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speake in the Church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any man think himself to be a prophet, or  spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done honestly, and by order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
