things they are worthily punished & tormented by ye multitude of beasts.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 In stead of the which punishment thou hast bene fauourable to thy people, and to satisfie their appetite, hast prepared a meat of a strange tast, euen quailes,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 To the intent that they that desired meat, by the things which were shewed & sent among them, might turne away their necessary desire, and that they, which had suffred penurie for a space, shoulde also feele a newe taste.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 For it was requisite, that they which vsed tyrannie, should fall into extreeme pouertie, and that to these onely it should be shewed, howe their enemies were tormented.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 For when the cruell fiercenes of the beasts came vpon them, & they were hurt with the stinges of cruell serpents,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 Thy wrath indured not perpetually, but they were troubled for a litle season, that they might bee reformed, hauing a signe of saluation, to remember the commandement of thy Lawe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 For he that turned toward it, was not healed by the thing that he sawe, but by thee, O Sauiour of all.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 So in this thou shewedst our enemies, that it is thou, which deliuerest from all euill.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 For the biting of grashoppers and flies killed them, and there was no remedie found for their life: for they were worthy to be punished by such.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 But the teeth of the venemous dragos could not ouercome thy children: for thy mercy came to helpe them, and healed them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 For they were pricked, because they should remember thy woordes, and were speedily healed, least they should fal into so deepe forgetfulnes, that they could not be called backe by thy benefite.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 For neither herbe nor plaster healed them, but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 For thou hast the power of life and death, and leadest downe vnto the gates of hell, & bringest vp againe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 A man in deede by his wickednesse may slaie another: but when the spirite is gone foorth, it turneth not againe, neither can he cal againe the soule that is taken away.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 But it is not possible to escape thine hand.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 For the vngodly that woulde not knowe thee, were punished by the strength of thine arme, with strange raine and with haile, and were pursued with tempest, that they coulde not auoid, and were consumed with fire.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 For it was a wonderous thing that fire might doe more then water, which quencheth all things: but the world is the auenger of the righteous.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 For sometime was the fire so tame, that the beasts, which were sent against the vngodly, burnt not: and that, because they should see & know, that they were persecuted with the punishment of God.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 And sometime burnt the fire in the middes of the water aboue the power of fire, that it might destroy the generation of the vniust land.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 In the steade whereof thou hast fed thine owne people with Angels foode, and sent them bread readie from heauen without their labour, which had aboundance of al pleasures in it and was meete for all tastes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 For thy sustenance declared thy sweetenesse vnto thy children, which serued to the appetite of him, that tooke it, and was meete to that that euery man would.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>{\cf2 Moreouer the snowe and yee abode the fire and melted not, that they might know, that the fire burning in the haile, and sparkeling in the raine, destroied the fruite of the enemies.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 Againe it forgate his owne strength, that the righteous might be nourished.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>{\cf2 For the creature that serueth thee which art the maker, is fierce in punishing the vnrighteous: but it is easie to doe good vnto such as put their trust in thee.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>{\cf2 Therefore was it changed at the same time vnto all facions to serue thy grace, which nourisheth all things, according to the desire of them that had neede thereof,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>{\cf2 That thy children whome thou louest, O Lorde, might knowe, that it is not the increase of fruites that feedeth men, but that it is thy woorde, which preserueth them that trust in thee.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>{\cf2 For that which coulde not be destroied with the fire, being onely warmed a little with the sunne beames, melted,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 That it might bee knowen that we ought to preuent the sunne rising to giue thanks vnto thee, and to salute thee before the day spring.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 For the hope of the vnthankfull shall melt as the winter yce, and flowe away as vnprofitable waters.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
