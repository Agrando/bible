mortall & a man like all other, and am come of him that was first made of the earth.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 And in my mothers wombe was I fashioned to be flesh in tenne moneths: I was brought together into blood of the seed of man, and by the pleasure that commeth with sleepe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 And when I was borne, I receiued the common ayre, and fell vpon the earth, which is of like nature, crying & weeping at the first as all other do.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 I was nourished in swadling cloths, and with cares.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 For there is no King that had any other beginning of birth.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 All men then haue one entrance vnto life, and a like going out.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 Wherefore I prayed, and vnderstanding was giuen mee: I called, and the spirit of wisdome came vnto me.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 I preferred her to scepters and thrones, and counted riches nothing in comparison of her.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 Neither did I compare precious stones vnto her: for all gold is but a litle grauel in respect of her, and siluer shalbe counted but clay before her.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 I loued her aboue health and beautie, and purposed to take her for my light: for her light cannot be quenched.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 All good things therefore came to me together with her, & innumerable riches thorow her hands.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 So I was glad in all: for wisdome was the author thereof, and I knewe not that she was the mother of these things.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 And I learned vnfainedly, and communicated without enuie, and I do not hide her riches.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 For she is an infinite treasure vnto men, which who so vse, become partakers of the loue of God, and are accepted for the giftes of knowledge.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 God hath graunted me to speake according to my minde, and to iudge worthily of the thinges, that are giuen me: for he is the leader vnto wisdome, and the directer of the wise.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 For in his hand are both we and our wordes, and all wisdome, and the knowledge of the workes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 For he hath giuen me the true knowledge of the things that are, so that I knowe how the worlde was made, and the powers of the elements,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 The beginning & the end, and the mids of the times: how the times alter, & the change of ye seasons,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 The course of ye yere, the situatio of the starres,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 The nature of liuing things, and the furiousnes of beastes, the power of the windes, and the imaginations of men, the diuersities of plantes, and the vertues of rootes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 And all things both secret and knowen doe I knowe: for wisdome the worker of all things, hath taught me it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>{\cf2 For in her is the Spirit of vnderstading, which is holy, ye only begotten, manifold, subtil, moueable, cleare, vndefiled, euident, not hurtfull, louing the good, sharpe, which cannot be letted, doing good,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 Courteous, stable, sure, without care, hauing all power, circumspect in all thinges, and passing through all, intellectuall, pure and subtil spirites.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>{\cf2 For wisdom is nimbler then all nimble things: she goeth thorowe and atteineth to all thinges, because of her purenesse.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>{\cf2 For she is the breth of the power of God, & a pure influence that floweth fro the glory of the Almighty: therfore can no defiled thing come vnto her.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>{\cf2 For she is the brightnesse of the euerlasting light, the vndefiled mirrour of the maiestie of God, and the image of his goodnesse.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>{\cf2 And being one, she can do all things, and remayning in her selfe, renueth all, and according to the ages shee entreth into the holy soules, and maketh them the friendes of God and Prophets.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 For God loueth none, if he dwel not with wisdom.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 For she is more beautifull then the sunne, and is aboue all the order of the starres, and the light is not to be compared vnto her.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 For night commeth vpon it, but wickednesse cannot ouercome wisdome.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
