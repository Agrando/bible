who hath marked his word, and heard [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Beholde, the tempest of the Lorde goeth forth in his wrath, and a violent whirlewinde shal fall downe vpon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he shall have executed, and till he shall have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye  shall consider it perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I haue not sent these prophets, sayth the Lord, yet they ranne; I haue not spoken to them, and yet they prophecied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my counsel, and  had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[Am] I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God  afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can any hide him selfe in secrete places, that I shall not see him, sayth the Lorde? Do not I fill heauen and earth, saieth the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I  have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Howe long? Doe the prophets delite to prophecie lies, euen prophecying the deceit of their owne heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who think to cause  my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet that hath a dream, let him  tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully.  What [is] the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is not my word euen like a fire, sayeth the Lorde? and like an hammer, that breaketh the stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, behold, I [am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that  steal my words every one from his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I [am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say,  He saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Beholde, I will come against them that prophecie false dreames, saith the Lorde, and doe tell them, and cause my people to erre by their lies, and by their flatteries, and I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they bring no profite vnto this people, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What [is] the  burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And [as for] the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The  burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus shall yee say euery one to his neighbour, and euerie one to his brother, What hath the Lorde answered? and what hath the Lorde spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's  word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus shalt thou say to the Prophet, What hath the Lord answered thee? and what hath the Lorde spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if you say, The burden of the Lorde, Then thus saith the Lorde, Because yee say this word, The burden of the Lorde, and I haue sent vnto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the Lorde,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore beholde, I, euen I will vtterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the citie that I gaue you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And will bring an euerlasting reproche vpon you, and a perpetual shame which shall neuer be forgotten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
