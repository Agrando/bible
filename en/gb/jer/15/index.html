Then tell them, Thus saith the Lord, Such as are appointed to death, vnto death: and such as are for the sworde, to the sworde: and such as are for the famine, to the famine: and such as are for the captiuitie, to the captiuitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the  dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will  cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth,  because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for [that] which he did in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who shal then haue pitie vpon thee, O Ierusalem? Or who shalbe sorie for thee? Or who shal go to pray for thy peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am  weary with repenting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will fan them with a fan  in the gates of the land; I will bereave [them] of children, I will destroy my people, [since] they return not from their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their widows  are multiplied to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused [him] to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She that hath borne  seven languisheth: she hath breathed her last; her sun is  gone down while [it was] yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the remnant of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither  lent on interest, nor have men lent to me on interest; [yet] every one of them doth curse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The LORD said,  Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee [well] in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Shall  iron break the northern iron and the steel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thy substance and thy treasures wil I giue to be spoyled without gaine, and that for all thy sinnes euen in all thy borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I wil make thee to go with thine enemies into a land that thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shal burne you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my  persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thy words were found, and I  ate them; and thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone  because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, [which] refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether to me  as a liar, [and as] waters [that] fail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou shalt  return, then will I bring thee again, [and] thou shalt stand before me: and if thou shalt separate the  precious from the vile, thou shalt be  as my mouth: let them return  to thee; but return not thou to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will make thee to this people a fortified brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not  prevail against thee: for I [am] with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will deliuer thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeeme thee out of the hand of the tyrants.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
