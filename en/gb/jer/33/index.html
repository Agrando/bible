For I will cause to return the captives of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus sayth the Lorde of hostes, Againe in this place, which is desolate, without man, & without beast, and in all the cities thereof there shall be dwelling for shepheards to rest their flockes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the  mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counteth [them], saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Beholde, the dayes come, sayth the Lorde, that I wil performe that good thing, which I haue promised vnto the house of Israel, & to the house of Iudah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, will I cause  the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety: and this [is the name] by which  she shall be called, The LORD our  righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus sayth the Lord, Dauid shall neuer want a man to sit vpon the throne of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Neither shall the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer  burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the worde of the Lorde came vnto Ieremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the  day, and my covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then may my couenant be broken with Dauid my seruant, that he should not haue a sonne to reigne vpon his throne, and with the Leuites, and Priests my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the army of heauen can not be nombred, neither the sand of the sea measured: so wil I multiplie the seede of Dauid my seruant, and the Leuites, that minister vnto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came to Ieremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Considerest thou not what  this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus sayth the Lorde, If my couenant be not with day and night, and if I haue not appointed the order of heauen and earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then will I cast away the seede of Iaakob and Dauid my seruant, and not take of his seede to be rulers ouer the seede of Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob: for I wil cause their captiuitie to returne, and haue compassion on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
