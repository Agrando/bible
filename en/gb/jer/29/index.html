Behold, I will send upon them the  sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile  figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be  a curse, and an horror, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent to them by my servants the prophets,  rising early and sending [them]; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Heare ye therefore the word of the Lord all ye of the captiuitie, whome I haue sent from Ierusalem to Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus saith the Lorde of hostes, the God of Israel, of Ahab the sonne of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the sonne of Maaseiah, which prophecie lyes vnto you in my Name, Beholde, I will deliuer them into the hande of Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel, and he shall slay them before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And concerning them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who [are] in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted  in the fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because they have committed  villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbour's wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and [am] a witness, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou shalt also speake to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus speaketh the Lorde of hostes, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy Name vnto all the people, that are at Ierusalem, and to Zephaniah the sonne of Maaseiah the Priest, and to all the Priests, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of  Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man [that is] mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nowe therefore why hast not thou reproued Ieremiah of Anathoth, which prophecieth vnto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For, for this cause hee sent vnto vs in Babel, saying, This captiuitie is long: buyld houses to dwell in, and plant gardens, and eate the fruites of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Zephaniah the Priest red this letter in the eares of Ieremiah the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto Ieremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Send to all them of the captiuitie, saying, Thus saith the Lorde of Shemaiah the Nehelamite, Because that Shemaiah hath prophecied vnto you, and I sent him not, and hee caused you to trust in a lye,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man  to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
