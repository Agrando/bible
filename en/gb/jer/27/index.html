Make for thee  bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And send them to the King of Edom, and to the King of Moab, & to the King of the Ammonites, and to the King of Tyrus, & to the king of Zidon, by the hande of the messengers which come to Ierusale vnto Zedekiah ye king of Iudah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And commande them to saye vnto their masters, Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say vnto your masters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I haue made the earth, the ma, and the beast that are vpon the groud, by my great power, and by my outstreched arme, and haue giuen it vnto whom it pleased me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my  servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all nations shall serve him, and his  son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land shall come: and then many nations and great kings shall  bring him into subjection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the nation and kingdome which will not serue the same Nebuchad-nezzar king of Babel, and that will not put their necke vnder the yoke of the King of Babel, the same nation will I visite, saith the Lord, with the sworde, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, vntill I haue wholy giuen them into his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore heare not your prophets nor your southsayers, nor your dreamers, nor your inchanters, nor your sorcerers, which say vnto you thus, Ye shall not serue the King of Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they prophecie a lie vnto you to cause you to goe farre from your lande, and that I should cast you out, and you should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the nation that put their neckes vnder the yoke of the King of Babel, & serue him, those wil I let remaine stil in their owne land, saith the Lord, and they shall occupie it, and dwel therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I spake also to Zedekiah king of Iudah according to all these wordes, saying, Put your neckes vnder the yoke of the King of Babel, and serue him and his people, that ye may liue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why will ye dye, thou, and thy people by the sworde, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lorde hath spoken against the nation, that will not serue the King of Babel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore heare not the words of the prophets, that speake vnto you, saying, Ye shall not serue the King of Babel: for they prophecie a lie vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I haue not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they prophecie a lie in my name, that I might cast you out, and that ye might perish, both you, and the prophets that prophecie vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be  brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Heare them not, but serue the King of Babel, that ye may liue: wherefore shoulde this citie be desolate?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now  make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and [in] the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thus saith the Lord of hostes, concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remaine in this citie,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Which Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel tooke not, when he caryed away captiue Ieconiah the sonne of Iehoiakim King of Iudah from Ierusalem to Babel, with all the nobles of Iudah and Ierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remaine in the House of the Lorde, and in the house of the King of Iudah, and at Ierusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit  them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
