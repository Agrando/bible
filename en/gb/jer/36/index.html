So Baruch the sonne of Neriah, tooke the roule in his hand, and came vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they saide vnto him, Sit downe now, and reade it, that we may heare. So Baruch read it in their audience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were  afraid both one and another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they examined Baruch, saying, Tell vs nowe, howe diddest thou write all these wordes at his mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these wordes vnto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ynke in the booke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said the princes to Baruch, Go,  hide thyself, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went in to the King to the court, but they layde vp the roule in the chamber of Elishama the Chancellour and tolde the King all the wordes, that he might heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the King sent Iehudi to fet the roule, and he tooke it out of Elishama the Chancellours chamber, and Iehudi read it in the audience of the King, and in the audience of all the princes, which stoode beside the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the  ninth month: and [there was a fire] on the hearth burning before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Iehudi had read three, or foure sides, hee cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire, that was on the hearth vntil all the roule was consumed in the fire, that was on the hearth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yet they were not afraid, nor tore  their garments, [neither] the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neuerthelesse, Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah had besought the King, that he would not burne ye roule: but he would not heare them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD  hid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah (after that the King had burnt the roule and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Ieremiah) saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take thee again  another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah hath burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this scroll, saying,  Why hast thou written in it, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and beast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have  none to sit upon the throne of David: and his  dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will visite him and his seede, and his seruants for their iniquitie, and I will bring vpon them, and vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and vpo the men of Iudah all the euil that I haue pronounced against them: but they would not heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then tooke Ieremiah another roule, and gaue it Baruch the scribe the sonne of Neriah, which wrote therein at the mouth of Ieremiah all the wordes of the booke which Iehoiakim King of Iudah had burnt in the fire, and there were added besides them many like wordes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
