and if I giue thee counsell, thou wilt not heare me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the King sware secretly vnto Ieremiah, saying, As the Lorde liueth that made vs these soules, I will not slay thee, nor giue thee into the hands of those men that seeke thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon's  princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if thou wilt not go forth to the King of Babels princes, then shall this citie be giuen into the hand of ye Caldeans, & they shal burne it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they  mock me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Ieremiah sayd, They shall not deliuer thee: hearken vnto the voyce of the Lorde, I beseech thee, which I speake vnto thee: so shal it be well vnto thee, and thy soule shall liue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if thou wilt refuse to go forth, this is the worde that the Lorde hath shewed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, behold, all the women that are  left in the king of Judah's house [shall be] brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those [women] shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, [and] they are turned away back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they shall bring out all thy wiues, & thy children to the Caldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hands, but shalt be taken by the hand of the King of Babel: and this citie shalt thou cause to be burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Zedekiah vnto Ieremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if ye princes vnderstand that I haue talked with thee, & they come vnto thee, & say vnto thee, Declare vnto vs nowe, what thou hast sayde vnto the King, hide it not from vs, & we will not slay thee: also what the King sayd vnto thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then thou shalt say to them, I  presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then came all the princes vnto Ieremiah and asked him; he tolde them according to all these wordes that the King had commaunded: so they left off speaking with him, for the matter was not perceiued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Ieremiah abode still in the court of the prison, vntill the day that Ierusalem was taken: and he was there, when Ierusalem was taken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
