Then answered  I, and said, So be it, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the Lord saide vnto me, Cry all these words in the cities of Iudah, and in the streetes of Ierusalem, saying, Heare yee the words of this couenant, and doe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day [that] I brought them out of the land of Egypt, [even] to this day,  rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their  evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the  words of this covenant, which I commanded [them] to do; but they did [them] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said to me, A  conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They are turned backe to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to heare my wordes: and they went after other gods to serue them: thus the house of Israel, & the house of Iudah haue broken my couenant, which I made with their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to me,  I will not hearken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall the cities of Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem goe, and crie vnto the gods vnto whome they offer incense, but they shall not bee able to helpe them in time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For [according to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and [according to] the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to [that] shameful thing, [even] altars to burn incense to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore  pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear [them] in the time when they cry to me for their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What hath my  beloved to do in my house, [seeing] she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh  is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, [and] of goodly fruit: with the  noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Lorde of hostes that planted thee, hath pronounced a plague against thee, for the wickednes of the house of Israel, and of the house of Iudah, which they haue done against themselues to prouoke me to anger in offering incense vnto Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD hath given me knowledge [of it], and I know [it]: then thou didst show me  their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I [was] like a lamb [or] an ox [that] is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised plots against me, [saying], Let us  destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy  vengeance on them: for to thee have I revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the men of  Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying,  Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus therefore sayth the Lorde of hostes, Beholde, I will visite them: the yong men shall die by the sword: their sonnes and their daughters shall die by famine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And none of them shall remaine: for I will bring a plague vpon the men of Anathoth, euen the yeere of their visitation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
