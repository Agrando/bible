And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entrance of the  new gate of the LORD'S [house].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then spake the Priestes, and the prophets vnto the princes, and to all the people, saying, This man is worthie to die: for he hath prophecied against this citie, as ye haue heard with your eares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD  sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore nowe amende your wayes and your workes, and heare the voyce of the Lorde your God, that the Lorde may repent him of the plague, that he hath pronounced against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for me, beholde, I am in your hands: do with me as ye thinke good and right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But knowe ye for certaine, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood vpon your selues, and vpon this citie, and vpon the inhabitants thereof: for of a trueth the Lord hath sent me vnto you, to speake all these words in your eares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then saide the princes and all the people vnto the Priestes, and to the prophets, This man is not worthie to die: for he hath spoken vnto vs in the Name of the Lorde our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then rose vp certaine of the Elders of the lande, and spake to all the assemblie of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the  house as the high places of the forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the  evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was also a man that prophecied in the Name of the Lord, one Vriiah the sonne of Shemaiah, of Kiriath-iarem, who prophecied against this citie, and against this lande, according to all the wordes of Ieremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nowe when Iehoiakim the King with all his men of power, and all the princes heard his wordes, the King sought to slay him.
