yet thou, O LORD, [art] in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus saith the Lord vnto this people, Thus haue they delited to wander: they haue not refrained their feete, therefore the Lorde hath no delight in them: but he will now remember their iniquitie, and visite their sinnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said the LORD to me,  Pray not for this people for [their] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they fast, I will not heare their cry, and when they offer burnt offering, and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sworde, and by the famine and by the pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the  prophets say to them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Lord said vnto me, The prophets prophecie lyes in my Name: I haue not sent them, neither did I command them, neither spake I vnto them, but they prophecie vnto you a false vision, and diuination, and vanitie, and deceitfulnes of their owne heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord, Concerning the prophets that prophecie in my Name, whom I haue not sent, yet they say, Sworde and famine shal not be in this land, by sword and famine shal those prophets be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people to whome these prophets doe prophecie, shalbe cast out in the streetes of Ierusalem, because of the famine, & the sword, & there shall be none to bury them, both they, and their wiues, and their sonnes, and their daughters: for I wil powre their wickednes vpon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore thou shalt say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with  tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about  into a land that they know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast thou utterly rejected  Judah? hath thy soul abhorred Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and [there is] no healing for us? we looked for peace, and [there is] no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We  acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, [and] the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Doe not abhorre vs: for thy Names sake cast not downe the throne of thy glory: remember and breake not thy couenant with vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there [any] among the  vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers?
