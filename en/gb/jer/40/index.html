So the chiefe stewarde gaue him vitailes and a rewarde, and let him goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to  Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when all the captains of the forces  who [were] in the fields, [even] they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even  Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam, the sonne of Shaphan sware vnto them, and to their men, saying, Feare not to serue the Caldeans: dwell in the lande, and serue the King of Babel, and it shall be well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for me, Beholde, I will dwell at Mizpah to serue the Caldeans, which will come vnto vs: but you, gather you wine, and sommer fruites, and oyle, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities, that ye haue taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Likewise when all the Jews that [were] in  Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that [were] in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Euen all the Iewes returned out of all places where they were driuen, and came to the land of Iudah to Gedaliah vnto Mizpah, and gathered wine and sommer fruites, very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moreouer Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the hoste, that were in the fieldes, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And said to him, Dost thou certainly know that  Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Iohanan the sonne of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me goe, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it. Wherefore should he kill thee, that all the Iewes, which are gathered vnto thee, shoulde be scattered, and the remnant in Iudah perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt  not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
