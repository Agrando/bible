Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise against me, a destroying  wind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And wil send vnto Babel fanners that shal fanne her, & shal empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shalbe against her on euery side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Also to the bender that bendeth his bowe, and to him that lifteth himselfe vp in his brigandine, will I say, Spare not her yong men, but destroy all her hoste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus the slaine shal fall in the lande of the Caldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streetes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Israel [hath] not [been]  forsaken, nor Judah by his God, by the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee from the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this [is] the time of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render to her a recompence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Babylon [hath been] a golden cup in the  LORD'S hand, that made all the earth drunk: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are  mad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Babel is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howle for her, bring balme for her sore, if she may be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let  us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth to heaven, and is lifted [even] to the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The LORD hath brought forth our  righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his purpose [is] against Babylon, to destroy it; because it [is] the vengeance of the LORD, the  vengeance of his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Set vp the standart vpon the walles of Babel, make the watch strong: set vp the watchmen: prepare the skoutes: for the Lord hath both deuised, and done that which he spake against the inhabitantes of Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O thou that dwellest upon many  waters, abundant in treasures, thy end is come, [and] the measure of thy covetousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Lord of hostes hath sworne by him selfe, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers, and they shall cry and shoute against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He hath made the earth by his power, & established the world by his wisedome, and hath stretched out the heauen by his discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hee giueth by his voyce the multitude of waters in the heauen, and he causeth the cloudes to ascend from the endes of the earth: he turneth lightnings to raine, and bringeth forth the winde out of his treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every man is senseless by [his]  knowledge; every goldsmith is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image [is] falsehood, and [there is] no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They [are] vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their  judgment they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The  portion of Jacob [is] not like them; for he [is] the one who formed of all things: and [Israel is] the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts [is] his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou [art] my  battle axe [and] weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And by thee wil I breake horse and horseman, and by thee will I breake the charet & him that rideth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By thee also will I breake man & woman, and by thee wil I breake olde & yong, & by thee wil I breake the yong man and the mayde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I wil also breake by thee the shepheard & his flocke, and by thee will I breake the husband man & his yoke of oxen, & by thee will I breake the dukes and princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will render vnto Babel, and to all the inhabitants of the Caldeans all their euil, that they haue done in Zion, euen in your sight, sayth the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, I [am] against thee, O destroying  mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the  rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations, but thou shalt be destroyed for euer, sayth the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of  Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Prepare against her the nations with the Kings of the Medes, the dukes thereof, and the princes thereof, & all the land of his dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the land shall tremble and sorow: for the deuise of the Lorde shalbe performed against Babel, to make the lande of Babel waste without an inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The strong men of Babel haue ceased to fight: they haue remayned in their holdes: their strength hath fayled, and they were like women: they haue burnt her dwelling places, and her barres are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at  [one] end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And that the passages are stopped, and the reedes burnt with fire, & the me of war troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon [is] like a threshingfloor, [it is] time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest  shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath  devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, he hath cast me out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The spoyle of me, and that which was left of me, is brought vnto Babel, shall the inhabitant of Zion say: and my blood vnto the inhabitantes of Caldea, shal Ierusalem say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy  cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Babel shall be as heapes, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, & an hissing, without an inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They shal rore together like lions, and yell as the lyons whelpes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>In their  heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I wil bring them downe like lambes to the slaughter, and like rams and goates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>How is  Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an horror among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The  sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of its waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Her cities are desolate: the land is dry and a wildernes, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth the sonne of man passe thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which  he hath swallowed: and the nations shall not flow together any more to him: even the wall of Babylon shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>My people, go out of the middes of her, & deliuer yee euery man his soule from the fierce wrath of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And lest your heart should faint, and ye should fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come [one]  year, and after that in [another] year [shall come] a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore beholde, the dayes come, that I will visite the images of Babel, & the whole land shalbe confounded, and all her slayne shal fall in the middes of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the heaven and  the earth, and all that [is] in them, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come to her from the north, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>As Babylon [hath caused] the  slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Ye that  have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>We are  confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for foreigners are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Wherefore behold, the dayes come, sayth the Lord, that I will visite her grauen images, and through all her land the wounded shal grone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Though Babylon should mount up to  heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, [yet] from me shall spoilers come to her, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>A sound of a cry commeth from Babel, and great destruction from the land of the Caldeans,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Because the Lorde hath layde Babel waste and destroyed from her the great voyce, and her waues shall roare like great waters, and a sounde was made by their noyse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Because the destroyer is come vpon her, euen vpon Babel, and her strong men are taken, their bowes are broken: for the Lorde God that recompenceth, shal surely recompence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And I will  make drunk her princes, and her wise [men], her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The  broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the people in the fire, and they shall be weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the  fourth year of his reign. And [this] Seraiah [was] a quiet prince.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So Ieremiah wrote in a booke all the euill that should come vpo Babel: euen al these things, that are written against Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Ieremiah sayd to Sheraiah, Whe thou commest vnto Babel, and shalt see, & shalt reade all these wordes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then shalt thou say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to destroy it, that none should remaine in it, neither man nor beast, but that it should be desolate for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall be, when thou hast finished reading this book, [that] thou shalt bind a  stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall  be weary. Thus far [are] the words of Jeremiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
