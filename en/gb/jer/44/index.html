and they are wasted [and] desolate, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, Wherfore commit ye this great euill against your soules, to cut off from you man and woman, childe and suckling out of Iudah, and leaue you none to remaine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In that yee prouoke mee vnto wrath with the woorkes of your hands, burning incense vnto other Gods in the lande of Egypt whither yee be gone to dwell: that yee might bring destruction vnto your selues, and that ye might be a curse and a reproch among all nations of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the  kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They are not humbled vnto this day, neither haue they feared nor walked in my lawe nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde of hostes the God of Israel, Beholde, I will set my face against you to euill and to destroy all Iudah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will take the remnant of Judah, that  have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, [and] fall in the land of Egypt; they shall [even] be consumed by the sword [and] by the famine: they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, [and] an horror, and a  curse, and a reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I will visite them that dwel in the land of Egypt, as I haue visited Ierusalem, by ye sworde, by the famine, and by the pestilence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but  such as shall escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then all the men which knewe that their wiues had burnt incense vnto other gods and all the wome that stoode by, a great multitude, euen all the people that dwelt in the lande of Egypt in Pathros, answered Ieremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[As for] the word that thou hast spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will  not hearken to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we will certainly do whatever thing proceedeth from our own mouth, to burn incense to  the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for [then] we had  plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But since wee left off to burne incense to the Queene of heauen, and to powre out drinke offerings vnto her, we haue had scarcenesse of all things, and haue beene consumed by the sworde and by the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without  our husbands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said Ieremiah vnto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had giuen him that answere, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Did not the Lorde remember the incense, that yee burnt in the cities of Iudah, and in the streetes of Ierusalem, both you, and your fathers, your Kinges, and your princes, and the people of the land, and hath he not considered it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that the Lord could no longer forbeare, because of the wickednes of your inuentions, and because of the abominations, which ye haue committed: therefore is your lande desolate and an astonishment, and a curse and without inhabitant, as appeareth this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because ye haue burnt incense and because ye haue sinned against the Lorde, and haue not obeyed the voyce of the Lorde, nor walked in his Lawe, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies, therefore this plague is come vpon you, as appeareth this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Moreouer Ieremiah saide vnto all the people and to all the women, Heare the word of the Lord, all Iudah that are in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your  hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name  shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I wil watch ouer them for euil and not for good, and all men of Iudah that are in the land of Egypt, shalbe consumed by the sword, and by the famine, vntill they be vtterly destroied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet a small number that escape the sword  shall return from the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this shal be a signe vnto you, saith the Lord, whe I visit you in this place, that ye may know that my words shal surely stand against you for euill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will  give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
