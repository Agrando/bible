Woe to us! for the day departeth, for the shadows of the evening are lengthened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Arise, and let vs goe vp by night, and destroy her palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath the Lord of hostes said, Hewe downe wood, and cast a mounte against Ierusalem: this citie must be visited: all oppression is in the middes of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness:  violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually [are] grief and wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be thou instructed, O  Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn  back thy hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear [is]  uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in:  I will pour it out upon the  children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with [him that is] full of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their houses with their landes, & wiues also shalbe turned vnto strangers: for I will stretch out mine hande vpon the inhabitants of the land, sayeth the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For from the least of them, euen vnto the greatest of them, euery one is giuen vnto couetousnesse, and from the Prophet euen vnto the Priest, they all deale falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have healed also the hurt [of the daughter] of my people slightly, saying,  Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not ashamed, no neither coulde they haue any shame: therefore they shall fall among the slaine: when I shall visite them, they shall be cast downe, sayth the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the  old paths, where [is] the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk [in it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also I set  watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, ye  nations, and know, O congregation, what [is] among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Heare, O earth, beholde, I will cause a plague to come vpon this people, euen the fruite of their owne imaginations: because they haue not taken heede vnto my woordes, nor to my Lawe, but cast it off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To what purpose cometh there to me  incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a distant country? your burnt offerings [are] not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde, Beholde, I will laie stumbling blockes before this people, and the fathers and the sonnes together shall fall vpon them: the neighbour and his friende shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the  north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>With bowe and shield shal they be weaponed: they are cruell and will haue no compassion: their voyce roareth like the sea, and they ride vpon horses, well appointed, like men of warre against thee, O daughter Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard the report of it: our hands become  feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pain, as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Goe not foorth into the fielde, nor walke by the way: for the sword of the enemie and feare is on euery side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>O daughter of my people, girde thee with sackecloth, and wallowe thy selfe in the ashes: make lamentation, and bitter mourning as for thine onely sonne: for the destroier shall suddenly come vpon vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have set  thee [for] a tower [and] a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They are all rebellious traitours, walking craftily: they are brasse, and yron, they all are destroyers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The  bellows is burned, the lead is consumed by the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They shall call them reprobate siluer, because the Lord hath reiected them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
