proclaim, [and] conceal not: say,  Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded,  Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For out of the north  there cometh a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell in it: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall  come, they and the children of Judah together, going and  weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They shal aske the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let vs cleaue to the Lorde in a perpetuall couenant that shall not be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people have been lost sheep: their  shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away [on] the mountains: they have gone from  mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD,  the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth from the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats  before the flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For loe, I will raise, and cause to come vp against Babel a multitude of mightie natios from the North countrey, and they shall set themselues in aray against her, whereby shee shall be taken: their arrowes shall be as of a strong man, which is expert, for none shall returne in vaine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that spoil her  shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of my heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass,  and bellow as bulls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore your mother shall bee sore confounded, and she that bare you, shall be ashamed: beholde, the vttermost of the nations shalbe a desert, a drie land, and a wildernes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished,  and hiss at all her plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath  sinned against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Crie against her round about: she hath giuen her hand: her foundations are fallen, and her walles are destroyed: for it is the vengeance of the Lord: take vengeance vpon her: as she hath done, doe vnto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cut off the  sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Israel [is] a scattered sheep; the lions have driven [him] away: first the king of  Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath broken his  bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, Behold, I wil visit ye King of Babel, and his land, as I haue visited the King of Asshur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will bring Israel againe to his habitation: hee shall feede on Carmel and Bashan, and his soule shall be satisfied vpon the mount Ephraim and Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In those daies, and at that time, sayeth the Lorde, the iniquitie of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none: and the sinnes of Iudah, and they shall not be founde: for I will be mercifull vnto them, whome I reserue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go up against the land of  Merathaim, [even] against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A crie of battell is in the land, and of great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How is the  hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I haue snared thee, and thou art taken, O Babel, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striuen against the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Lord hath opened his treasure, & hath brought foorth the weapons of his wrath: for this is the woorke of the Lorde God of hostes in the lande of the Caldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Come against her from the vtmost border: open her store houses: treade on her as on sheaues, and destroy her vtterly: let nothing of her be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Slay all her  bulls;

the LORD of hosts [is] his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land,  and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A sworde is vpon the Caldeans, sayeth the Lord, and vpon the inhabitants of Babel, and vpon her princes, and vpon her wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A sworde is vpon the soothsaiers, and they shall dote: a sword is vpon her strong men, & they shalbe afraide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A sworde is vpon their horses & vpon their charets, and vpon all the multitude that are in the middes of her, and they shall be like women: a sworde is vpon her treasures, and they shall be spoyled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A  drought [is] upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it [is] the land of graven images, and they are mad over [their] idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore the  wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the isles shall dwell [there], and the owls shall dwell in it: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As God destroied Sodom and Gomorah with the places thereof neere about, sayeth the Lord: so shal no man dwell theere, neither shal the sonne of man remaine therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from  the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They shall holde the bowe and the buckeler: they are cruell and vnmercifull: their voyce shall roare like the sea, and they shall ride vpon horses, and be put in aray like men to the battell against thee, O daughter of Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands  became feeble: anguish took hold of him, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who [is] a chosen [man, that] I may appoint over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that  shepherd that will stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore heare the counsell of the Lorde that hee hath deuised against Babel, and his purpose that hee hath conceiued against the lande of the Caldeans: surely the least of the flocke shall drawe them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>At the noyse of the winning of Babel the earth is moued, and the crye is heard among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
