Then I knew that this [was] the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that [was] in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, [even] seventeen  shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I writ it in the booke and signed it, and tooke witnesses, and weighed him the siluer in the balances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I took the deed of the purchase, [both] that which was sealed  [according] to the law and custom, and that which was open:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I gaue the booke of the possession vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, the sonne of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine vncles sonne, and in the presence of the witnesses, written in the booke of the possession, before al the Iewes that sate in the court of the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this deed which is open; and put them in an earthen  vessel, that they may continue many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the Lorde of hostes, the God of Israel saith thus, Houses and fieldes, and vineyardes shall be possessed againe in this land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now when I had deliuered the booke of the possession vnto Baruch, the sonne of Neriah, I prayed vnto the Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ah Lord God, beholde, thou hast made the heauen and the earth by thy great power, and by thy stretched out arme, & there is nothing hard vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shewest lovingkindness to thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their  children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, JEHOVAH of hosts, [is] his name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Great in counsell, & mightie in worke, (for thine eyes are open vpon all the wayes of ye sonnes of men, to giue to euery one according to his wayes, and according to the fruite of his workes)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, [even] to this day, and in Israel, and among [other] men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And hast brought thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signes, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, with a stretched out arme, and with great terrour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And hast giuen them this land, which thou diddest sweare to their fathers to giue them, euen a land, that floweth with milke and hony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voyce, neither walked in thy Law: all that thou commaundedst them to doe, they haue not done: therefore thou hast caused this whole plague to come vpon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold the  mounts, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thou hast sayd vnto me, O Lord God, Bye vnto thee the fielde for siluer, and take witnesses: for the citie shall be giuen into the hand of the Caldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came the worde of the Lord vnto Ieremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all  flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord, Beholde, I wil giue this citie into the hand of the Caldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchad-nezzar, King of Babel, and he shall take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Caldeans shall come and fight against this citie, and set fire on this citie and burne it, with the houses, vpon whose rouses they haue offred incense vnto Baal, and powred drinke offrings vnto other gods, to prouoke me vnto anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done evil only before me from their  youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore this citie hath bene vnto me as a prouocation of mine anger, and of my wrath, from the day, that they built it, euen vnto this day, that I should remoue it out of my sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Because of all the euill of the children of Israel, and of the children of Iudah, which they haue done to prouoke mee to anger, euen they, their Kings, their Princes, their Priests, and their Prophets, and the men of Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: though I taught them,  rising early and teaching [them], yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they set their abominations in ye house (whereupon my Name was called) to defile it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they built the high  places of Baal, which [are] in the valley of the  son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to  pass through [the fire] to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And now  therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Beholde, I will gather them out of all countreys, wherein I haue scattered them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation, and I wil bring them againe vnto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will give them  one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will make an everlasting  covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea, I wil delite in them to do them good, and I wil plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart, and with all my soule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For thus sayth the Lorde, Like as I haue brought all this great plague vpon this people, so wil I bring vpon them all the good that I haue promised them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the fields shalbe possessed in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without ma or beast, and shalbe giuen into the hand of the Caldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Men shall buy  fields for money, and signed deeds, and seal [them], and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captives to return, saith the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
