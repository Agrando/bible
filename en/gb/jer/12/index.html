[why] are they all happy that deal very treacherously?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou [art] near in their mouth, and far from their  reins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and  prepare them for the day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell in it? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said,  He shall not see our last end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If thou hast run with the  footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and [if] in the land of peace, [in which] thou didst trust, [they wearied thee], then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For euen thy brethren, and the house of thy father, euen they haue delt vnfaithfully with thee, and they haue cryed out altogether vpon thee: but beleeue them not, though they speake faire to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have forsaken  my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My heritage is to me as a  lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My heritage [is] to me [as] a  speckled bird, the birds around [are] against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Many shepherds have destroyed my  vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have made it desolate, [and being] desolate it mourneth to me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth  [it] to heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The destroyers are come vpon all the high places in the wildernesse: for the sworde of the Lord shal deuoure from the one end of the land, euen to the other ende of the lande: no flesh shall haue peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they  have put themselves to pain, [but] shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of  your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus saith the LORD against all my evil  neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them out I  will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the  ways of my people, to swear by my name, The  LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built  in the midst of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if they will not obey, then will I vtterly plucke vp, and destroy that nation, sayeth the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
