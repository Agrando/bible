Then said Ieremiah vnto him, The Lord hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will make thee to be a terrour to thy self, & to al thy friends, and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall beholde it, and I will giue all Iudah into the hande of the King of Babel, and he shall cary them captiue into Babel, and shall slay them with the sworde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreouer, I will deliuer all the substance of this citie, and all the labours thereof, and al the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the Kings of Iudah will I giue into the hande of their enemies, which shall spoyle them, and take them away and cary them to Babel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy  friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was  deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast  prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and  spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speake any more in his Name. But his worde was in mine heart as a burning fire shut vp in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side.  Report, [say they], and we will report it. All my friends watched for my fall, [saying], Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the LORD [is] with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: [their] everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, O Lorde of hostes, that tryest the righteous, and seest the reines and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for vnto thee haue I opened my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing vnto the Lorde, praise ye the Lorde: for he hath deliuered the soule of the poore fro the hande of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed [be] the day in which I was born: let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed be the man, that shewed my father, saying, A man child is borne vnto thee, and comforted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let that man be as the  cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because he slew me not at my birth; or that my mother might have been my grave, and she had not been  delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>How is it, that I came forth of the wombe, to see labour and sorowe, that my dayes shoulde be consumed with shame?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
