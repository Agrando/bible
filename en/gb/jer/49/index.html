hath he no heir? why [then] doth their king  inherit Gad, and his people dwell in  his cities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in  Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir to them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Howle, O Heshbon, for Ai is wasted: crie ye daughters of Rabbah: girde you with sackecloth: mourne and runne to and fro by the hedges: for their King shall goe into captiuitie; and his Priestes, and his princes likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why gloriest thou in the  valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I will bring  a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that are about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And  afterward I will bring again the captives of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; [Is] wisdom no more in  Teman? hath counsel perished from the prudent? hath their wisdom vanished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee ye,  turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time [that] I will punish him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If  grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave [some] gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I haue discouered Esau: I haue vncouered his secrets, and he shall not be able to hide himselfe: his seede is wasted, and his brethren and his neighbours, and there shall be none to say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leave thy  fatherless children, I will preserve [them] alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus saith the LORD;  Behold, they whose judgment [was] not to drink of the cup have assuredly drank; and [art] thou he [that] shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that  Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent to the nations, [saying], Gather ye together, and come against  her, and rise up to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For loe, I will make thee but small among the heathen, and despised among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thy feare, and ye pride of thine heart hath deceiued thee, thou that dwellest in the cleftes of the rocke, and keepest the height of ye hil: though thou shouldest make thy nest as hie as the egle, I wil bring thee downe from thece, sayth the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also Edom shall be desolate: euery one that goeth by it, shall be astonished, and shal hisse at all the plagues thereof,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As in the ouerthrowe of Sodom, and of Gomorah, and the places thereof neere about, saieth the Lord: no man shall dwell there, neither shall the sonnes of men remaine in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold,  he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make  him run away from her: and who [is] a chosen [man, that] I may appoint over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that  shepherd that will stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least  of the flock shall draw them out: surely  he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The earth is mooued at the noyse of their fall: the crie of their voice is heard in the red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle,  and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Concerning  Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; [there is] sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Damascus hath become feeble, [and] turneth herself to flee,  and fear hath seized on [her]: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How is the  city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore her yong men shall fall in her streetes, and all her men of warre shall be cut off in that day, sayeth the Lord of hostes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of  Benhadad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Concerning  Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the men of the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their  curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Fear [is] on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Flee, go far off,  dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Arise, go up to the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, [which] dwell alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And their camels shall be a bootie, and the multitude of their cattel a spoile, and I will scatter them into all windes, and to the vtmost corners, and I will bring their destruction from al the sides thereof, sayeth the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hazor shal be a dwelling for dragons, and desolation for euer: there shall no man dwell there, nor the sonnes of men remaine in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against  Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the  bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And vpon Elam I will bring the foure windes from the foure quarters of heauen, and will scatter them towardes all these windes, and there shall bee no nation, whither the fugitiues of Elam shall not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I will cause Elam to be afraied before their enemies, and before them that seeke their liues, and will bring vpon them a plague, euen the indignation of my wrath, saieth the Lord, & I wil sende the sworde after them till I haue consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will set my  throne in Elam, and will destroy from there the king and the princes, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it shall come to pass  in the latter days, [that] I will bring again the captives of Elam, saith the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
