wherefore doe I beholde euery man with his hands on his loynes as a woman in trauaile, and all faces are turned into a palenesse?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Alas! for that  day [is] great, so that none [is] like it: it [is] even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, [that] I will break  his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more  bring him into subjection:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they shall serve the LORD their God, and  David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore feare not, O my seruant Iaakob, saith the Lorde, neither be afrayde, O Israel: for loe, I will deliuer thee from a farre countrey, and thy seede from the lande of their captiuitie, and Iaakob shall turne againe, and shalbe in rest and prosperitie and none shall make him afraide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not  leave thee altogether unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus saith the Lorde, Thy bruising is incurable, and thy wound is dolorous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is none to iudge thy cause, or to lay a plaister: there are no medicines, nor help for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All thy louers haue forgotten thee: they seeke thee not: for I haue striken thee with the wound of an enemie, and with a sharpe chastisement for ye multitude of thine iniquities, because thy sinnes were increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why cryest thou for thine affliction? thy sorowe is incurable, for the multitude of thine iniquities: because thy sinnes were increased, I haue done these things vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all they that deuoure thee, shal be deuoured, & all thine enemies euery one shall goe into captiuitie: and they that spoyle thee, shalbe spoyled, and all they that robbe thee, wil I giue to be robbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health vnto thee, and I will heale thee of thy woundes, saith the Lord, because they called thee, The cast away, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captives of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be built upon her own heap, and the  palace shall remain after its manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them shall proceed  thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their children also shall be as afore time, and their congregation shall be established before me: and I will visite all that vexe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their  nobles shall be from themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who [is] this that engaged his  heart to approach to me? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall be my people, and I will bee your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold,  the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath done [it], and until he hath performed the intents of his heart: in the  latter days ye shall consider it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
