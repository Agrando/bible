Who is able to warre with him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him  to continue forty [and] two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name,  and his tabernacle,  and them that dwell in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was giuen vnto him to make warre with the Saints, and to ouercome them, & power was giuen him ouer euery kinred, and tongue, and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,  whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If any man have an ear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If any leade into captiuitie, hee shall go into captiuitie: if any kill with a sword, he must be killed by a sword: here is the patience and the faith of the Saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth;  and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</span> <span class="verse note empty"><a name="12">12</a>The history of the acts of this beast contains in sum three things, hypocrisy, the witness of miracles and tyranny: of which the first is noted in this verse, the second in the three verses following: the third in the sixteenth and seventeenth verses. His hypocrisy is most full of lies, by which he abuses both the former beast and the whole world: in that though he has by his cunning, as it were by line, made of the former beast a most miserable skeleton or anatomy, usurped all his authority to himself and most impudently exercises the same in the sight and view of him: yet he carries himself so as if he honoured him with most high honour, and did truly cause him to be reverenced by all men. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein For to this beast of Rome, which of civil Empire is made an ecclesiastical hierarchy, are given divine honours, and divine authority so far, as he is believed to be above the scriptures, which the gloss upon the Decretals declares by this devilish verse. «Articulos solvit, synodumque facit generalem» That is, «He changes the Articles of faith, and gives authority to general Councils.» Which is spoken of the papal power. So the beast is by birth, foundation, feat, and finally substance, one: only the Pope has altered the form and manner of it, being himself the head both of that tyrannical empire, and also of the false prophets: for the empire has he taken to himself, and to it added this cunning device. Now these words, «whose deadly wound was cured» are put here for distinction sake, as also sometimes afterwards: that even at that time the godly readers of this prophecy might by this sign be brought to see the thing as present: as if it were said, that they might adore this very empire that now is, whose head we have seen in our own memory to have been cut off, and to be cured again. to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was heal</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of] those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an  image to the  beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he had power to give  life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive  a  mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And that no man might  buy or sell, save he that had the  mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the  number of a man; and his number [is] Six hundred threescore [and] six.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
