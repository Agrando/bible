 These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And thou wast burdened, & hast patiece, and for my Names sake hast laboured, & hast not fainted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless I have [somewhat]  against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and doe the first workes: or els I will come against thee shortly, & will remooue thy candlesticke out of his place, except thou amend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the workes of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in  the midst of the  paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And unto the angel of the church in  Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have  tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt  of the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the church in  Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's seat [is]: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in  those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to  eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the  Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent thy selfe, or els I will come vnto thee shortly, and will fight against them with the sworde of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat  of the hidden  manna, and will give him a  white stone, and in the stone a new  name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto  the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know  thy works, and charity, and  service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last [to be] more than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit  fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gaue her space to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Beholde, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit fornication with her, into great affliction, except they repent them of their workes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will kill her children with death: and all the Churches shall know that I am he which searche the reines and heartes: and I will giue vnto euery one of you according vnto your workes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the  depths of Satan, as they speak; I will  put upon you none other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But that which ye haue alreadie, hold fast till I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give  power over the nations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Euen as I receiued of my Father, so will I giue him the morning starre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let him that hath an eare, heare what the Spirite saith to the Churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
