Now therefore is shown a singular work of the judgment of God belonging to the overthrow of Antichrist and his forces, of which divine work the preparation is described in this chapter: and the execution in the next. The preparation is first set down generally and in type in this verse: and is after particularly set forth in the rest of the chapter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I saw  as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and  them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name,  stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they sing  the song of Moses the  servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,  Great and marvellous [are] thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true [are] thy  ways, thou King of saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who shall not feare thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name! for thou onely art holy, and all nations shall come and worship before thee: for thy iudgements are made manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the  seven plagues, clothed in  pure and white linen, and having their breasts  girded with golden girdles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And one of the  four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power;  and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
