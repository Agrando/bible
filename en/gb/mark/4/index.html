howe then should ye vnderstand all other parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower soweth the worde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are they that receiue the seede by the wayes side, in whome the worde is sowen: but when they haue heard it, Satan commeth immediatly, and taketh away the worde that was sowen in their heartes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And likewise they that receiue the seede in stony ground, are they, which whe they haue heard the word, straightwayes receiue it with gladnesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet haue they no roote in themselues, and endure but a time: for when trouble and persecution ariseth for the worde, immediatly they be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Also they that receiue the seede among the thornes, are such as heare the word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the cares  of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they that haue receiued seede in good ground, are they that heare the worde, and receiue it, and bring foorth fruite: one corne thirtie, another sixtie, and some an hundreth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hid, that shall not be opened: neither is there a secret, but that it shall come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man haue eares to heare, let him heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For vnto him that hath, shall it be giuen, and from him that hath not, shall be taken away, euen that he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And  should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he  knoweth not how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth bringeth forth fruit  of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And assoone as the fruite sheweth it selfe, anon hee putteth in the sickle, because the haruest is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a graine of mustarde seede, which when it is sowen in the earth, is the least of all seedes that be in the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after that it is sowen, it groweth vp, and is greatest of all herbes, and beareth great branches, so that the foules of heauen may builde vnder the shadow of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them,  as they were able to hear [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he  expounded all things to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Nowe the same day when euen was come, he saide vnto them, Let vs passe ouer vnto the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they left the multitude, and tooke him as he was in the shippe, and there were also with him other little shippes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he was in the sterne asleepe on a pillow: and they awoke him, and saide to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And hee rose vp, and rebuked the winde, and saide vnto the sea, Peace, and be still. So the winde ceased, and it was a great calme.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said unto them,  Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who is this, that both the winde and sea obey him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
