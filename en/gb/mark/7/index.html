And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and  pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why  walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him  die the death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But yee say, If a man say to father or mother, Corban, that is, By the gift that is offered by mee, thou mayest haue profite, hee shall be free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So ye suffer him no more to doe any thing for his father, or his mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Making the worde of God of none authoritie, by your tradition which ye haue ordeined: and ye doe many such like things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he called the whole multitude vnto him, and sayd vnto them, Hearken you all vnto me, and vnderstand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing without a man, that can defile him, when it entreth into him: but the things which proceede out of him, are they which defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any haue eares to heare, let him heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when hee came into an house, away from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he sayde vnto them, What? Are ye without vnderstanding also? Doe ye not knowe that whatsoeuer thing from without entreth into a man, cannot defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught,  purging all meats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he sayd, That which commeth out of man, that defileth man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, euen out of the heart of men, proceede euill thoughtes, adulteries, fornications, murthers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thefts,  covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an  evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these euill things come from within, and defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And from thence he arose, and went into the  borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a certaine woman, whose litle daughter had an vncleane spirit, heard of him, and came, and fell at his feete,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The woman was a  Greek, a  Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] unto the  dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And she answered and said unto him,  Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said vnto her, For this saying goe thy way: the deuil is gone out of thy daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when shee was come home to her house, shee founde the deuill departed, and her daughter lying on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of  Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they brought vnto him one that was deafe and stambered in his speache, and prayed him to put his hand vpon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then hee tooke him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers in his eares, and did spit, and touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking vp to heauen, hee sighed, and said vnto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And straightway his eares were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and hee spake plaine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he commanded them, that they should tell no man: but howe much soeuer hee forbad them, the more a great deale they published it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And were beyonde measure astonied, saying, Hee hath done all thinges well: he maketh both the deafe to heare, & the domme to speake.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
