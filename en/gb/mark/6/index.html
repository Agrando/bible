And they were offended at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without  honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he  could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he marueiled at their vnbeliefe, and went about by ye townes on euery side, teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he called [unto him] the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And commanded them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in [their] purse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But [be] shod with  sandals; and not put on  two coats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house,  there abide till ye depart from that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went out, and preached, that men should amend their liues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cast out many devils, and  anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And king Herod heard [of him]; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty  works do shew forth themselves in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of  the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard [thereof], he said, It is John, whom I  beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod him selfe had sent forth, & had taken Iohn, and bound him in prison for Herodias sake, which was his brother Philippes wife, because he had maried her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Iohn sayd vnto Herod, It is not lawfull for thee to haue thy brothers wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Herodias  had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him  gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the time being conuenient, when Herod on his birth day made a banket to his princes and captaines, and chiefe estates of Galile:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the daughter  of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give [it] thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he sware vnto her, Whatsoeuer thou shalt aske of me, I will giue it thee, euen vnto the halfe of my kingdome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And  she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then she came in straightway with haste vnto the King, & asked, saying, I would that thou shouldest giue me euen now in a charger the head of Iohn Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the King was very sory: yet for his othes sake, and for their sakes which sate at table with him, he would not refuse her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately the king sent an  executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And brought his head in a charger, and gaue it to the maide, and the maide gaue it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when his disciples heard it, they came and tooke vp his body, and put it in a tombe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Apostles gathered themselues together to Iesus, and tolde him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they went by ship out of the way into a desart place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the people sawe them when they departed, and many knewe him, and ran a foote thither out of all cities, and came thither before them, and assembled vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Iesus went out, and sawe a great multitude, and had compassion on them, because they were like sheepe which had no shepheard: and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the day was nowe farre spent, his disciples came vnto him, saying, This is a desart place, and nowe the day is farre passed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Let them depart, that they may goe into the countrey and townes about, and buy them bread: for they haue nothing to eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him,  Shall we go and buy  two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he sayde vnto them, Howe many loaues haue ye? Goe and looke; when they knewe it, they sayd, Fiue, and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he commanded them to make all sit down by  companies upon the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they sat down in  ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he tooke the fiue loaues, and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen, and gaue thanks, and brake the loaues, and gaue them to his disciples to set before them, and the two fishes he deuided among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So they did all eate, and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they tooke vp twelue baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they that had eaten, were about fiue thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when he had sent  them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when euen was come, the ship was in the mids of the sea, and he alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he saw them troubled in rowing, (for the winde was contrary vnto them) and about the fourth watch of the night, hee came vnto them, walking vpon the sea, and would haue passed by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And when they saw him walking vpon the sea, they supposed it had bene a spirit, & cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For they all saw him, and were sore afrayd: but anon he talked with them, & said vnto them, Be ye of good comfort: it is I, be not afrayd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were  sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For they  considered not [the miracle] of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they came ouer, and went into the land of Gennesaret, and arriued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And ran about throughout all that region round about, and began to cary hither & thither in couches all that were sicke, where they heard that he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched  him were made whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
