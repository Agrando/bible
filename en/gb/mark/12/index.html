A [certain] man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about [it], and digged [a place for] the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But they tooke him, and beat him, & sent him away emptie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And againe he sent vnto them another seruant, and at him they cast stones, and brake his head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And againe he sent another, and him they slew, & many other, beating some, & killing some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet had he one sonne, his deare beloued: him also he sent the last vnto them, saying, They will reuerence my sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But ye husbandmen said among themselues, This is the heire: come, let vs kill him, and the inheritance shalbe ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they tooke him, & killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What shall then the Lord of the vineyard doe? He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and giue the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Haue ye not read so much as this Scripture? The stone which the builders did refuse, is made the head of the corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This was done of the Lord, and it is marueilous in our eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they  sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in [his] words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou  regardest not the person of men, but teachest the  way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Should we giue it, or should we not giue it? But he knew their hypocrisie, and said vnto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me a peny, that I may see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they brought it, and he said vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said vnto him, Cesars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Giue to Cesar the things that are Cesars, and to God, those that are Gods: & they marueiled at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die, and leaue his wife, and leaue no children, that his brother should take his wife, and rayse vp seede vnto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There were seuen brethren, and the first tooke a wife, and when he died, left no issue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the seconde tooke her, and he died, neither did he yet leaue issue, & the third likewise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So those seuen had her, and left no yssue: last of all the wife died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection then, when they shall rise againe, whose wife shall she be of them? For seuen had her to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Are ye not therefore deceiued, because ye knowe not the Scriptures, neither the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when they shall rise againe from the dead, neither men marry, nor wiues are married, but are as the Angels which are in heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as touching the dead, that they shall rise againe, haue ye not read in the booke of Moses, howe in the bush God spake vnto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>God is not ye God of the dead, but the God of the liuing. Ye are therefore greatly deceiued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Iesus answered him, The first of all the commandements is, Heare, Israel, The Lord our God is the onely Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thou shalt therefore loue the Lorde thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy minde, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the second is like, that is, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe. There is none other commandement greater then these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then that Scribe said vnto him, Well, Master, thou hast saide the trueth, that there is one God, and that there is none but he,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And to loue him with all the heart, and with all the vnderstanding, and with all the soule, and with all the strength, and to loue his neighbour as himselfe, is more then all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then when Iesus saw that he answered discreetely, he saide vnto him, Thou art not farre from the kingdome of God; no man after that durst aske him any question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David himself said by  the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Dauid himselfe calleth him Lord: by what meanes is he then his sonne? And much people heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said unto them in  his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in  long clothing, and [love] salutations in the marketplaces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the chiefe seates in the Synagogues, and the first roumes at feastes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Which deuoure widowes houses, euen vnder a colour of long prayers. These shall receiue the greater damnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people  cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And there came a certaine poore widowe, & she threw in two mites, which make a quadrin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then he called vnto him his disciples, and said vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, that this poore widowe hath cast more in, then all they which haue cast into the treasurie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For they all did cast in of their superfluitie: but she of her pouertie did cast in all that she had, euen all her liuing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
