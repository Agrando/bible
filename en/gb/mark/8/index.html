And they said, Seuen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he commaunded the multitude to sit downe on the grounde: and hee tooke the seuen loaues, and gaue thankes, brake them, and gaue to his disciples to set before them, and they did set them before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They had also a few small fishes: and when he had giuen thankes, he commaunded them also to be set before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they did eate, and were sufficed, and they tooke vp of the broken meate that was left, seuen baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(And they that had eaten, were about foure thousand) so he sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And anon he entred into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Pharisees  came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he  sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you,  There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he left them, and went into the ship againe, and departed to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the shippe with them, but one loafe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Iesus knew it, he said vnto them, Why reason you thus, because ye haue no bread? perceiue ye not yet, neither vnderstande? haue ye your hearts yet hardened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Haue yee eyes, and see not? and haue yee eares, and heare not? and doe ye not remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When I brake the fiue loaues among fiue thousand, how many baskets full of broken meate tooke ye vp? They said vnto him, Twelue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when I brake seuen among foure thousande, howe many baskets of the leauings of broken meate tooke ye vp? And they said, Seuen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said unto them,  How is it that ye do not understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he tooke the blinde by the hand, and ledde him out of the towne, and spat in his eyes, and put his handes vpon him, and asked him, if he sawe ought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he looked up, and said, I  see men as trees, walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him  look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered, Some say, Iohn Baptist: and some, Elias: and some, one of the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said vnto them, But whome say ye that I am? Then Peter answered, and saide vnto him, Thou art that Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou  savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: but whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels, he shall saue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Or what exchange shall a man giue for his soule?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For whosoeuer shall be ashamed of mee, and of my wordes among this adulterous and sinfull generation, of him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed also, when he commeth in the glorie of his Father with the holy Angels.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
