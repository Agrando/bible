Go and sell all that thou hast, and giue to the poore, & thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come, followe me, and take vp the crosse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But hee was sad at that saying, and went away sorowfull: for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Iesus looked round about, & sayd vnto his disciples, Howe hardly doe they that haue riches, enter into the kingdome of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his disciples were afraide at his words. But Iesus answered againe, and sayd vnto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdome of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were much more astonied, saying with themselues, Who then can be saued?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Iesus looked vpon them, & sayd, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Iesus answered, and sayd, Verely I say vnto you, there is no man that hath forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my sake and the Gospels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he shall receive an  hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands,  with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many that are first, shall be last, and the last, first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Saying, Beholde, we goe vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall be deliuered vnto the hie Priests, and to the Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death, and shall deliuer him to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they shall mocke him, and scourge him, and spit vpon him, and kill him: but the third day he shall rise againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master,  we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he sayd vnto them, What would ye I should doe for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they said to him, Graunt vnto vs, that we may sit, one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Iesus sayd vnto them, Ye knowe not what ye aske. Can ye drinke of the cup that I shal drinke of, and be baptized with the baptisme that I shall be baptized with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said vnto him, We can. But Iesus sayd vnto them, Ye shall drinke in deede of the cup that I shall drinke of, and be baptized with the baptisme wherewith I shalbe baptized:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But to sit at my right hand, and at my left, is not mine to giue, but it shalbe giuen to them for whome it is prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard that, they began to disdaine at Iames and Iohn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Jesus called them [to him], and saith unto them, Ye know that  they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But it shal not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, shall be your seruant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whosoeuer will be chiefe of you, shall be the seruant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For euen the Sonne of man came not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the raunsome of many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when hee heard that it was Iesus of Nazareth, he began to crye, and to say, Iesus the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many rebuked him, because he should holde his peace: but hee cryed much more, O Sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then Iesus stood still, & commanded him to be called: and they called the blind, saying vnto him, Be of good comfort: arise, he calleth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So he threwe away his cloke, and rose, and came to Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Iesus answered, & said vnto him, What wilt thou that I doe vnto thee? And the blinde sayd vnto him, Lorde, that I may receiue sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Iesus sayde vnto him, Goe thy way: thy fayth hath saued thee; by and by, he receiued his sight, and folowed Iesus in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
