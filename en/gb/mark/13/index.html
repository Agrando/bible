There shall not be left one stone vpon a stone, that shall not be throwen downe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And as he sate on the mount of Oliues, ouer against the Temple, Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and Andrew asked him secretly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell vs, when shall these things be? And what shalbe the signe when all these things shalbe fulfilled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Iesus answered them, & began to say, Take heede lest any man deceiue you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For many shall come in my Name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceiue many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Furthermore when ye shall heare, of warres, & rumours of warres, be ye not troubled: for such things must needes be: but the end shall not be yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation shal rise against nation, & kingdome against kingdome, and there shalbe earthquakes in diuers quarters, and there shalbe famine and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorowes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a  testimony against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Gospel must first be published among all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they shall lead [you], and deliver you up,  take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither  do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, and the brother shall deliuer the brother to death, and the father the sonne, and the children shall rise against their parents, and shall cause them to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall be hated of all [men]  for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet,  standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And let him that is vpon the house, not come downe into the house, neither enter therein, to fetch any thing out of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let him that is in the fielde, not turne backe againe to take his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then wo shalbe to the that are with child, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray therefore that your flight be not in the winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For [in]  those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And except that the Lorde had shortened those dayes, no flesh shoulde be saued: but for the elects sake, which he hath chosen, he hath shortened those dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then if any man say to you, Loe, here is Christ, or, lo, he is there, beleeue it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For false Christes shall rise, and false prophets, and shall shewe signes and wonders, to deceiue if it were possible the very elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But take ye heede: beholde, I haue shewed you all things before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Moreouer in those dayes, after that tribulation, the sunne shall waxe darke, and ye moone shall not giue her light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the starres of heauen shall fall: and the powers which are in heauen, shall shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then shall they see the Sonne of man comming in ye cloudes, with great power & glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he shall then send his Angels, & shal gather together his elect from the foure windes, and from the vtmost part of the earth to the vtmost part of heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nowe learne a parable of the figge tree.
