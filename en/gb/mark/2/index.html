And he arose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to passe, as Iesus sate at table in his house, many Publicanes & sinners sate at table also with Iesus, and his disciples: for there were many that followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the Scribes and Pharises sawe him eate with the Publicanes and sinners, they sayd vnto his disciples, Howe is it, that hee eateth and drinketh with Publicanes and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now when Iesus heard it, hee sayde vnto them, The whole haue no neede of the Physicion, but the sicke. I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Iesus saide vnto them, Can the children of the marriage chamber fast, whiles the bridegrome is with them? as long as they haue the bridegrome with them, they cannot fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the daies will come, when the bridegrome shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast in those daies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also no man soweth a piece of newe cloth in an olde garment: for els the newe piece that filled it vp, taketh away somewhat from the olde, and the breach is worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Likewise, no man putteth newe wine into old vessels: for els the new wine breaketh the vessels, and the wine runneth out, and the vessels are lost: but newe wine must be put into new vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the  sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharises saide vnto him, Beholde, why doe they on the Sabbath day, that which is not lawfull?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he saide to them, Haue yee neuer read what Dauid did when he had neede, and was an hungred, both he, and they that were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How he went into the house of God in the days of  Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And hee sayde to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the  sabbath.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
