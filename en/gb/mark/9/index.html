Bring him vnto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him unto him: and when he  saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he asked his father, How long time is it since he hath bin thus? And he said, Of a childe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And oft times he casteth him into the fire, & into the water to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, helpe vs, and haue compassion vpo vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe,  all things [are] possible to him that believeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And straightway the father of the childe crying with teares, saide, Lorde, I beleeue: helpe my vnbeliefe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Iesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the vncleane spirit, saying vnto him, Thou domme & deafe spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, & enter no more into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And [the spirit] cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Iesus tooke his hande, and lift him vp, and he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he saide vnto them, This kinde can by no other meanes come foorth, but by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they departed thence, and  passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they vnderstoode not that saying, and were afraide to aske him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he came to Capernaum: and being in the  house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they helde their peace: for by the way they reasoned among themselues, who should bee the chiefest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sate downe, and called the twelue, and said to them, If any man desire to be first, the same shalbe last of all, and seruant vnto all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he tooke a litle childe, and set him in the middes of them, and tooke him in his armes, and sayd vnto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not  me, but him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Iesus sayd, Forbid him not: for there is no man that can doe a miracle by my Name, that can lightly speake euill of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For whosoeuer is not against vs, is on our part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whosoeuer shall giue you a cup of water to drinke for my Names sake, because ye belong to Christ, verely I say vnto you, he shall not lose his rewarde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whosoever shall offend one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Wherefore, if thine hand cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life, maimed, then hauing two hands, to goe into hell, into the fire that neuer shalbe quenched,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Where their  worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Likewise, if thy foote cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to go halt into life, then hauing two feete, to be cast into hell, into the fire that neuer shalbe quenched,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Where their worme dyeth not, & the fire neuer goeth out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if thine eye cause thee to offende, plucke it out: it is better for thee to goe into the kingdome of God with one eye, then hauing two eyes, to be cast into hell fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Where their worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer goeth out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For every one shall be  salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good: but if the salt be vnsauerie, wherewith shall it be seasoned? haue salt in your selues, and haue peace one with another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
