And they murmured against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Iesus saide, Let her alone: why trouble yee her? Shee hath wrought a good worke on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Verely I say vnto you, wheresoeuer this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done, shalbe spoken of in remembrance of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised that they woulde giue him monie: therefore he sought howe he might conueniently betraie him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the first day of unleavened bread,  when  they killed the  passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then hee sent foorth two of his disciples, and sayde vnto them, Goe yee into the citie, and there shall a man meete you bearing a pitcher of water: followe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whithersoeuer he goeth in, say yee to the good man of the house, The Master sayeth, Where is the lodging where I shal eate the Passeouer with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will shew you a large  upper room furnished [and] prepared: there make ready for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So his disciples went foorth, and came to the citie, and found as he had said vnto them, and made readie the Passeouer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And at euen he came with the twelue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they began to be sorowful & to say to him one by one, Is it I? And another, Is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he answered and said unto them, [It is] one of the twelve, that  dippeth with me in the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Truly the Sonne of man goeth his way, as it is written of him: but woe bee to that man, by whome the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had beene good for that man, if hee had neuer beene borne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as they did eate, Iesus tooke the bread, and when hee had giuen thankes, he brake it and gaue it to them, and sayde, Take, eate, this is my bodie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Also he tooke the cuppe, and when he had giuen thankes, gaue it to them: and they all dranke of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he saide vnto them, This is my blood of that newe Testament, which is shed for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Verely I say vnto you, I wil drinke no more of the fruit of ye vine vntill that day, that I drinke it newe in the kingdome of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when they had sung a Psalme, they went out to the mount of Oliues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after that I am risen, I will goe into Galile before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet [will] not I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Iesus saide vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, this day, euen in this night, before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt denie me thrise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he spake the  more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And hee tooke with him Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and hee began to be troubled, and in great heauinesse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And saide vnto them, My soule is very heauie, euen vnto the death: tarie here, and watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So he went forward a litle, and fell downe on the ground, and praied, that if it were possible, that houre might passe from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said,  Abba, Father, all things [are] possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Watch ye, and pray, that ye enter not into tentation: the spirite in deede is ready, but the flesh is weake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And againe hee went away, and praied, and spake the same wordes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he returned, & founde them a sleepe againe: for their eyes were heauie: neither knewe they what they should answere him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he came the third time, and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth, and take your rest: it is ynough: the houre is come: beholde, the Sonne of man is deliuered into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Rise vp: let vs go: loe, he that betraieth me, is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead [him] away  safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And assoone as hee was come, hee went straightway to him, and saide, Haile Master, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then they laide their handes on him, and tooke him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And  one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Iesus answered and saide to them, Ye be come out as against a thiefe with swordes, and with staues, to take me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I was daily with you teaching in the Temple, and yee tooke me not: but this is done that the Scriptures should be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they  all forsook him, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And there followed him a certain young man, having a  linen cloth cast about [his] naked [body]; and the young men laid hold on him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he left his linnen cloth, and fled from them naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were  assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Peter folowed him afarre off, euen into the hall of the hie Priest, and sate with the seruants, and warmed himselfe at the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For many bare false witnesse against him, but their witnesse agreed not together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then there arose certaine, and bare false witnesse against him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>We hearde him say, I will destroy this Temple made with hands, & within three daies I will builde another, made without hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>But their witnesse yet agreed not together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Then the hie Priest stoode vp amongst them, and asked Iesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? What is the matter that these beare witnesse against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the  Blessed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Iesus said, I am he, and yee shall see the Sonne of man sitte at the right hande of the power of God, and come in the clouds of heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the hie Priest rent his clothes, and sayd, What haue we any more neede of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Ye haue heard the blasphemie: what thinke yee? And they all condemned him to be worthie of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And when shee sawe Peter warming him selfe, shee looked on him, and sayde, Thou wast also with Iesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied it, saying, I knowe him not, neither wot I what thou saiest. Then he went out into the porche, and the cocke crewe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And  a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is [one] of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But hee denied it againe: and anon after, they that stoode by, sayde againe to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art of Galile, and thy speach is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And he began to curse, and sweare, saying, I knowe not this man of whom ye speake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Then the seconde time the cocke crewe, and Peter remembred the woorde that Iesus had saide vnto him, Before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt denie me thrise, and waying that with himselfe, he wept.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
