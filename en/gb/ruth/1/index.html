And a certain man of  Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi: and the names of his two sonnes, Mahlon, and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem Iudah: and when they came into the land of Moab, they continued there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Elimelech the husbande of Naomi died, and she remayned with her two sonnes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they took them wives of the  women of Moab; the name of the one [was] Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Mahlon and Chilion dyed also both twaine: so the woman was left destitute of her two sonnes, and of her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had  visited his people in giving them bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore shee departed out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her, and they went on their way to returne vnto the land of Iudah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Naomi saide vnto her two daughters in lawe, Goe, returne eche of you vnto her owne mothers house: the Lord shew fauour vnto you, as ye haue done with the dead, and with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The LORD grant you that ye may find  rest, each [of you] in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they saide vnto her, Surely we will returne with thee vnto thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Naomi saide, Turne againe, my daughters: for what cause will you go with me? are there any mo sonnes in my wombe, that they may bee your husbands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Turne againe, my daughters: go your way: for I am too olde to haue an husband. If I should say, I haue hope, and if I had an husbad this night: yea, if I had borne sonnes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Would yee tarie for them, till they were of age? would ye be deferred for them from taking of husbands? nay my daughters: for it grieueth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lorde is gone out against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah  kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods:  return thou after thy sister in law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ruth answered, Intreate mee not to leaue thee, nor to depart from thee: for whither thou goest, I will goe: and where thou dwellest, I will dwell: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried. the Lord do so to me and more also, if ought but death depart thee and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whe she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left speaking vnto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was  moved about them, and they said, [Is] this Naomi?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she answered them, Call me not Naomi, but call me Mara: for the Almightie hath giuen me much bitternes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I went out full, and the Lorde hath caused me to returne emptie: why call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath humbled me, and the Almightie hath brought me vnto aduersitie?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of  barley harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
