And he turned aside, and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then he tooke ten men of the Elders of the citie, and sayd, Sit ye downe here; they sate downe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said vnto ye kinsman, Naomi, that is come againe out of ye countrey of Moab, wil sell a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelechs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy [it] before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem [it], redeem [it]: but if thou wilt not redeem [it, then] tell me, that I may know: for [there is] none to redeem [it]  beside thee; and I [am] after thee. And he said, I will redeem [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy [it] also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his  inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the kinsman answered, I can not redeeme it, lest I destroy mine owne inheritance: redeeme my right to thee, for I can not redeeme it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now this [was the manner] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave [it] to his neighbour: and this [was] a  testimony in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore the kinsman sayd to Boas, Buy it for thee: and he drew off his shooe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Boaz sayd vnto the Elders & vnto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I haue bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons, of the hand of Naomi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his  place: ye [are] witnesses this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people that [were] in the gate, and the elders, said, [We are] witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in  Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And that thine house be like the house of Pharez ( whom Thamar bare vnto Iudah) of the seede which the Lord shall giue thee of this yong woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Boaz tooke Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in vnto her, the Lorde gaue that she conceiued, and bare a sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed [be] the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that  his name may be famous in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he shall be unto thee a restorer of [thy] life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than  seven sons, hath born him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Naomi tooke the childe, and layde it in her lap, and became nource vnto it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the women her neighbours gaue it a name, saying, There is a childe borne to Naomi, and called the name thereof Obed: the same was the father of Ishai, the father of Dauid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now these [are] the generations of  Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hezron begate Ram, & Ram begate Amminadab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Amminadab begate Nahshon, and Nahshon begate Salmah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Salmon begate Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Obed begate Ishai, and Ishai begate Dauid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
