[even] that which hath been already done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw that there is profite in wisdome, more then in follie: as the light is more excellent then darkenes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wise man's  eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one  event happeneth to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I thought in mine heart, It befalleth vnto me, as it befalleth to ye foole. Why therefore doe I then labour to be more wise? And I sayd in mine heart, that this also is vanitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool  for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And  how dieth the wise [man]? as the fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I hated life: for the worke that is wrought vnder the sunne is grieuous vnto me: for all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I hated also all my labour, wherein I had trauailed vnder the sunne, which I shall leaue to the man that shalbe after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knoweth whether he shalbe wise or foolish? yet shall hee haue rule ouer all my labour, wherein I haue trauailed, and wherein I haue shewed my selfe wise vnder the sunne. This is also vanitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore I went about to cause my heart  to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured in it shall he  leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what hath man of all his trauaile and griefe of his heart, wherein he hath trauailed vnder the sunne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his dayes are sorowes, and his trauaile griefe: his heart also taketh not rest in the night: which also is vanitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should  make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who can eat, or who else can hasten  [to it], more than I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Surely to a man that is good in his sight, God giueth wisdome, and knowledge, and ioy: but to the sinner he giueth paine, to gather, and to heape to giue to him that is good before God: this is also vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
