Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they [are] not all  Israel, which are of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, [are they] all children:  but, In  Isaac shall thy seed be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, They which are the children of the  flesh, these [are] not the children of God: but the children of the  promise are counted for the seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this [is] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only [this]; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(For [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the  purpose of God according to election might  stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written, I haue loued Iacob, and haue hated Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we say then? [Is there]  unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he saith to Moses, I will  have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have  compassion on whom I will have compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then [it is] not of him that  willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the  scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I  raised thee up, that I might  shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he  will [have mercy], and whom he will he hardeneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?  Shall the thing  formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one  vessel unto  honour, and another unto  dishonour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[What] if God, willing to shew [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the  vessels of wrath fitted to  destruction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And that he might make known the  riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Even us, whom he hath called, not of the  Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shalbe in the place where it was said vnto them, Ye are not my people, that there they shalbe called, The children of the liuing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he will finish the work, and cut [it]  short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of  Sabaoth had left us a  seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed  not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the  works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As it is written, Beholde, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone, and a rocke to make men fall: and euery one that beleeueth in him, shall not be ashamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
