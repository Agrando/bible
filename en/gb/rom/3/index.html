[Is] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as  a man)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God forbid: els how shal God iudge ye world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if the  truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And (as we are blamed, & as some affirme, that we say) why doe we not euil, that good may come thereof? whose damnation is iust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? are we better [than they]? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all  under sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is none that vnderstandeth: there is none that seeketh God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They haue all gone out of the way: they haue bene made altogether vnprofitable: there is none that doeth good, no not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throte is an open sepulchre: they haue vsed their tongues to deceit: the poyson of aspes is vnder their lippes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitternesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feete are swift to shead blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction & calamity are in their waies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the  way of peace have they not known:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The feare of God is not before their eies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that what things soever the  law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that  every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become  guilty before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore by the  deeds of the law there shall no  flesh be  justified in his  sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of  Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all have sinned, and come short of the  glory of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Being justified  freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his  blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that  are past, through the  forbearance of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To declare, [I say],  at this time his righteousness: that he might be  just, and the  justifier of him which  believeth in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what  law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore we conclude, that a man is iustified by faith, without the workes of the Lawe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[Is he] the God of the  Jews only? [is he] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify  the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make  void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we  establish the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
