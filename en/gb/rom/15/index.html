but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For whatsoever things were written  aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the  scriptures might have hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That ye with one minde, and with one mouth may prayse God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also  received us to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the  circumcision for the  truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] unto the fathers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And that the Gentiles might glorify God for [his] mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will  confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And againe he saith, Reioyce, ye Gentiles with his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And againe, Prayse the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and laude ye him, all people together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And againe Esaias sayth, There shall be a roote of Iesse, and hee that shall rise to reigne ouer the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the God of  hope fill you with  all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that  ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neuerthelesse, brethren, I haue somewhat boldly after a sort written vnto you, as one that putteth you in remembrance, through the grace that is giuen me of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the  offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which  Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Through  mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yea, so I enforced my selfe to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should haue built on another mans foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as it is written, To whome hee was not spoken of, they shall see him, and they that heard not, shall vnderstand him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But nowe seeing I haue no more place in these quarters, and also haue bene desirous many yeeres agone to come vnto you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When I shal take my iourney into Spaine, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my iourney, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, after that I haue bene somewhat filled with your company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I go unto Jerusalem to  minister unto the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia, to make a certaine distribution vnto the poore Saints which are at Hierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to  minister unto them in carnal things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When therefore I have performed this, and have  sealed to them this  fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the  love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That I may be deliuered from them which are disobedient in Iudea, & that my seruice which I haue to doe at Hierusalem, may be accepted of the Saintes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That I may come vnto you with ioy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
