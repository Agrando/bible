to the Jew first, and also to the  Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from  faith to faith:  as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against  all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the  truth in unrighteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in  them; for God hath shewed [it] unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being  understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because that, when they knew God, they  glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became  vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And changed the glory of the  uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore  God also  gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Which turned the trueth of God vnto a lie, and worshipped and serued the creature, forsaking the Creator, which is blessed for euer, Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this cause God gaue them vp vnto vile affections: for euen their women did change the naturall vse into that which is against nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that  recompence of their error which was meet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a  reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being full of all vnrighteousnesse, fornication, wickednes, couetousnes, maliciousnes, full of enuie, of murther, of debate, of deceit, taking all things in the euill part, whisperers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Backbiters, haters of God, doers of wrong, proude, boasters, inuenters of euil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Without understanding,  covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who knowing the  judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but  have pleasure in them that do them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
