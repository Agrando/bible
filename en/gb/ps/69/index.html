for the  waters are come in unto [my] soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I sink in deep mire, where [there is] no  standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine  eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, [being] mine enemies  wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored [that] which I  took not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, thou knowest my  foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for  my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For thy sake haue I suffred reproofe: shame hath couered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am become a stranger vnto my brethren, euen an aliant vnto my mothers sonnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When I  wept, [and chastened] my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I put on a sacke also: and I became a prouerbe vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They that  sit in the gate speak against me; and I [was] the song of the drunkards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for me, my prayer [is] unto thee, O LORD, [in] an  acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the  deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not the water flood drowne mee, neither let the deepe swallowe me vp: and let not the pit shut her mouth vpon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Heare me, O Lord, for thy louing kindnes is good: turne vnto me according to ye multitude of thy tender mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And  hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw neere vnto my soule and redeeme it: deliuer me because of mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine  adversaries [are] all before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and  I looked [for some] to take pity, but [there was] none; and for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For they gaue me gall in my meate, and in my thirst they gaue me vineger to drinke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let their  table become a snare before them: and [that which should have been] for [their] welfare, [let it become] a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their  loins continually to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Powre out thine anger vpon them, and let thy wrathfull displeasure take them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let their  habitation be desolate; [and] let none dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they persecute him, whome thou hast smitten: and they adde vnto the sorrowe of them, whome thou hast wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Add  iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the  book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When I am poore and in heauinesse, thine helpe, O God, shall exalt me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the Name of God with a song, and magnifie him with thankesgiuing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[This] also shall please the LORD better than an ox [or]  bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The humble shall see this, and they that seeke God, shalbe glad, and your heart shall liue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his  prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let heauen and earth praise him: the seas and all that moueth in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will saue Zion, and builde the cities of Iudah, that men may dwell there and haue it in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The  seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
