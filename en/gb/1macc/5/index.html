Gazer with the townes thereof, and so turned againe into Iudea.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 Then the heathen that were in Galaad, gathered them together against the Israelites

all in one day.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 So Iudas and his host turned in all haste by the way of the wildernesse towarde Bosorra, and wanne the citie, and slewe all the males with the edge of the sword, and tooke all their spoyle, and set fire vpon the citie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 And in the night he remooued from thence, and went toward the fortresse.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 And betimes in the morning when they looked vp, beholde, there was an innumerable people bearing ladders, and instruments of warre, to take the forte, and had assaulted them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 When Iudas sawe that the battel was begun, & that the cry of the citie went vp to heauen with trumpets, and a great sound,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 Then he said vnto the armie, Fight this day for your brethren.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>{\cf2 So he went foorth behinde them with three companies, and they blewe the trumpets, and cryed with prayer.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>{\cf2 Then the host of Timotheus knew, that it was Maccabeus, and they fled from him, and hee smote them with a great slaughter, so that there was killed of them the same day, almost eight thousand men.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>{\cf2 Then departed Iudas vnto Maspha, & laid siege vnto it, and wanne it, and slewe all the males thereof, and spoyled it, and set fire vpon it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>{\cf2 From thence went he and tooke Chasbon, Maged, and Bosor, and the other cities in Galaad.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>{\cf2 After these things gathered Timotheus another hoste, and he camped before Raphon beyond the flood.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>{\cf2 Now Iudas had sent to espie the host, and they brought him word againe, saying, All the heathen that bee rounde about vs, are gathered vnto him, and the host is very great,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>{\cf2 And hee hath hired the Arabians to helpe them, and they haue pitched their tents beyond the flood, and are ready to come and fight against thee. So Iudas went to meete them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>{\cf2 Then Timotheus said vnto the captaines of his host, When Iudas and his host come neere the flood, if he passe ouer first vnto vs, we shal not be able to withstand him: for he wil be too strog for vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>{\cf2 But if he be afraide, and campe beyond the flood, we wil goe ouer vnto him, and shall preuaile against him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>{\cf2 Now when Iudas came neere to ye flood, hee caused the gouernours of ye people to remayne by the flood, & commanded them, saying, Suffer none to pitch a tent, but let euery man come to ye battel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>{\cf2 So he went first ouer toward them, & all the people after him: & all the heathen were discofited before him, and cast away their weapons, and fled into the Temple that was at Carnaim.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>{\cf2 Which citie Iudas wanne, and burnt the temple with all that were in it: so was Carnaim subdued, and might not withstand Iudas.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>{\cf2 Then Iudas gathered all the Israelites that were in the countrey of Galaad, from the least vnto the most, with their wiues and their children, and their baggage, a very great hoste, to come into the land of Iuda.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>{\cf2 So they came vnto Ephron, which was a great citie by the way, and strongly defensed: they coulde not passe, neither at the right hande nor at the left, but must goe thorow it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>{\cf2 But they that were in the citie, shutte themselues in, & stopped vp the gates with stones: & Iudas sent vnto them with peaceable wordes, saying,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>{\cf2 Let vs passe thorowe your land, that we may goe into our owne countrey, and none shall hurt you: we will but onely goe thorowe on foote: but they would not open vnto him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>{\cf2 Wherefore Iudas commaunded a proclamation to bee made throughout the hoste, that euery man should assault it according to his standing.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>{\cf2 So the valiant men set vpon it, and assaulted the citie all that day, and all that night, and the citie was giuen ouer into his handes:}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>{\cf2 Who slew all the males with the edge of the sworde, and destroyed it, and tooke the spoile thereof, and went thorowe the citie ouer them that were slaine.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>{\cf2 Then went they ouer Iorden into the great plaine before Bethsan.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>{\cf2 And Iudas gathered together those that were behinde, & gaue the people good exhortation all the way thorow, til they were come into ye land of Iuda.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>{\cf2 Thus they went vp with ioye, and gladnesse vnto mount Sion, where they offred burnt offrings, because there were none of them slaine, but came home againe in safetie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>{\cf2 Nowe whilest Iudas and Ionathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon their brother in Galile before Ptolemais,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>{\cf2 Ioseph the sonne of Zacharias, and Azarias the captaines, hearing of the valiant actes, and battels which they had atchieued, said,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>{\cf2 Let vs get vs a name also, and go fight against the heathen that are round about vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>{\cf2 So they gaue their hoste a commaundement and went toward Iamnia.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>{\cf2 But Gorgias and his men came out of the citie to fight against them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>{\cf2 And Ioseph and Azarias were put to flight, and pursued vnto the borders of Iudea: and there were slaine that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men: so that there was a great ouerthrow among the people of Israel,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>{\cf2 Because they were not obedient vnto Iudas, and his brethren, but thought to doe some valiant thing.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>{\cf2 Also they came not of ye stocke of these men, by whose handes deliuerance was giuen to Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>{\cf2 But the man Iudas, & his brethre were greatly commended in the sight of all Israel, & of all the heathen, wheresoeuer their name was heard of.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>{\cf2 And the people came vnto them, bidding them welcome.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>{\cf2 Afterwarde went Iudas foorth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land towarde the South, where hee wanne Hebron, & the townes thereof, and he destroyed the castel thereof, and burnt the towers thereof round about.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>{\cf2 Then remooued hee to goe into the lande of the strangers, and went thorowe Samaria.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>{\cf2 At the same time were the Priests of the cities slaine in the battel, which would shewe their valiantnes, and went forth to battel without counsell: and when Iudas came to Azotus in the strangers lande, he brake down their altars, and burnt with fire the images of their gods, and tooke away the spoyles of the cities, and came againe into the lande of Iuda.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
