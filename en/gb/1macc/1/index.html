left waste as a wildernes: her holy dayes were turned into mourning, her Sabbaths into reproche, and her honour brought to naught.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>{\cf2 As her glory had bene great, so was her dishonour, & her excellencie was turned into sorowe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>{\cf2 Also the King wrote vnto all his kingdome, that all the people should be as one, and that euery man should leaue his lawes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>{\cf2 And all the heathen agreed to the commandement of the King.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>{\cf2 Yea, many of the Israelites consented to his religion, offring vnto idoles, & defiling ye Sabbath.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>{\cf2 So the King sent letters

Israelites into secret places, euen wheresoeuer they could flee for succour.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>{\cf2 The fifteenth day of Casleu, in the hundreth and fiue and fourtieth yeere, they set vp the abomination of desolation vpon the altar, and they buylded altars throughout the cities of Iuda on euery side.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>{\cf2 And before the doores of the houses, and in the streetes they burnt incense.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>{\cf2 And the bookes of the Lawe, which they found, they burnt in the fire, and cut in pieces.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>{\cf2 Whosoeuer had a booke of the Testament founde by him, or whosoeuer consented vnto the Lawe, the Kings commaundement was, that they should

cities.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>{\cf2 And in the fiue & twentieth day of the moneth, they did sacrifice vpon the altar, which was in the stead of the altar of sacrifices.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>{\cf2 And according to the commandement, they put certeine women to death, which had caused their children to be circumcised,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>{\cf2 And they hanged vp the children at their neckes, and they spoyled their houses, and slew the circumcisers of them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>{\cf2 Yet were there many in Israel, which were of courage, and determined in themselues, that they would not eate vncleane things,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>{\cf2 But chose rather to suffer death, the to be defiled with those meates: so because they would not breake the holy couenant, they were put to death.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>{\cf2
