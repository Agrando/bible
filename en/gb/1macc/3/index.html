his sonne, called Maccabeus, rose vp in his place.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 And all his brethren helped him, and all they that held with his father, and fought with courage the battell of Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 So he gate his people great honour: he put on a breastplate as a gyant, and armed himselfe, and set the battell in array, and defended the campe with the sword.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 In his actes he was like a Lion, and as a Lyons whelpe roaring after the pray.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 For he pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt vp those that vexed his people,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 So that the wicked fled for feare of him, and all the workers of iniquitie were put to trouble: and saluation prospered in his hand.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 And hee grieued diuers Kings, but Iacob reioyced by his actes, and his memoriall is blessed for euer.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 He went also thorowe the cities of Iuda, and destroied the wicked out of them, and turned away the wrath from Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 So was hee renowmed vnto the endes of the earth, and hee assembled together those that were ready to perish.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 But Apollonius gathered the Gentiles, & a great host out of Samaria, to fight against Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 Which when Iudas perceiued, he went forth to meete him, and smote him, and slewe him, so that many fell downe slayne, and the rest fled.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 So Iudas tooke their spoyles, and tooke also Apollonius sworde, and fought with it all his life long.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 Nowe when Seron a prince of the armie of Syria, heard that Iudas had gathered vnto him the Congregation, and Church of the faithfull, and went forth to the warre,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 He sayd, I wil get me a name, and wil be glorious in the realme: for I will goe fight with Iudas, and them that are with him, which haue despised the kings commandement.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 So he made him ready to go vp, & there went with him a mightie hoste of the vngodly to helpe him, and to be auenged of the children of Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 And when he came neere to the

treasurie, and gaue his host a yeeres wages in hande, commanding them to be ready for a yeere for all occasions.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 Neuerthelesse, when he sawe that the money of his treasures failed, and that the tributes in the countrey were small, because of the dissention, and plagues that he had brought vpon the lande, in taking away the lawes which had bene of olde time,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 He feared least he shoulde not haue nowe at the seconde time, as the first, for the charges and gifts that he had giuen with a liberall hande afore: for in liberalitie he farre passed the other kings that were before him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 Wherefore he was heauie in his minde, and thought to goe into Persia, for to take tributes of the countreys, and to gather much money.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 So he left Lysias a noble man & of the kings blood to ouersee the

the kings friends,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>{\cf2 And sent with them fourty thousand footemen, and seuen thousand horsemen, to go into the lande of Iuda, and to destroy it, as the king commanded.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>{\cf2 So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitched by Emmaus in the plaine countrey.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>{\cf2 Nowe when the marchants of the countrey heard the rumour of them, they tooke very much siluer and golde, and seruantes, and came into the campe to buy the children of Israel for slaues, and the strength of Syria and of strange nations ioyned with them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>{\cf2 Nowe when Iudas and his brethren sawe that trouble increased, and that the hoste drewe neere vnto their borders, considering the kinges words, whereby he had commanded to destroy the people, and vtterly abolish them,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>{\cf2 They said one to another, Let vs redresse the decay of our people, and let vs fight for our people, and for our Sanctuarie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>{\cf2 Then the Congregation were soone readie gathered to fight, and to pray, and to desire mercie and compassion.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>{\cf2 As for Ierusalem, it was not inhabited, but was as a wildernesse. There went none that was borne in it, in or out at it, and the Sanctuarie was troden downe, and the strangers kept the fortresse, and it was the habitation of the heathen: and the mirth of Iacob was taken away: the pipe and the harpe ceased.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>{\cf2 So they gathered them selues together, and came to Maspha before Ierusalem: for in Maspha was the place where they praied aforetime in Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>{\cf2 And they fasted that day, and put sackcloth vpon them, and cast ashes vpon their heads, & rent their clothes,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>{\cf2 And opened the booke of the lawe, wherein the heathen sought to paynt the likenes of their idoles,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>{\cf2 And brought the Priestes garments, and the first fruites, and the tithes, and set there the Nazarites, which accomplished their dayes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>{\cf2 And they cried with a loude voyce towarde heauen, saying, What shall wee doe with these? and whither shall we cary them away?}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>{\cf2 For thy Sanctuarie is troden downe and defiled, and thy Priestes are in heauinesse, and brought downe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>{\cf2 And beholde, the heathen are come against vs, to destroy vs: thou knowest what thinges they imagine against vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>{\cf2 How can we stand before them, except thou helpe vs?}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>{\cf2 Then they blewe the trumpets, and cryed with a loude voyce.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>{\cf2 And after this Iudas ordeyned captaines ouer the people, euen captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer hundreths, and captaines ouer fifties, and captaines ouer tenne.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>{\cf2 And they commaunded them that buylded houses, or married wiues, or planted vineyardes, or were fearefull, that they shoulde returne euery one to his owne house, according to the Lawe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>{\cf2 So the hoste remoued, and pitched vpon the Southside of Emmaus:}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>{\cf2 And Iudas sayde, Arme your selues, and be valiant men, and be ready against the morning to fight with these nations, which are gathered together against vs, to destroy vs and our Sanctuarie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>{\cf2 For it is better for vs to dye in battell, the to see the calamities of our people & of our Sactuary.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>{\cf2 Neuerthelesse as the will of God is in heauen, so be it.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
