<span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>{\cf2 For in his time they prospered well by him, so that the heathen were taken out of their countrey, and they also which were in the citie of Dauid at Ierusalem, where they had made them a castell, out of the which they went, and defiled all things that were about the Sanctuarie, & did great hurt vnto religion.}</span> <span class="verse"><a

<span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>{\cf2 And if any did contrary to these thinges or brake any of them, he should be punished.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>{\cf2 So it pleased all the people to agree that it shoulde bee done to Simon according vnto these wordes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>{\cf2 Simon also accepted it, and was content to be the high Priest, and the captaine, and the Prince of the Iewes, and of the Priestes, and to be the chiefe of all.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>{\cf2 And they commanded to set vp this writing in tables of brasse, and to fasten it to the wall that compassed the Sanctuarie in an open place,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>{\cf2 And that a copie of the same should be laide vp in the treasurie, that Simon and his sonnes might haue it.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
