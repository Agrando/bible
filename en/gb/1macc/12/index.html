take Ionathan, and to kill him: so hee departed, and came vnto Bethsan.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>{\cf2 Then went Ionathan foorth against him to the battell with fourtie thousande

name="46">46</a>{\cf2 Ionathan beleeued him, and did as hee saide, and sent away his hoste, which went into the lande of Iuda,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>{\cf2 And reteined but three thousande with him, whereof he sent two thousand into Galile, and one thousand went with himselfe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>{\cf2 Nowe assoone as Ionathan entred into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates, and tooke him, and slew all them with the sword, that came in with him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>{\cf2 Then sent Tryphon an hoste of footemen, and horsemen into Galile, and into the great plaine, to destroy all Ionathans companie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>{\cf2 But when they knewe that Ionathan was taken, and slaine, and those that were with him, they incouraged one another, and came foorth against them readie to the battell.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>{\cf2 But when they which followed vpon them, sawe that it was a matter of life, they turned backe againe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>{\cf2 By this meanes all they came into the land of Iuda peaceably, and bewailed Ionathan, and them that were with him, and feared greatly, and all Israel made great lamentation.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>{\cf2 For all the heathen that were rounde about them, sought to destroy them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>{\cf2 For they said, Now haue they no captaine, nor any man to helpe them: therefore let vs now fight against them, and roote out their memorie from among men.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
