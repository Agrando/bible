remember the euils that I haue done at Ierusalem: for I tooke all the vessels of golde and of siluer that were in it, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Iuda without cause.}</span> <span

the hundreth, and fourtie and ninth yere.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 When Lysias knewe, that the king was dead, he ordeined Antiochus his sonne (whome hee had brought vp) to reigne in his fathers steade, and called him Eupator.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 Now they that were in the castell at Ierusalem, kept in the Israelites round about the Sanctuarie, and sought alwayes their hurt, and the strengthening of the heathen.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 Therefore Iudas thought to destroy them, and called all the people together to besiege them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 So they came together and besieged them in the hundreth and fifty yeere, and made instruments to shoote and other engins of warre.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 But certaine of the that were besieged, gat foorth, (vnto whome some vngodly men of Israel ioyned themselues)}</span> <span

it, and haue fortified the Sanctuarie, and Beth-sura.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>{\cf2 And if thou doest not preuent them quickely, they will doe greater things then these, & thou shalt not be able to ouercome them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 When the King heard this, hee was very angrie, and called all his friendes, the captaines of his armie, and his horsemen,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 And bandes that were hired, came vnto him from the Kinges, that were confederate, and from the yles of the sea.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 So the number of his armie was an hundreth thousande footemen, and twentie thousand horsemen, and two and thirtie elephantes excercised in battel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 These came through Idumea and drew neere to Beth-sura, and besieged it a log season, and made engins of warre: but they came out, and burnt them with fire, and fought valiantly.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 Then departed Iudas from the castel, and remoued ye host toward Beth-zacarias ouer against the kings campe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>{\cf2 So the King arose very earely, and brought the army & his power toward the way of Beth-zacarias, where the army set themselues in aray to the battel, and blewe the trumpets.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>{\cf2 And to prouoke the elephants for to fight, they shewed the the bloud of grapes & mulberies,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>{\cf2 And they set the beastes according to the ranges: so that by euery elephant there stoode a thousand men armed with coates of maile and helmets of brasse vpon their heades, and vnto euery beast were ordeined fiue hudreth horseme of ye best,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>{\cf2 Which were readie at all times wheresoeuer the beast was: and whethersoeuer the beast went, they went also, and departed not from him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>{\cf2 And vpon them were strog towers of wood that couered euery beast, which were fastened thereon with instruments, and vpon euery one was twoand thirtie men that fought in them, and the Indian that ruled him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>{\cf2 They set also the remnant of the horsemen vpon both the sides in two wings of the hoste, to stirre them vp, and to keepe them in the valleyes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>{\cf2 And when the sunne shone vpon the golden shieldes, the mountaines glistered therewith, and gaue light as lampes of fire.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>{\cf2 Thus parte of the Kings armie was spred vpon the high mountaines, and part beneath: so they marched forward warily and in order.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>{\cf2 And all they that heard the noyse of their multitude, and the marching of the companie, and the ratling of the harnesse, were astonished: for the armie was very great and mightie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>{\cf2 Then Iudas and his hoste entred into the battell, and they slewe sixe hundreth men of the Kings armie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>{\cf2 Now when Eleazar, the sonne of Abaron, saw one of the elephants armed with royall harnes, and was more excellent then all the other beastes, he thought that the King should be vpon him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>{\cf2 Wherefore he ieoparded him selfe to deliuer his people, and to get him a perpetuall name,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>{\cf2 And ran boldly vnto him through the mids of the hoste, slaying on the right hand, and on the left, so that they departed away on both sides.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>{\cf2 So went he to the elephants feete, and gate him vnder him, and slewe him: then fell the elephant downe vpon him, and there he dyed.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>{\cf2 But the other, seeing the power of the king & the fiercenesse of his armie, departed from them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>{\cf2 And the Kings armie went vp to meete them towarde Ierusalem, and the King pitched his tents in Iudea towarde mount Sion.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>{\cf2 Moreouer, the King tooke truce with them that were in Beth-sura: but when they came out of the citie, because they had no vitailes there, and were shut vp therein, and the lande had rested,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>{\cf2 The King tooke Beth-sura, and set there a garison to keepe it,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>{\cf2 And besieged the Sanctuarie many dayes, and made instruments to shoote, and other engins of warre, and instruments to cast fire and stones, & pieces to cast dartes and slings.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>{\cf2 They also made engines against their engines, and fought a long season.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>{\cf2 But in the garners there were no vitailes: for it was the seuenth yeere, and then they that were in Iudea, and were deliuered from the Gentiles, had eaten vp the residue of the store,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>{\cf2 So that in the Sanctuarie were few men left: for the famine came so vpon them, that they were scattered euery man to his owne place.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>{\cf2 Nowe when Lysias heard that Philippe (whome Antiochus the King, whiles he liued, had ordeyned to bring vp Antiochus his sonne, that he might be King)}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>{\cf2 Was come againe out of Persia and Media, and the Kings hoste with him, and thought to take vnto him the rule of things,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>{\cf2 He and his hasted, and were stirred forwarde by them in the castle to go and tell the King, and the captaines of the hoste, and to others, saying, We decrease daily, and our vitailes are but small: & the place that we lay siege vnto, is strong, and the affaires of the realme depende vpon vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>{\cf2 Now therefore let vs agree with these men, and take truce with them, and with al their nation,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>{\cf2 And graunt them to liue after their Lawe, as they did afore: for they be grieued, and doe all these things, because we haue broken their Lawes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>{\cf2 So the King and the princes were content, and sent vnto them to make peace, and they receiued it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>{\cf2 When the King and the princes had made an othe vnto them, they came vpon this out of the fortresse.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>{\cf2 And the King went vp to mount Sion: but when he sawe that the place was well defensed, he brake his othe that he had made, and commanded to breake downe the wall round about.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>{\cf2 Then departed he in all haste, and returned vnto Antiochia, where he found Philip hauing dominion of the citie: so he fought against him, and tooke the citie by force.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
