the remnant fled.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 So Ionathan and Simon tooke Iudas their brother, and buryed him in his fathers sepulchre in the citie of Modin.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 And al the Israelites wept for him, & mourned greatly for him, & lameted many dayes, saying,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 How is the

came so great trouble in Israel, as was not since the time that no Prophet was seene among them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 Then came all Iudas friendes together, and saide vnto Ionathan,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 Seeing thy brother Iudas is dead, and there is none like him to goe forth against our enemies, euen against Bacchides, and against

our battell.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 So Ionathan tooke the gouernance vpon him at the same time, and ruled in stead of his brother Iudas.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 But when Bacchides knewe it, he sought for to slay him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>{\cf2 Then Ionathan and Simon his brother, perceiuing that, fled into the wildernes of Thecua with all their companie, and pitched their tents by the water poole of Asphar.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>{\cf2 Which when Bacchides vnderstoode, hee came ouer Iorden with all his hoste vpon the Sabbath day.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>{\cf2 (Nowe had Ionathan sent his brother Iohn, a captaine of the people, to pray his friendes the Nabathites, that they would keepe their baggage which was much.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>{\cf2 But the children of Ambri came out of Medaba, and tooke Iohn, and al that he had, and when they had taken it, went their way.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>{\cf2 After this came worde vnto Ionathan, and to Simon his brother, that the children of Ambri made a great marriage, and brought the bride from Medaba with great pompe: for she was daughter to one of the noblest Princes of Canaan.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>{\cf2 Therefore they remembred Iohn their brother, and went vp, and hid themselues vnder the couert of the mountaine.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>{\cf2 So they lift vp their eyes, and looked, and beholde, there was a great noyse, and much preparation: then the bridegrome came forth, and his friends and his brethre met them with tymbrels, & instruments of musike, and many weapons.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>{\cf2 The Ionathans men that lay in ambush, rose vp against them, and slewe many of them, and the remnant fledde into the mountaines, so that they tooke all their spoyles.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>{\cf2 Thus the marriage was turned to mourning, and the noyse of their melodie into lamentation.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>{\cf2 And so when they had auenged the blood of their brother, they turned againe vnto Iorden.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>{\cf2 When Bacchides heard this, hee came vnto the border of Iorden with a great power vpon the Sabbath day.)}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>{\cf2 Then Ionathan saide vnto his companie, Let vs rise nowe, and fight against our enemies: for it is not to day as in time past.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>{\cf2 Beholde, the battel is before vs, and behinde vs, and the water of Iorden on this side and that side, and the marise, and forest, so that there is no place for vs to turne aside.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>{\cf2 Wherefore crie nowe vnto heauen, that yee may be deliuered from the power of your enemies: so they ioyned battell.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>{\cf2 Then Ionathan stretched out his hande to smite Bacchides: but hee turned aside from him & reculed.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>{\cf2 Then Ionathan, & they that were with him, leapt into Iorden, and swimmed ouer vnto the further banke: but the other would not passe through Iorden after them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>{\cf2 So in that day were slaine of Bacchides side about a thousand men.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>{\cf2 Then hee turned againe to Ierusalem, and buylt vp the strong cities in Iuda, as the castell of Iericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, & Tepho, with high walles, with gates, and with barres,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>{\cf2 And set Garisons in them, that they might vse their malice vpon Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>{\cf2 He fortified also the citie Beth-sura, and Gazara, and the castel, and set a garison in them with prouision of vitailes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>{\cf2 Hee tooke also the chiefest mens sonnes in the countrey for hostages, and put them in the castell at Ierusalem to be kept.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>{\cf2 Afterward in the hundreth, fiftie & three yere, in the second moneth, Alcimus commaunded, that the walles of the inner court of the Sanctuary should be destroyed, & he pulled downe the monuments of ye Prophetes, & began to destroy them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>{\cf2 But at the same time Alcimus was plagued, and his enterprises were hindered, and his mouth was stopped: for he was smitten with a palsie, and could no more speake, nor giue order concerning his house.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>{\cf2 Thus dyed Alcimus with great torment at the same time.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>{\cf2 And when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he turned againe to the King, and so the land of Iuda was in rest two yeeres.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>{\cf2 Then all the vngodly men helde a counsell, saying, Behold, Ionathan and his companie dwell at ease, and without care: wherefore let vs bring Bacchides hither, and he wil take them all in one night.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>{\cf2 So they went and consulted with him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>{\cf2 Who arose and came with a great hoste, and sent letters priuily to his adherents, which were in Iudea, to take Ionathan and those that were with him: but they coulde not, for their counsell was knowen vnto them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>{\cf2 And they tooke fiftie men of the countrey, which were the chiefe workers of this wickednesse, and slewe them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>{\cf2 Then Ionathan and Simon with their companie departed vnto Beth-basin which is in the wildernes, and repaired the decay thereof, and made it strong.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>{\cf2 When Bacchides knewe this, he gathered all his hoste, & sent word to them that were of Iudea.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>{\cf2 Then came he and layd siege to Beth-basin, and fought against it a long season, and made instruments of warre.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>{\cf2 But Ionathan had left his brother Simon in the citie, and went foorth into the countrey, and came with a certaine nomber,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>{\cf2 And slewe Odomeras and his brethren and the children of Phasiron in their tentes: so hee began to slay, and increased in power.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>{\cf2 Simon also and his companie went out of the citie, and burnt vp the instruments of warre,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>{\cf2 And fought against Bacchides, and discomfited him, and vexed him sore, so that his counsell and iourney was in vaine.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>{\cf2 Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men, that gaue him counsel to come into the countrey, and slewe many of them, and purposed to returne into his owne countrey.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>{\cf2 Whereof when Ionathan had knowledge, he sent Ambassadours vnto him, to intreate of peace with him, & that the prisoners should be deliuered.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>{\cf2 Which thing he accepted, and did according to his desire, and made an othe, that he would neuer doe him harme all the dayes of his life.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>{\cf2 So he restored vnto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the land of Iuda, and so returned and went into his owne lande, neither did he come any more into their borders.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>{\cf2 Thus the sworde ceased from Israel, and Ionathan dwelt at Machmas, and began there to gouerne the people, and destroyed the vngodly men out of Israel.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
