Simon heard that Tryphon gathered a great hoste to come into the land of Iuda, to destroy it,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 And sawe that the people was in great trembling and feare, he came vp to Ierusalem, and gathered the people together,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 And gaue them exhortation, saying, Ye know what great thinges I, and my brethren, and my fathers house haue done for the Lawe, & the Sanctuarie, and the battels, & troubles that we haue seene.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 By reason whereof all my brethren are slaine for Israels sake, and I am left alone.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 Nowe therefore God forbid, that I shoulde spare mine owne life in any time of trouble: for I am not better then my brethren.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 But I wil auenge my nation, and the Sanctuarie, and our wiues, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered together to destroye vs of very malice.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 In hearing these words the hearts of the people were kindled,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 So that they cried with a lowd voyce, saying, Thou shalt be our captaine in steade of Iudas and Ionathan thy brethren.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 Fight thou our battels, and whatsoeuer thou commaundest vs, we will doe it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 So hee gathered all the men of warre, making hast to finish the walles of Ierusalem, and fortified it round about.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 Then sent he Ionathan the sonne of Absalomus with a great host vnto Ioppe, which droue them out that were therein, and remained there himselfe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 Tryphon also remoued from Ptolemais with a great armie, to come into the land of Iuda, and Ionathan was with him as prisoner.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 And Simon pitched his tents at Addidis vpon the open plaine.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 But when Tryphon knew that Simon stoode vp in steade of his brother Ionathan, and that hee woulde fight against him, hee sent messengers vnto him, saying,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 Whereas we haue kept Ionathan thy brother, it is for money that hee is owing in the Kings account concerning the busines that he had in hand.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 Wherefore send now an hundreth talents of siluer, and his two sonnes for hostages, that when he is letten foorth, hee will not turne from vs, andwe will send him againe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 Neuertheles Simon knew that he dissembled in his wordes, yet commaunded he the money and children to be deliuered vnto him, least he should be in greater hatred of the people of Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 Who might haue sayd, Because he sent him not the money and the children, therefore is Ionathan dead.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 So he sent the children and an hundreth talents: but he dissembled, and would not let Ionathan goe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 Afterward came Tryphon into the land to destroy it, and went round about by the way, that leadeth vnto Adora: but wheresoeuer they went, thither went Simon and his hoste.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 Now they that were in the castell, sent messengers vnto Tryphon, that hee should make haste to come by the wildernes, & to send them vittailes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>{\cf2 So Tryphon made ready all his horsemen: but the same night fell a very great snowe, so that he came not, because of the snowe: but he remoued and went into the countrey of Galaad.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 And when hee came neere to Bascama, he slewe Ionathan, and he was buried there.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>{\cf2 So Tryphon returned, and went into his owne land.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>{\cf2 Then sent Simon to take the bones of Ionathan his brother, and they buried him in Modin his fathers citie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>{\cf2 And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and mourned for him very long.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>{\cf2 And Simon made vpon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, a building hie to looke vnto, of hewen stone behinde and before,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 And set vp seuen pillars vpon it, one against another, for his father, his mother, and foure brethren,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 And set great pillars round about them, and set armes vpon the pillars for a perpetuall memorie, and carued ships beside the armes, that they might be seene of men sayling in the sea.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 This sepulchre which hee made at Modin, standeth yet vnto this day.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 Nowe as Tryphon went foorth with the yong King Antiochus, he slew him traiterously,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 And reigned in his steade, and crowned him selfe King of Asia, and brought a great plague vpon the land.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>{\cf2 Simon also built vp the castels of Iudea, and compassed them about with hie towers, and great walles, euen with towers, and gates, and barres, and layde vp vittailes in the strong holdes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>{\cf2 Moreouer Simon chose certaine men & sent them to king Demetrius, that he would discharge the land: for all Tryphons doings were robberies.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>{\cf2 Whereupon Demetrius the king answered him, and wrote vnto him after this maner,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>{\cf2 Demetrivs the King vnto Simon the hie Priest, and the friend of Kings, & to the Elders and to the nation of the Iewes sendeth greeting.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>{\cf2 The golden crowne, and precious stone that ye sent vnto vs, haue we receiued, and are ready to make a stedfast peace with you, and to write vnto the officers, to release you of the things wherein we made you free.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>{\cf2 So the things that we haue graunted you, shall be stable: the strong holdes which ye haue builded, shalbe your owne.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>{\cf2 Also we forgiue the ouersights, and faultes committed vnto this day, and the crowne taxe that ye ought vs: and whereas was any other tribute in Ierusalem, it shalbe nowe no tribute.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>{\cf2 And they that are meete among you to be written with our men, let them be written vp, that there may be peace betweene vs.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>{\cf2 Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken from Israel in the hundred and seuentie yeere.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>{\cf2 And the people of Israel began to write in their letters, and publique instruments, In The First yeere of Simon, the hie and chiefe Priest, gouernour and prince of the Iewes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>{\cf2 In those dayes Simon camped against Gaza, and besieged it round about, where he set vp an engine of warre, and approched neere the citie, and beat a tower, and tooke it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>{\cf2 So they that were in the engine, leapt into the citie, and there was great trouble in the citie,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>{\cf2 In so much that the people of the citie rent their clothes, and climed vp vpon the walles with their wiues, & children, & cried with a loud voyce, beseeching Simon to graunt them peace, saying,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>{\cf2 Deale not with vs according to our wickednes, but according to thy mercy.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>{\cf2 Then Simon pitied them, and would fight no more against them, but put them out of the citie, and clensed the houses, wherein the idoles were, and so entred thereunto with psalmes and thankesgiuing.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>{\cf2 So when he had cast all the filthines out, he set such men in it as kept the Law, and fortified it, and builded there a dwelling place for him selfe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>{\cf2 Nowe, when they in the castell at Ierusalem were kept, that they could not come foorth nor goe into the countrey, neither buy nor sell, they were very hungry, & many of them were famished to death,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>{\cf2 In so much that they besought Simon to make peace with them: which he graunted them, and put them out from thence, and clensed the castell from filthines.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>{\cf2 And vpon the three and twentie day of the second moneth, in the hundreth seuentie and one yeere, they entred into it with thankesgiuing, and branches of palme trees, and with harpes, and with cymbales, and with violes, & with psalmes, & songs, because the great enemie of Israel was ouercome.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>{\cf2 And he ordeined that the same day should be kept euery yeere with gladnes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>{\cf2 And he fortified the mount of the Temple that was beside the castell where he dwelt himselfe with his company.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>{\cf2 Simon also seeing that Iohn his sonne was now a man, he made him captaine of all the hostes, and caused him to dwell in Gazaris.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
