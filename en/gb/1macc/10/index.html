vnto Ptolemais in the hundreth threescore and two yeere,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>{\cf2 Where King Alexander met him, and he gaue vnto him his daughter Cleopatra, and marryed them at Ptolemais with great glorie, as the maner of Kings is.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>{\cf2 Then wrote King Alexander vnto Ionathan, that he should come and meete him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>{\cf2 So he went honourably vnto Ptolemais, and there hee met the two Kings, and gaue them great presents of siluer and golde, and to their friends, and found

them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>{\cf2 And the King commanded that they should take off the garments of Ionathan, and clothe him in purple: and so they did: and the King appointed him to sit by him,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>{\cf2 And saide vnto his Princes, Goe with him into the middes of the citie, and make a proclamation, that no man complaine against

name="67">67</a>{\cf2 In the hundreth, threescore and fiue yeere came Demetrius the sonne of Demetrius, from Creta into his fathers land.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>{\cf2 Whereof when King Alexander heard, hee was very sorie, and returned vnto Antiochia.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>{\cf2 Then Demetrius appointed Apollonius thegouernour of Coelosyria, who gathered a great hoste, and camped in Iamnia, and sent vnto Ionathan the hie Priest, saying,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>{\cf2 Darest thou, being but alone, lift vp thy selfe

then if thou trust in thine owne strength, come downe to vs into the plaine fielde, and there let vs trie the matter together: for I haue the strength of cities.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>{\cf2 Aske and learne who I am, and they shall take my part: and they shall tell thee that your foote is not able to stand before our face: for thy fathers haue bene twise chased in their owne land.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>{\cf2 And now how wilt thou be able to abide so great an hoste of horsemen and footemen in the plaine, where is neither stone, nor rocke, nor place to flee vnto?}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>{\cf2 When Ionathan heard the wordes of Apollonius, he was moued in his minde: wherefore hee chose ten thousand men, & went out of Ierusalem, and Simon his brother met him for to helpe him.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>{\cf2 And he pitched his tentes at Ioppe: but they shut him out of the citie: for Apollonius garison was in Ioppe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>{\cf2 Then they fought against it, and they that were in the citie, for very feare let him in: so Ionathan wanne Ioppe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>{\cf2 Apollonius hearing of this, tooke three thousand horsemen with a great hoste of foote men, and went toward Azotus, as though he would go forward, and came immediatly into the plaine fielde, because he had so many horsemen, and put his trust in them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>{\cf2 So Ionathan followed vpon him to Azotus, and the armie skirmished with his arriere band.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>{\cf2 For Apollonius had left a thousand horsmen behinde them in ambush.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>{\cf2 And Ionathan knew that there was an ambushment behinde him, and though they had compassed in his hoste, and shot dartes at the people from the morning to the euening,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="81">81</a>{\cf2 Yet the people stood still, as Ionathan had commanded them, till their horses were wearie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="82">82</a>{\cf2 Then brought Simon foorth his hoste, and set them against the band: but the horses were weary, and he discomfited them, and they fled: so the horsemen were scattered in the fielde,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="83">83</a>{\cf2 And they fled to Azotus, and came into the temple of Dagon their idole, that they might there saue them selues.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="84">84</a>{\cf2 But Ionathan set fire vpon Azotus and all the cities round about it, and tooke their spoyles, and burnt with fire the temple of Dagon with all them that were fled into it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="85">85</a>{\cf2 Thus were slaine and burnt about eight thousand men.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="86">86</a>{\cf2 So Ionathan remooued the
