And I set a great  assembly against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be  sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing [to answer].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also I said, It [is] not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the  reproach of the heathen our enemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For euen I, my brethren, and my seruants doe lende them money and corne: I pray you, let vs leaue off this burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil,  that ye exact of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said they, We will restore it, and will not require it of them: we will doe as thou hast said. Then I called the Priestes, and caused them to sweare, that they shoulde doe according to this promes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So I shooke my lappe, and said, So let God shake out euery man that wil not perfourme this promise from his house, & from his labour: euen thus let him be shaken out, & emptied; all the Cogregation said, Amen, & praised the Lord: and the people did according to this promes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the  bread of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the former gouernours that were before me, had bene chargeable vnto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides fourtie shekels of siluer: yea, and their seruants bare rule ouer the people: but so did not I, because of the feare of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But rather I fortified a portio in the worke of this wall, and we bought no lande, and all my seruants came thither together vnto the worke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreouer there were at my table an hundreth & fiftie of the Iewes, & rulers, which came vnto vs from among the heathen that are about vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now [that] which was prepared [for me] daily [was] one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of  all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Remember me, O my God, in goodnesse, according to all that I haue done for this people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
