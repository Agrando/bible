Now I had not been [beforetime] sad in his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the king said vnto me, Why is thy coutenance sad, seeing thou art not sicke? this is nothing, but sorow of heart. Then was I sore afrayd,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I said to the King, God saue the King for euer: why should not my countenance be sad, when the citie & house of the sepulchres of my fathers lieth waste, and the gates thereof are deuoured with fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed  to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And sayde vnto the King, If it please the King, and if thy seruant haue found fauour in thy sight, I desire that thou wouldest send me to Iudah vnto the city of the sepulchres of my fathers, that I may buyld it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the King sayd vnto me, (the Queene also sitting by him) How long shall thy iourney be? & when wilt thou come againe? So it pleased the King, and he sent me, and I set him a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After I saide vnto the King, If it please the King, let them giue mee letters to the captaines beyond the Riuer, that they may conuay me ouer, till I come into Iudah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [appertained] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to  the good hand of my God upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then came I to the captaines beyonde the Riuer, and gaue them the Kings letters; the King had sent captaines of the armie and horsemen with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When  Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I came to Ierusalem, & was there three dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I rose in the night, I, and a fewe men with me: for I told no man, what God had put in mine heart to do at Ierusalem, & there was not a beast with me, saue the beast whereon I rode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, & came before the draggon well, and to the dung porte, and vewed the walles of Ierusalem, howe they were broken downe, and the portes thereof deuoured with the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I went foorth vnto the gate of the fountaine, and to the Kings fishpoole, and there was no rowme for the beast that was vnder me to passe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then went I vp in ye night by the brooke, and viewed the wall, and turned backe, and comming backe, I entred by the gate of the valley & returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the rulers knewe not whither I was gone, nor what I did, neither did I as yet tell it vnto the Iewes, nor to the Priestes, nor to the noble men, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that laboured in the worke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we [are] in, how Jerusalem [lieth] waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more  a reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they  strengthened their hands for [this] good [work].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and  Geshem the Arabian, heard [it], they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What [is] this thing that ye do? will ye  rebel against the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor  memorial, in Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
