will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and said, Although they buylde, yet if a foxe goe vp, he shall euen breake downe their stonie wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey  in the land of captivity:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And cover not their  iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So we built the wall, and all the wall was ioyned vnto the halfe thereof, and the heart of the people was to worke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when Sanballat, & Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodims heard that the walles of Ierusalem were repayred, (for the breaches began to be stopped) then they were very wroth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And conspired all together to come & to fight against Ierusalem, and to hinder them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The we prayed vnto our God, & set watchmen by them, day and night, because of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Iudah said, The strength of the bearers is weakened, and there is much earth, so that we are not able to build the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Also our aduersaries had sayde, They shall not knowe, neither see, till we come into the middes of them and slay them, and cause the worke to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us  ten times,  From all places whence ye shall return unto us [they will be upon you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall vpon the toppes of the stones, & placed the people by their families, with their swordes, their speares and their bowes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them:  remember the Lord, [which is] great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when our enemies heard that it was knowen vnto vs, then God brought their counsell to nought, and we turned all againe to the wall, euery one vnto his worke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass from that time forth, [that] the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers [were]  behind all the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They that buylded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, and they that laded, did the worke with one hand, and with the other helde the sworde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For euery one of the buylders had his sworde girded on his loynes, and so buylded: and he that blewe the trumpet, was beside me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then saide I vnto the Princes, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The worke is great and large, and we are separated vpon the wall, one farre from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In what place [therefore] ye hear the sound of the trumpet,  resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So we laboured in the worke, and halfe of them helde the speares, from the appearing of the morning, till the starres came foorth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And at the same time said I vnto the people, Let euery one with his seruant lodge within Ierusalem, that they may be a watch for vs in the night, and labour in the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, [saving that] every one put them off  for washing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
