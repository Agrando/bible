Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I sent vnto him, saying, It is not done according to these wordes that thou sayest: for thou feynest them of thine owne heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all they afrayed vs, saying, Their handes shalbe weakened from the worke, and it shall not be done: nowe therefore incourage thou me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who [was]  shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I said,  Should such a man as I flee? and who [is there], that, [being] as I [am], would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And loe, I perceiued, that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecie against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore was he hyred, that I might be afrayde, and doe thus, and sinne, and that they might haue an euill report that they might reproche me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the  prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month]  Elul, in  fifty and two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when all our enemies heard thereof, euen all the heathen that were about vs, they were afraid, & their courage failed them: for they knew, that this worke was wrought by our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many  letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For there were many in Iudah, that were sworne vnto him: for he was the sonne in lawe of Shechaniah, the sonne of Arah: and his sonne Iehonathan had the daughter of Meshullam, the sonne of Berechiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, they spake in his praise before me, & tolde him my wordes, and Tobiah sent letters to put me in feare.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
