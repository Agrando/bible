And I assembled them, and set them in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then brought all Iudah the tithes of corne and of wine, and of oyle vnto the treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I made treasurers ouer the treasures, Shelemiah the Priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Leuites, Pedaiah, and vnder their hande Hanan the sonne of Zaccur the sonne of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithfull, and their office was to distribute vnto their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my  good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days saw I in Judah [some] treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all [manner of] burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and  I testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There dwelt men of Tyrus also therein, which brought fish and all wares, and solde on the Sabbath vnto the children of Iudah euen in Ierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then reprooued I the rulers of Iudah, and sayd vnto them, What euil thing is this that yee doe, and breake the Sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Did not your fathers  thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be  dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and [some] of my servants set I at the gates, [that] there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the chapmen and marchants of al marchandise remained once or twise all night without Ierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I protested among them, and said vnto them, Why tary ye all night about the wall? If ye do it once againe, I will lay hands vpon you. from that time came they no more on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and [that] they should come [and]  keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, [concerning] this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In those days also saw I Jews [that] had married wives of  Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And their children spake halfe in ye speach of Ashdod, and could not speake in the Iewes language, and according to the language of the one people, and of the other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I contended with them, and  cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not Salomon the king of Israel sinne by these thinges? yet among many nations was there no King like him: for he was beloued of his God, and God had made him King ouer Israel: yet strange women caused him to sinne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shall wee then obey vnto you, to doe all this great euil, and to transgresse against our God, euen to marry strange wiues?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the sonnes of Ioiada the sonne of Eliashib the hie Priest was the sonne in law of Sanballat the Horonite: but I chased him fro me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Remember them, O my God, because they have  defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then cleansed I them from all strangers, and appoynted the wardes of the Priestes and of the Leuites, euery one in his office,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God,  for good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
