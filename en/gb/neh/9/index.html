and [another] fourth part they  confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then stoode vp vpon the staires of the Leuites Ieshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cryed with a loud voyce vnto the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Leuites said, euen Ieshua and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodiiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah, Stande vp, and praise the Lorde your God for euer, and euer, and let them praise thy glorious Name, O God, which excelleth aboue all thankesgiuing and praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou art Lorde alone: thou hast made heauen, and the heauen of all heauens, with all their hoste, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, & al that are in them, & thou preseruest them all, and the host of the heauen worshippeth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou art, O Lord, the God, that hast chosen Abram, and broughtest him out of Vr in Caldea, and madest his name Abraham,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a couenant with him, to giue vnto his seede the lande of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, and Perizzites, and Iebusites, and Girgashites, and hast performed thy wordes, because thou art iust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou hast also considered the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the red Sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And shewed tokens & wonders vpon Pharaoh, and on all his seruants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudely against them: therefore thou madest thee a Name, as appeareth this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thou didest breake vp the Sea before them, and they went through the middes of the Sea on dry lande: and those that pursued them, hast thou cast into the bottomes as a stone, in the mightie waters:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And leddest them in the day with a pillar of a cloude, and in the night with a pillar of fire to giue them light in the way that they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou camest downe also vpon mount Sinai, and spakest vnto them from heauen, and gauest them right iudgements, and true lawes, ordinances and good commandements,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And declaredst vnto them thine holy Sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, and ordinances, and lawes, by the hande of Moses thy seruant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And gauest them bread from heauen for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rocke for their thirst: and promisedst them that they shoulde goe in, and take possession of the land: for the which thou haddest lift vp thine hand for to giue them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they and our fathers behaued them selues proudely, and hardened their neck, so that they hearkened not vnto thy commandements,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But refused to obey, & would not remember thy marueilous works that thou haddest done for them, but hardened their neckes, and had in their heads to returne to their bondage by their rebellion: but thou, O God of mercies, gratious and full of compassion, of long suffring and of great mercie, yet forsookest them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreouer, when they made them a molten calfe (and said, This is thy God that brought thee vp out of the land of Egypt) and committed great blasphemies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet thou for thy great mercies forsookest them not in the wildernesse: the pillar of the cloude departed not from them by day to leade them the way, neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way whereby they should goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou gauest also thy good Spirite to instruct them, & withheldest not thy MAN from their mouth, & gauest them water for their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, [so that] they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet  swelled not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst  divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou diddest multiplie their children, like the starres of the heauen, and broughtest them into the lande, whereof thou haddest spoken vnto their fathers, that they should goe, and possesse it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the children went in, and possessed the lande, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the lande, euen the Canaanites, and gauest them into their handes, with their Kings and the people of the lande, that they might do with them what they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they tooke their strong cities and the fat lande, and possessed houses, full of all goods, cisternes digged out, vineyardes, and oliues, and trees for foode in abundance, and they did eate, and were filled, and became fat, and liued in pleasure through thy great goodnesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which  testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore thou deliueredst them into the hande of their enemies that vexed them: yet in the time of their affliction, when they cryed vnto thee, thou heardest them from the heauen, & through thy great mercies thou gauest them sauiours, who saued them out of the hande of their aduersaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after they had  rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest [them] from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and  withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not  hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yet thou diddest forbeare them many yeeres, and protestedst among them by thy Spirite, euen by the hande of thy Prophets, but they woulde not heare: therefore gauest thou them into the hande of the people of the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet for thy great mercies thou hast not consumed them, neither forsaken them: for thou art a gracious and mercifull God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the  kings of Assyria unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Howbeit thou [art] just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast  done right, but we have done wickedly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst  testify against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they haue not serued thee in their kingdome, and in thy great goodnesse that thou shewedst vnto them, & in the large and fat lande which thou diddest set before them, and haue not conuerted from their euill workes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Behold, we [are] servants this day, and [for] the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the  fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we [are] servants in it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it yeeldeth much fruit vnto the kings whom thou hast set ouer vs, because of our sinnes: and they haue dominion ouer our bodyes and ouer our cattell at their pleasure, and we are in great affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And because of all this we make  a sure [covenant], and write [it]; and our princes, Levites, [and] priests, seal [unto it].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
