God knoweth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they  glory, they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of  light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it is no great thing, though his ministers transforme themselues, as though they were the ministers of righteousnes, whose end shall be according to their workes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That I speake, I speake it not after the Lord: but as it were foolishly, in this my great boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that many reioyce after the flesh, I will reioyce also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For ye suffer fooles gladly, because that yee are wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour [you], if a man take [of you], if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak as concerning  reproach, as though we had been  weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They are Hebrues, so am I: they are Israelites, so am I: they are the seede of Abraham, so am I:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am]  more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in  deaths oft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Of the Jews  five times received I forty [stripes] save one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In iourneying I was often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of mine owne nation, in perils among the Gentiles, in perils in the citie, in perils in wildernes, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In weariness and  painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burne not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God, euen the Father of our Lorde Iesus Christ, which is blessed for euermore, knoweth that I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the gouernour of the people vnder King Aretas, layde watch in the citie of the Damascens, and would haue caught me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But at a windowe was I let downe in a basket through the wall, and escaped his handes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
