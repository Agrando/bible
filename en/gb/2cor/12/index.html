I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I knew a man  in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the  third heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I knowe such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I can not tell: God knoweth)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>How that he was caught up into  paradise, and heard  unspeakable words, which it is not  lawful for a man to utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For though I woulde reioyce, I should not be a foole, for I will say the trueth: but I refraine, lest any man should thinke of me aboue that hee seeth in me, or that he heareth of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me  a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of  Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this thing I besought the Lord  thrice, that it might depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.  Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may  rest upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I take  pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me:  for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the  signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except [it be] that I myself was not  burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the thirde time I am ready to come vnto you, and yet will I not be slouthfull to your hinderance: for I seeke not yours, but you: for the children ought not to laye vp for the fathers, but the fathers for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will most gladly bestow, and will be bestowed for your soules: though the more I loue you, the lesse I am loued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I pill you by any of them whom I sent vnto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I haue desired Titus, and with him I haue sent a brother: did Titus pill you of any thing? walked we not in the selfe same spirit? walked we not in the same steppes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in  Christ: but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and [that] I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I feare least when I come againe, my God abase me among you, and I shall bewaile many of them which haue sinned already, and haue not repented of the vncleannesse, and fornication, and wantonnesse which they haue committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
