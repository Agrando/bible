If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of  himself think this again, that, as he [is] Christ's, even so [are] we Christ's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For though I shoulde boast somewhat more of our authoritie, which the Lorde hath giuen vs for edification, and not for your destruction, I should haue no shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This I say, that I may not seeme as it were to feare you with letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For [his] letters, say  they, [are] weighty and powerful; but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such one thinke this, that such as wee are in woorde by letters, when we are absent, such wil we be also in deede, when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we  dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by  themselves, and  comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not boast of things without [our]  measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we stretche not our selues beyonde our measure, as though wee had not attained vnto you: for euen to you also haue we come in preaching the Gospel of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Not boasting of things  without [our] measure, [that is], of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in  another man's line of things made ready to our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For hee that praiseth himselfe, is not alowed, but he whome the Lorde praiseth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
