Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are  called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If ye fulfil the  royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if yee regarde the persons, yee commit sinne, and are rebuked of the Lawe, as transgressours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of  all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no  mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And one of you say vnto them, Depart in peace: warme your selues, and fil your bellies, notwithstading ye giue them not those things which are needefull to the body, what helpeth it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Euen so the faith, if it haue no woorkes, is dead in it selfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea,  a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father  justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seest thou how faith  wrought with his works, and by works was faith made  perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scripture was  fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye see then how that by works a man is  justified, and not by  faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
