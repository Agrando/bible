Ye haue heaped vp treasure for the last dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the  ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have  nourished your hearts, as in a  day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ye haue condemned and haue killed the iust, and he hath not resisted you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.  Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be ye also patient therefore and settle your hearts: for ye comming of the Lord draweth nere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:  behold, the judge standeth before the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the  end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let  your yea be yea; and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with  oil in the  name of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed  sins, they shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.
