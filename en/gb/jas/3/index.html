If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the shippes, which though they be so great, and are driuen of fierce windes, yet are they turned about with a very small rudder, whither soeuer the gouernour listeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.  Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue [is] a fire, a  world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and  setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the whole nature of beasts, & of birds, and of creeping things, and things of the sea is tamed, and hath bene tamed of the nature of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the tongue can no man tame. It is an vnruly euill, full of deadly poyson.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the  similitude of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Doeth a fountaine send forth at one place sweete water and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can ye figge tree, my brethren, bring forth oliues, either a vine figges? so can no fountaine make both salt water and sweete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye haue bitter enuying and strife in your hearts, reioyce not, neither be liars against the trueth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisedome descendeth not from aboue, but is earthly, sensuall, and deuilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where enuying and strife is, there is sedition, and all maner of euill workes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of  mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
