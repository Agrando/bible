And they went about, and laied wayte for him all night in the gate of the citie, & were quiet all the nyght, saying, Abide till the morning earely, and we shall kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Samson slept till midnight, and arose at midnight, and tooke the doores of the gates of the citie, and the two postes and lift them away with the barres, and put them vpon his shoulders, and caried them vp to the top of the mountaine that is before Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And after this hee loued a woman by the riuer of Sorek, whose name was Delilah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength [lieth], and by what [means] we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred  [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Delilah saide to Samson, Tell mee, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest bee bound, to doe thee hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Samson then answered vnto her, If they binde mee with seuen greene cordes, that were neuer dryed, then shall I bee weake, and be as an other man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the princes of the Philistims brought her seuen greene cordes that were not dry, and she bound him therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now [there were]  men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when  it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now  tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he answered her, If they binde mee with newe ropes that neuer were occupied, then shal I be weake, and be as an other man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Delilah therefore tooke newe ropes, and bounde him therewith, and saide vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson: (and men lay in wayte in the chamber) and hee brake them from his armes, as a threede.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.  And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she fastened it with a pinne, and saide vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson; he awoke out of his sleepe, and went away with the pinne of the webbe and the woufe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said unto him, How canst thou say,  I love thee, when thine heart [is] not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength [lieth].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And because shee was importunate vpon him with her wordes continually, and vexed him, his soule was pained vnto the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That he told her all his  heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I [have been] a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any [other] man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Delilah sawe that he had tolde her all his heart, she sent, and called for the Princes of ye Philistims, saying, Come vp once againe: for he hath shewed mee all his heart. Then the Princes of the Philistims came vp vnto her, and brought the money in their handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went  from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then she said, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson; hee awoke out of his sleepe, and thought, I will go out now as at other times, and shake my selfe, but he knewe not that the Lorde was departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore the Philistims tooke him, and put out his eyes, and brought him downe to Azzah, and bounde him with fetters: and hee did grinde in the prison house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Howbeit the hair of his head began to  grow again after he was shaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the Princes of the Philistims gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice vnto Dagon their god, and to reioyce: for they said, Our god hath deliuered Samson our enemie into our handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Also when the people saw him, they praysed their god: for they sayde, Our god hath deliuered into our hands our enemie and destroyer of our countrey, which hath slayne many of vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he  made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Samson saide vnto the seruant that led him by the hande, Lead me, that I may touch the pillars that the house standeth vpon, and that I may leane to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>(Nowe the house was full of men and women, and there were all the princes of the Philistims: also vpon the roofe were about three thousande men and women that behelde while Samson played)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once  avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Samson layd hold on the two middle pillars whereupon the house stood, and on which it was borne vp: on the one with his right hand, and on the other with his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Samson said,  Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with [all his] might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that [were] therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than [they] which he slew in his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then his brethren, and all the house of his father came downe and tooke him, and brought him vp and buryed him betweene Zorah & Eshtaol, in the sepulchre of Manoah his father: nowe he had iudged Israel twenty yeeres.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
