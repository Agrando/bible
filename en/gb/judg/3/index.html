And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD  strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gathered vnto him the children of Ammon, and Amalek, & went and smote Israel, and they possessed the citie of palme trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the children of Israel serued Eglon king of Moab eighteene yeeres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the children of Israel cried vnto the Lorde, the Lorde stirred them vp a sauiour, Ehud the sonne of Gera the sonne of Iemini, a man lame of his right hande: and the children of Israel sent a present by him vnto Eglon King of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ehud made him a dagger with two edges of a cubite length, and he did gird it vnder his rayment vpon his right thigh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he presented ye gift vnto Eglon King of Moab (and Eglon was a very fat man)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had now presented the present, he sent away the people that bare ye present,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he himself turned again from the  quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep  silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Ehud came vnto him. (and he sate alone in a sommer parler, which he had) and Ehud said, I haue a message vnto thee from God. Then he arose out of his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud put forth his left hand, & tooke the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his bellie,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that the hafte went in after the blade, and the fatte closed about the blade, so that he could not drawe the dagger out of his bellie, but the dirt came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud gate him out into the porch, and shut the doores of the parler vpon him, and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he was gone out, his seruantes came: who seeing that the doores of the parler were locked, they sayd, Surely he doeth his easement in his sommer chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they taryed till they were ashamed: & seeing he opened not the doores of the parler, they tooke the key, and opened them, & behold, their lord was fallen dead on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Ehud escaped (while they taried) & was passed the quarris, and escaped vnto Seirah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he came home, he blew a trumpet in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel went downe with him from the mountaine, and he went before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said he vnto them, Follow me: for the Lorde hath deliuered your enemies, euen Moab into your hand. So they went downe after him, & tooke the passages of Iorden towarde Moab, and suffred not a man to passe ouer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they slewe of the Moabites the same time about ten thousand men, all fed men, & all were warriours, and there escaped not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.
