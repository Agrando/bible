And they did chide with him sharply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of  you? [Is] not the  gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God hath deliuered into your handes the princes of Midian, Oreb & Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? & when he had thus spoken, then their spirits abated toward him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Gideon came to Iorden to passe ouer, hee, and the three hundreth men that were with him, weary, yet pursuing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you,  loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they [be] faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the princes of Succoth said, [Are] the  hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Gideon then sayde, Therefore when the Lorde hath deliuered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, I will teare your flesh with thornes of the wildernes and with breers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he went vp thence to Penuel, and spake vnto them likewise, and the men of Penuel answered him, as the men of Succoth answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again  in peace, I will break down this tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Zebah and Zalmunna [were]  in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand [men], all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in  tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, hee followed after them, and tooke the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the hoste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle  before the sun [was up],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And tooke a seruant of the me of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he wrote to him the princes of Succoth and the Elders thereof, euen seuentie and seuen men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he came vnto the men of Succoth, & sayd, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, by whome ye vpbrayded me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah & Zalmunna already in thine hands, that we should giue bread vnto thy weary men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he tooke the Elders of the citie, and thornes of the wildernes & breers, & did teare the men of Succoth with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also he brake downe the towre of Penuel, and slew the men of the citie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then saide he vnto Zebah & Zalmunna, What maner of men were they, whom ye slew at Tabor? and they answered, As thou art, so were they: euery one was like the children of a King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, They [were] my brethren, [even] the  sons of my mother: [as] the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he sayde vnto Iether his first borne sonne, Vp, & slay them: but the boy drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet yong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for  as the man [is, so is] his strength.
