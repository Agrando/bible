It is a place which doeth lacke nothing that is in the worlde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then there departed thence of the familie of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, sixe hundreth men appointed with instruments of warre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went vp, and pitched in Kiriath-iearim in Iudah: wherefore they called that place, Mahaneh-Dan vnto this day: and it is behinde Kiriath-iearim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went thence vnto mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Michah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren,  Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they turned thitherward & came to the house of the yong man the Leuite, euen vnto the house of Michah, and saluted him peaceably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the six hundreth men appointed with their weapons of warre, which were of the children of Dan, stoode by the entring of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, [and] came in thither, [and] took the  graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men [that were] appointed with weapons of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the other went into Michahs house and fet the grauen image, the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the molten image. Then saide the Priest vnto them, What doe ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they answered him, Holde thy peace: lay thine hande vpon thy mouth, and come with vs to be our father and Priest. Whether is it better that thou shouldest be a Priest vnto ye house of one man, or that thou shouldest be a Priest vnto a tribe and to a familie in Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the  people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage  before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they were farre off from the house of Michah, the men that were in the houses neere to Michahs house, gathered together, and pursued after the children of Dan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And cryed vnto the children of Dan: who turned their faces, and said vnto Michah, What ayleth thee, that thou makest an outcrie?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, Ye have taken away my  gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what [is] this [that] ye say unto me, What aileth thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the children of Dan sayde vnto him, Let not thy voyce be heard among vs, least angrie fellowes runne vpon thee, and thou lose thy life with the liues of thine housholde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the children of Dan went their wayes: and when Michah saw that they were too strong for him, hee turned, and went backe vnto his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they took [the  things] which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people [that were] at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there was none to helpe, because Laish was farre from Zidon, and they had no businesse with other men: also it was in the valley that lyeth by Beth-rehob. After, they built the citie, and dwelt therein,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And called the name of the citie Dan, after the name of Dan their father which was borne vnto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the children of Dan set up the  graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the  captivity of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So they set them vp the grauen image, which Michah had made, all the while the house of God was in Shiloh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
