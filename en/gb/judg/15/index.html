But her father would not suffer him to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And her father sayde, I thought that thou hadst hated her: therefore gaue I her to thy companion. Is not her yonger sister fayrer then shee? take her, I pray thee, in stead of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more  blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samson went out, and tooke three hundreth foxes, and tooke firebrands, and turned them taile to taile, and put a firebrand in ye middes betweene two tailes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he had set the brands on fire, he let [them] go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the  shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards [and] olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the  Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and  burnt her and her father with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Samson saide vnto them, Though yee haue done this, yet wil I be auenged of you, and then I wil cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So hee smote them hippe and thigh with a mightie plague: then hee went and dwelt in the top of the rocke Etam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the Philistims came vp, and pitched in Iudah, and were spred abroad in Lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To  bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines [are] rulers over us?  what [is] this [that] thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Againe they sayd vnto him, Wee are come to binde thee, and to deliuer thee into the hande of the Philistims; Samson sayde vnto them, Sweare vnto me, that yee will not fall vpon me your selues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and  deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When hee came to Lehi, the Philistims shouted against him, and the Spirite of the Lord came vpon him, and the cordes that were vpon his armes, became as flaxe that was burnt with fire: for the bandes loosed from his handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he found a  new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samson sayd, With the iaw of an asse are heapes vpon heapes: with the iawe of an asse haue I slaine a thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he had left speaking, hee cast away the iawebone out of his hande, and called that place, Ramath-Lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he was sore athirst, and  called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then God brake the cheeke tooth, that was in the iawe, and water came thereout: and when he had drunke, his Spirit came againe, and he was reuiued: wherefore the name therof is called, Enhakkore, which is in Lehi vnto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And hee iudged Israel in the dayes of the Philistims twentie yeeres.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
