shortly after this, Lysias the kings steward, and a kinsman of his, which had the gouernance of the affaires, tooke sore displeasure for the things that were done.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 And when he had gathered about fourescore thousand, with all the horsemen, he came against the Iewes, thinking to make the citie an habitation of the Gentiles.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 And the temple would he haue to get money by, like the other temples of the heathen: for hee would sell the Priests office euery yeere.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 And thus being puffed vp in his minde, because of the great number of footemen, and thousands of horsemen, & in his fourescore Elephants,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 He came into Iudea, and drew neere to Bethsura, which was a castle of defence, fiue furlongs from Ierusalem, and layde sore siege vnto it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 But when Maccabeus, and his companie knew that he besieged the holdes, they, and all the people made prayers with weeping, and teares before the Lord, that he would send a good Angel to deliuer Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 And Maccabeus him selfe first of all tooke weapons, exhorting the other that they would ieoparde themselues together with him to helpe their brethren: so they went forth together with a couragious minde.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 And as they were there besides Ierusalem, there appeared before them vpon horsebacke a man in white cloathing, shaking his harnesse of golde.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 Then they praysed the mercifull God all together, and tooke heart, in so much that they were ready, not onely to fight with men, but with the most cruell beasts, and to breake downe walles of yron.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 Thus they marched forwarde in aray, hauing an helper from heauen: for the Lord was mercifull vnto them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 And running vpon their enemies like lions, they slew eleuen thousande footemen, and sixteene hundreth horsemen, and put all the other to flight.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 Many of them also being wounded, escaped

the things that you demande by writing, and required mee to fulfill the things that they had declared.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 Therefore what things soeuer were meete to be reported to the King himselfe, I haue declared them, and he granted that that was possible.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 Therefore if ye behaue your selues as friends toward
