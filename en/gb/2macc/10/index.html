now and his company, through the helpe of the Lorde, wanne the Temple and the citie againe,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 And destroyed the altars, and chappels that the heathen had builded in the open places,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 And clensed the Temple, and made another altar, and burned stones, and tooke fire of them, and offered sacrifices, and incense two yeeres, and sixe moneths after, and set foorth the lampes, and the shewbread.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 When that was done, they fell downe flat vpon the grounde, and besought the Lorde, that they might come no more into such troubles: but if they sinned any more against him, that hee him selfe woulde chasten them with mercy, and that they might not bee deliuered to the blasphemous, and barbarous nations.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 Nowe vpon the same day, that the straungers polluted the Temple, on the very same day it was clensed againe, euen the fiue and twentie day of the same moneth, which is Chasleu.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 They kept eight dayes with gladnesse as in the feast of the Tabernacles, remembring, that not long afore they held the feast of the Tabernacles when they liued in the mountaines and dennes like beastes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 And for the same cause they bare greene boughes, and faire branches and palmes, and sang Psalmes vnto him that had giuen them good successe in clensing his place.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 They ordeined also by a common statute and decree, that euery yeere those dayes should be kept of the whole nation of the Iewes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 And this was the ende of Antiochus called Epiphanes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 Nowe will we declare the actes of Antiochus Eupator, which was the sonne of this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities of the warres, that followed.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 For when he had taken the kingdome, hee made one Lysias, which had bene captaine of the hoste in Phenice, and Coelosyria, ruler ouer the affaires of the realme.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 For Ptolemeus that was called Macron, purposed to doe iustice vnto the Iewes for the wrong, that had bene done vnto them, and went about to behaue himselfe peaceably with them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 For the which cause hee was accused of his friendes before Eupator, and was called oft times traitour, because he had left Cyprus that Philometor had committed vnto him, and came to Antiochus Epiphanes: therefore seeing that hee was no more in estimation, he was discouraged, and poysoned himselfe, and died.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 But when Gorgias was gouernour of the same places, hee interteined strangers, and made warre oft times against the Iewes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 Moreouer the Idumeans that helde the strong holdes, which were meete for their purpose, troubled the Iewes, and by receiuing them that were driuen from Ierusalem, tooke in hande to continue warre.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 Then they that were with Maccabeus made prayers, and besought God that he woulde be their helper, and so they fell vpon the strong holdes of the Idumeans,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 And assaulted them sore, that they wan the places, and slewe all that sought against them on the wall, and killed all that they met with, & slewe no lesse then twentie thousand.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 And because certaine (which were no lesse then nine thousand) were fled into two strong castles, hauing all maner of things conuenient to susteine the siege,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 Maccabeus left Simon, and Ioseph, and Zaccheus also, and those that were with them, which were inowe to besiege them, and departed to those places which were more necessarie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 Nowe they that were with Simon, being led with couetousnes, were intreated for mony (through certaine of those that were in the castel) & tooke seuentie thousand drachmes, and let some of them escape.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 But when it was tolde Maccabeus what was done, hee called the gouernours of the people together, and accused those men, that they had solde their brethren for money, and let their enemies goe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>{\cf2 So he slew them when they were conuict of treason, and immediately wan the two castels:}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 And hauing good successe, as in al the warres that he tooke in hande, hee slewe in the two castels moe then twentie thousand.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>{\cf2 Nowe Timotheus whom the Iewes had ouercome afore, gathered an armie of strangers of al sorts, and brought a great troupe of horsemen out of Asia to winne Iewrie by strength.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>{\cf2 But when hee drewe neere, Maccabeus and they that were with him, turned to pray vnto God, and sprinkled earth vpon their heads, and girded their reines with sackcloth,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>{\cf2 And fell downe at the foote of the altar, and besought the Lorde to bee mercifull to them, and to bee an enemie to their enemies, and to bee an aduersarie to their aduersaries, as the Lawe declareth.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>{\cf2 So after ye prayer, they tooke their weapons, and went on further from the citie, and when they came neere to the enemies, they tooke heede to themselues.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 And when the morning appeared, they both ioyned together: the one part had the Lord for their refuge, and pledge of prosperitie, and noblevictorie, and the other tooke courage as a guide of the warre.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 But when the battel waxed strong, there appeared vnto the enemies from heauen fiue comely men vpon horses with bridles of golde, and two of them led the Iewes,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 And tooke Maccabeus betwixt them, and couered him on euery side with their weapons, and kept him safe, but shot dartes, and lightnings against the enemies, so that they were confounded with blindenesse, and beaten downe and full of trouble.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 There were slaine of foote men twentie thousande and fiue hundreth, and sixe hundreth horsemen.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 As for Timotheus himselfe, he fled vnto Gazara, which was called a very strong holde, wherein Chereas was captaine.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>{\cf2 But Maccabeus and his company layde siege against the fortresses with courage for foure dayes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>{\cf2 And they that were within, trusting to the height of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and spake horrible wordes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>{\cf2 Neuerthelesse vpon the fifth daye in the morning, twentie yong men of Maccabeus companie, whose heartes were inflamed, because of the blasphemies, came vnto the wall, and with bolde stomakes smote downe those that they met.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>{\cf2 Others also that climed vp vpon the engines of warre against them that were within, set fire vpo the towres, and burnt those blasphemers quicke with the fires that they had made, and others brake vp the gates, and receiued the rest of the armie, and tooke the citie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>{\cf2 And hauing founde Timotheus, that was crept into a caue, they killed him, and Chereas his brother with Apollophanes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>{\cf2 When this was done, they praysed the Lorde with psalmes, and thanksgiuing, which had done so great thinges for Israel, and giuen them the victorie.}</span>
