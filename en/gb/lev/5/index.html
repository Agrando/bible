if he do not utter [it], then he shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Either if one touche any vncleane thing, whether it be a carion of an vncleane beast, or a carion of vncleane cattel, or a carion of vncleane creeping things, and is not ware of it, yet he is vncleane, and hath offended:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Eyther if hee touche any vncleannesse of man (whatsoeuer vncleannes it be, that hee is defiled with) and is not ware of it, and after commeth to the knowledge of it, he hath sinned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or if a soul  swear, pronouncing with [his] lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever [it be] that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth [of it], then he shall be guilty in one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these  [things], that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that [thing]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore shall he bring his trespasse offring vnto the Lord for his sinne which he hath committed, euen a female from ye flocke, be it a lambe or a she goat for a sinne offring, and the Priest shall make an atonement for him, concerning his sinne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if he be not able to bring a sheepe, he shall bring for his trespas which he hath committed, two turtle doues, or two yong pigeons vnto the Lord, one for a sinne offring, and the other for a burnt offring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So he shall bring them vnto the Priest, who shall offer the sinne offring first, and wring the necke of it a sunder, but not plucke it cleane off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sinne offring vpon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be shed at the foote of the altar: for it is a sinne offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he shall offer the second [for] a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall  make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an  ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no  oil upon it, neither shall he put [any] frankincense thereon: for it [is] a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall hee bring it to the Priest, and the Priest shall take his handfull of it for the remembrance thereof, and burne it vpon the altar with the offrings of the Lorde made by fire: for it is a sinne offring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Priest shal make an atonement for him, as touching his sinne that he hath committed in one of these poyntes, and it shall bee forgiuen him: and the remnant shalbe the Priests, as the meate offring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance,  in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks,  with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So hee shall restore that wherein hee hath offended, in taking away of the holy thing, and shall put the fift part more thereto, and giue it vnto the Priest: so the Priest shal make an atonement for him with the ram of ye trespasse offring, and it shalbe forgiuen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD;
