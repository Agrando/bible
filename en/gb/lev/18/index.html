vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>After the  doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But do after my iudgementes, and keepe mine ordinances, to walke therein: I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them:  I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to  uncover [their] nakedness: I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy father, nor the shame of thy mother: for she is thy mother, thou shalt not discouer her shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The nakedness of thy father's  wife shalt thou not uncover: it [is] thy father's nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The nakedness of thy  sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, [whether she be] born at home, or born abroad, [even] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, [even] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs [is] thine own  nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The shame of thy fathers wiues daughter, begotten of thy father (for she is thy sister) thou shalt not, I say, discouer her shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a

sister: for she is thy mothers kinsewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy  father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she [is] thine aunt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy daughter in lawe: for she is thy sonnes wife: therefore shalt thou not vncouer her shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy  brother's wife: it [is] thy brother's nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shalt not discouer the shame of the wife and of her daughter, neither shalt thou take her sonnes daughter, nor her daughters daughter, to vncouer her shame: for they are thy kinsfolkes, and it were wickednesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to  vex [her], to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life [time].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put  apart for her uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a

of thy seed pass through [the fire] to  Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou shalt not lie with ye male as one lieth with a woman: for it is abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thou shalt not also lie with any beast to bee defiled therewith, neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie downe thereto: for it is abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yee shall not defile your selues in any of these things: for in al these the nations are defiled, which I will cast out before you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the land is defiled: therefore I do  visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself  vomiteth out her inhabitants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ye shall keepe therefore mine ordinances, and my iudgementes, and commit none of these abominations, aswell hee that is of the same countrey, as the straunger that soiourneth among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>(For all these abominations haue the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it  spued out the nations that [were] before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a

Lorde your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
