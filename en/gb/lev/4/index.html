spake vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through  ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD [concerning things] which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If  the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and  kill the bullock before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Priest that is anointed shall take of the bullocks blood, and bring it into the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the  sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the priest shall put [some] of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which [is] in the  tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which [is at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And hee shall take away all the fat of the bullocke for the sinne offring: to wit, the fat that couereth the inwardes, and all the fatte that is about the inwardes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He shall take away also the two kidneis, and the fat that is vpon them, and vpon the flankes, and the kall vpon the liuer with the kidneis,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it was taken away from the bullock of the peace offrings, & the Priest shall burne them vpon the altar of burnt offring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the skinne of the bullocke, and all his flesh, with his heade, and his legs, and his inwardes, and his dung shal he beare out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So he shall cary the whole bullocke out of the host vnto a cleane place, where the ashes are powred, & shall burne him on ye wood in the fire: where ye ashes are cast out, shal he be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if the  whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done [somewhat against] any of the commandments of the LORD [concerning things] which should not be done, and are guilty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the sinne which they haue committed shalbe knowen, then the Congregation shall offer a yong bullocke for the sinne, & bring him before the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the  elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the Priest that is anointed, shall bring of the bullockes blood into the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seuen times before the Lord, euen before the vaile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Also he shall put some of ye blood vpon the hornes of the altar, which is before the Lord, that is in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: then shall he powre all the rest, of the blood at ye foote of the altar of burnt offring, which is at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he shall take all his fat from him, and burne it vpon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Priest shal doe with this bullocke, as he did with the bullocke for his sinne: so shall he do with this: so the Priest shal make an atonement for them, and it shalbe forgiuen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For he shal carie the bullocke without the hoste, and burne him as he burned the first bullock: for it is an offring for the sinne of the Congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When a ruler shal sinne, and do through ignorance against any of the commaundementes of the Lorde his God, which should not be done, and shall offend,</span> <span

name="24">24</a>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it  in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it [is] a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the Priest shall take of the blood of the sinne offring with his finger, and put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offring altar, and shall powre the rest of his blood at the foote of the burnt offring altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make  an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Likewise if any of the people of ye lande shall sinne through ignoraunce in doing against any of the commandements of the Lord, which should not be done, and shall offend,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If one shewe him his sinne which he hath committed, then he shall bring for his offring, a shee goate without blemish for his sinne which he hath committed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the Priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offring altar, & powre all the rest of the blood thereof at the foote of the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And shall take away all his fat, as the fat of the peace offringes is taken away, and the Priest shall burne it vpon the altar for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde, and the Priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shalbe forgiuen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And if he bring a lambe for his sinne offring, he shall bring a female without blemish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he shall lay his  hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the Priest shall take of the blood of the sinne offring with his finger, and put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offring altar, and shall powre al the rest of the blood thereof at the foote of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar,  according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
