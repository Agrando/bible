for it [is] their perpetual possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and  fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: [yea, though he be] a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou shalt take no vsurie of him, nor vantage, but thou shalt feare thy God, that thy brother may liue with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou shalt not giue him thy money to vsurie, nor lende him thy vitailes for increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I am the Lorde your God, which haue brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to giue you the lande of Canaan, and to be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>If thy brother also that dwelleth by thee, be impouerished, and be sold vnto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serue as a bond seruant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But as an hired seruant, and as a soiourner he shalbe with thee: he shall serue thee vnto the yeere of the Iubile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shall he depart from thee, both hee, and his children with him, and shall returne vnto his familie, and vnto the possession of his fathers shall he returne:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For they [are] my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not  be sold as bondmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou shalt not rule ouer him cruelly, but shalt feare thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thy bond seruant also, & thy bond maid, which thou shalt haue, shalbe of the heathen that are rounde about you: of them shall ye bye seruants and maydes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that [are] with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your  possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So ye shall take them as inheritance for your children after you, to possesse them by inheritance, ye shall vse their labours for euer: but ouer your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule one ouer another with crueltie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If a soiourner or a stranger dwelling by thee get riches, & thy brother by him be impouerished, and sell him selfe vnto the stranger or soiourner dwelling by thee, or to the stocke of the strangers familie,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>After that he is solde, he may be bought out: one of his brethren may bye him out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or [any] that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or  if he be able, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of  years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there be many yeeres behind, according to them he shall giue againe for his deliuerance, of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>If there remaine but fewe yeeres vnto the yeere of Iubile, then he shall count with him, and according to his yeeres giue againe for his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>[And] as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: [and the other] shall not rule with rigour over him in thy  sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if he be not redeemed thus, he shal go out in the yeere of Iubile, he, and his children with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For vnto me the children of Israel are seruants: they are my seruants, who I haue brought out of the land of Egypt: I am ye Lord your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
