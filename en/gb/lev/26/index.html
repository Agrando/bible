and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you  seven times more for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as  iron, and your earth as brass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And your strength shalbe spent in vaine: neither shall your lande giue her increase, neither shall the trees of the land giue their fruite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if ye walk  contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall  rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your  [high] ways shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet if by these ye will not be reformed by me, but walke stubburnly against me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then wil I also walke stubburnly against you, and I will smite you yet seuen times for your sinnes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I wil send a sword vpon you, that shal auenge the quarel of my couenant: and when ye are gathered in your cities, I wil send the pestilence among you, and ye shall be deliuered into the hand of the enemie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[And] when I have broken the  staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one  oven, and they shall deliver [you] your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yet if ye will not for this obey mee, but walke against me stubburnly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then will I walke stubburnly in mine anger against you, and I will also chastice you seuen times more according to your sinnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And ye shall eate ye flesh of your sonnes, & the flesh of your daughters shall ye deuoure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will also destroy your hye places, & cut away your images, and cast your carkeises vpon the bodies of your idoles, and my soule shall abhorre you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I  will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I will also bring the land vnto a wildernes, and your enemies, which dwell therein, shalbe astonished thereat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Also I wil scatter you among the heathen, and will drawe out a sworde after you, & your land shalbe waste, & your cities shalbe desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the land inioy her Sabbaths, as long as it lieth voide, and yee shalbe in your enemies land: then shall the land rest, and enioy her Sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your  sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And upon them that are left [alive] of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall  flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They shall fall also one vpon another, as before a sword, though none pursue them, and ye shall not be able to stand before your enemies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye shall perish among the heathen, & the land of your enemies shall eate you vp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with  them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then they shall confesse their iniquitie, & the wickednes of their fathers for their trespasse, which they haue trespassed against mee, and also because they haue walked stubburnly against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Therefore I wil walke stubburnly against them, and bring them into the land of their enemies: so then their vncircumcised hearts shalbe humbled, and then they shalt willingly beare the punishment of their iniquitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then I will remember my couenant with Iaakob, and my couenant also with Izhak, and also my couenant with Abraham will I remember, and will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Yet notwithstanding this, when they shalbe in the lande of their enemies, I wil not cast them away, neither will I abhorre them, to destroy them vtterly, nor to breake my couenant with them: for I am the Lord their God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But I will for their sakes remember the  covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I [am] the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These [are] the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount  Sinai by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
