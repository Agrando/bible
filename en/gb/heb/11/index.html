and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a  rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he abode in the land of promes, as in a strange countrey, as one that dwelt in tents with Isaac and Iacob heires with him of the same promes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he looked for a city which hath  foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Through faith Sara also receiued strength to conceiue seede, and was deliuered of a childe when she was past age, because she iudged him faithfull which had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as  dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died in  faith, not having received the  promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and  embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they that say such things, declare plainely, that they seeke a countrey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if they had bene mindfull of that countrey, from whence they came out, they had leasure to haue returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But nowe they desire a better, that is an heauenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a citie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was  tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the  promises offered up his only begotten [son],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(To whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seede be called.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from  whence also he received him in  a figure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not  afraid of the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses when he was come to age, refused to be called the sonne of Pharaohs daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the  pleasures of sin for a season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches then the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect vnto the recompence of the reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he forsooke Egypt, and feared not the fiercenes of the king: for he endured, as he that sawe him which is inuisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Through faith he ordeined the Passeouer and the effusion of blood, least he that destroyed the first borne, should touche them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith the  harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the  spies with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of] David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained  promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sworde, of weake were made strong, waxed valiant in battell, turned to flight the armies of the aliants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were  tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And others haue bene tryed by mockings and scourgings, yea, moreouer by bondes and prisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in  sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Whom the world was not worthie of: they wandered in wildernesses and mountaines, and dennes, and caues of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received  not the promise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God having provided some better thing for us, that they  without us should not be made perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
