See, saide hee, that thou make all thinges according to the paterne, shewed to thee in the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the  house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Not like the Testament that I made with their fathers, in the day that I tooke them by the hand, to leade them out of the land of Egypt: for they continued not in my Testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is the Testament that I will make with the house of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my Lawes in their minde, and in their heart I will write them, and I wil be their God, and they shalbe my people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they shall not teache euery man his neighbour and euery man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall knowe me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will bee mercifull to their vnrighteousnes, and I wil remember their sinnes and their iniquities no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old.
