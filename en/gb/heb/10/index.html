He taketh away the  first, that he may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By the which wil we are sanctified, euen by the offring of the body of Iesus Christ once made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every priest standeth  daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes, sitteth for euer at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For with one offering hath he consecrated for euer them that are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the Testament that I will make vnto them after those dayes, sayth the Lord, I wil put my Lawes in their heart, and in their mindes I will write them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And their sins and iniquities will I remember  no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for  sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his  flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And seeing we haue an hie Priest, which is ouer the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let us draw near with a  true heart in full assurance of faith, having our  hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with  pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And washed in our bodies with pure water, let vs keepe the profession of our hope, without wauering, (for he is faithfull that promised)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let vs consider one another, to prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]:  and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we sin  wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the  adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Of howe much sorer punishment suppose ye shall hee be worthy, which treadeth vnder foote the Sonne of God, and counteth the blood of the Testament as an vnholy thing, wherewith he was sanctified, and doeth despite the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord.
