who for the  joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For whom the Lord loueth, he chasteneth: and he scourgeth euery sonne that he receiueth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If ye endure chastening, God offereth him selfe vnto you as vnto sonnes: for what sonne is it whom the father chasteneth not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If therefore ye be without correction, whereof al are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sonnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected [us], and we gave [them] reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they verily for a few days chastened [us] after their own pleasure; but he for [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now no chastising for the present seemeth to be ioyous, but, grieuous: but afterwarde, it bringeth the quiet fruite of righteousnesse, vnto them which are thereby exercised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore lift up the hands which  hang down, and the feeble knees;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And make  straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow peace with all [men], and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any  root of bitterness springing up trouble [you], and thereby many be defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lest there [be] any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no  place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For ye are not come unto the mount that might be  touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Neither vnto the sounde of a trumpet, and the voyce of wordes, which they that heard it, excused themselues, that the word should not be spoken to them any more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(For they were not able to abide that which was commaunded, yea, though a beast touche the mountaine, it shalbe stoned, or thrust through with a dart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so terrible was the  sight, [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But ye are come vnto the mount Sion, and to the citie of the liuing God, the celestiall Hierusalem, and to ye company of innumerable Angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made  perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And to Iesus the Mediatour of the new Testament, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things then that of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more [shall not] we [escape], if we turn away from him that [speaketh] from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying,  Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this worde, Yet once more, signifieth the remouing of those things which are shaken, as of things which are made with hands, that the things which are not shaken, may remaine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with  reverence and godly  fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For euen our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
