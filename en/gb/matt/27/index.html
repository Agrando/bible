They all said to him, Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then saide the gouernour, But what euill hath he done? Then they cryed the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but [that] rather a tumult was made, he took water, and  washed [his] hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the  blood of this just person: see ye [to it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then answered all the people, and said,  His blood [be] on us, and on our children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus let he Barabbas loose vnto them, and scourged Iesus, and deliuered him to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the souldiers of the gouernour tooke Iesus into the common hall, and gathered about him the whole band,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they stripped him, and  put on him a  scarlet robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And platted a crowne of thornes, and put it vpon his head, and a reede in his right hand, and bowed their knees before him, and mocked him, saying, God saue thee King of the Iewes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And spitted vpon him, and tooke a reede, and smote him on the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus when they had mocked him, they tooke the robe from him, and put his owne rayment on him, and led him away to crucifie him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they  compelled to bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted [thereof], he would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they sate, and watched him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And saying, Thou that destroyest ye Temple, & buildest it in three dayes, saue thy selfe: if thou be ye Sonne of God, come downe fro ye crosse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Likewise also the hie Priests mocking him, with the Scribes, and Elders, and Pharises, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He saued others, but he cannot saue him selfe: if he be ye King of Israel, let him now come downe from ye crosse, and we will beleeue in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusted in God, let him deliuer him nowe, if he will haue him: for he saide, I am the Sonne of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The  thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou  forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Some of them that stood there, when they heard [that], said, This [man] calleth for  Elias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And straightway one of them ran, & tooke a spondge, and filled it with vineger, and put it on a reede, and gaue him to drinke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Other said, Let be: let vs see, if Elias wil come and saue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, behold, the  veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the  graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And came out of the graues after his resurrection, and went into the holy citie, and appeared vnto many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Iesus, saw the earthquake, and the thinges that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truely this was the Sonne of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And many women were there, beholding him a farre off, which had folowed Iesus from Galile, ministring vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Among whom was Marie Magdalene, and Marie the mother of Iames, & Ioses, and the mother of Zebedeus sonnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>He went to Pilate, & asked ye body of Iesus. Then Pilate commanded ye body to be deliuered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So Ioseph tooke the body, and wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And put it in his new tombe, which he had hewen out in a rocke, and rolled a great stone to the doore of the sepulchre, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And there was Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie sitting ouer against the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And said, Syr, we remember that that deceiuer saide, while he was yet aliue, Within three dayes I will rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Command therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure vntill the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steale him away, and say vnto the people, He is risen from the dead: so shall the last errour be worse then the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a  watch: go your way, make [it] as sure as ye can.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And they went, and made the sepulchre sure with the watch, and sealed the stone.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
