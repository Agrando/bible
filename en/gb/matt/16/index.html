O [ye] hypocrites, ye can discern the  face of the sky; but can ye not [discern] the signs of the times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but  the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Iesus said vnto them, Take heede and beware of the leauen of the Pharises & Sadduces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they reasoned among themselues, saying, It is because we haue brought no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>[Which] when Jesus  perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the  five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Neither the seuen loaues when there were foure thousande men, and howe many baskets tooke ye vp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How is it that ye do not  understand that I  spake [it] not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then vnderstood they that he had not said that they should beware of the leauen of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharises, and Sadduces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus came into the coasts of  Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they said, Some [say that thou art]  John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said vnto them, But whome say ye that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Simon Peter answered, & said, Thou art that Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for  flesh and blood hath not revealed [it] unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I say also unto thee, That thou art  Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the  gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give unto thee the  keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt  bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the  elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Peter  took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me,  Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou  savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall  find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what shall it profite a man though he should winne the whole worlde, if hee lose his owne soule?
