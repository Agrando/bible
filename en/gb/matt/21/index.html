And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast  perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And seeing a figge tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaues onely, and said to it, Neuer fruite grow on thee henceforwards; anon the figge tree withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when his disciples saw it, they marueiled, saying, How soone is the figge tree withered!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and  doubt not, ye shall not only do this [which is done] to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatsoeuer ye shall aske in prayer, if ye beleeue, ye shall receiue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what  authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you  one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The  baptism of John, whence was it? from  heaven, or of men? And they  reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if we say, Of men, we feare the multitude, for all holde Iohn as a Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they answered Iesus, and said, We can not tell; he said vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But what thinke ye? A certaine man had two sonnes, and came to the elder, and saide, Sonne, goe and worke to day in my vineyarde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he answered, and said, I will not: yet afterward he repented himselfe, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then came he to the second, and said likewise; he answered, and said, I will, Syr: yet he went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether of them twain did the will of [his] father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots  go into the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came unto you in the  way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen [it], repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a  tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the time of the fruite drewe neere, hee sent his seruants to the husbandmen to receiue the fruites thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And ye husbandmen tooke his seruants and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Againe hee sent other seruants, moe then the first: and they did the like vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But last of all he sent vnto them his owne sonne, saying, They will reuerence my sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us  seize on his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So they tooke him, and cast him out of the vineyarde, and slewe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When therefore the Lorde of the vineyarde shall come, what will hee doe to those husbandmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say unto him, He will  miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out [his] vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the  builders rejected, the same is  become the  head of the corner:  this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the  fruits thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will  grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when the chiefe Priestes and Pharises had heard his parables, they perceiued that hee spake of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
