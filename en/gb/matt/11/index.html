A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that weare soft clothing, are in Kings houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what went ye out to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say vnto you, and more then a Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he of whom it is written, Beholde, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the  kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the time of Iohn Baptist hitherto, the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law  prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if ye will receiue it, this is that Elias, which was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But whereunto shall I liken this generation?  It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And say, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced, we haue mourned vnto you, and ye haue not lamented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Iohn came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a deuill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.  But  wisdom is justified of her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe be to thee, Chorazin: Woe be to thee, Bethsaida: for if ye great workes, which were done in you, had bene done in Tyrus and Sidon, they had repented long agone in sackecloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you, It shalbe easier for Tyrus and Sidon at the day of iudgement, then for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou, Capernaum, which art lifted vp vnto heauen, shalt be brought downe to hell: for if the great workes, which haue bin done in thee, had bene done among them of Sodom, they had remained to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say vnto you, that it shall be easier for them of the land of Sodom in the day of iudgement, then for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast  revealed them unto babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even so, Father: for so it seemed  good in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] to whomsoever the Son will reveal [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come vnto me, all ye that are wearie and laden, and I will ease you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke on you, and learne of me that I am meeke and lowly in heart: and ye shall finde rest vnto your soules.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke [is]  easy, and my burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
