And they appoynted vnto him thirtie pieces of siluer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that time, he sought opportunitie to betraie him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now  the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Goe yee into the citie to such a man, and say to him, The master saieth, My time is at hande: I will keepe the Passeouer at thine house with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Iesus had giuen them charge, and made readie the Passeouer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now when the even was come, he  sat down with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as they did eate, he sayde, Verely I say vnto you, that one of you shall betraie me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were exceeding sorowfull, and began euery one of them to say vnto him, Is it I, Master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he answered and said, He that  dippeth [his] hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Surely the Sonne of man goeth his way, as it is written of him: but woe be to that man, by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had bene good for that man, if hee had neuer bene borne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas,  which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and  blessed [it], and brake [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;  this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye  all of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is my blood of the  new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I say vnto you, that I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the vine vntil that day, when I shal drinke it new with you in my Fathers kingdome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when they had sung  an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am risen againe, I will go before you into Galile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Peter aunswered, and sayde vnto him, Though that al men should be offended by thee, yet will I neuer be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Iesus sayde vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, that this night, before the cocke crow, thou shalt denie me thrise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter saide vnto him, Though I should die with thee, I will in no case denie thee. Likewise also sayd all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and  very heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible,  let this  cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch, and praie, that yee enter not into tentation: the spirit in deede is readie, but the flesh is weake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Againe he went away the second time, and praied, saying, O my Father, if this cuppe can not passe away from mee, but that I must drinke it, thy will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he came, and founde them a sleepe againe, for their eyes were heauie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he left them and went away againe, and praied the third time, saying the same woordes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then came he to his disciples, and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth, & take your rest: behold, the houre is at hand, and the Sonne of man is giuen into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,  from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now he that betraied him, had giuen them a token, saying, Whomesoeuer I shall kisse, that is he, laie holde on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And forthwith he came to Iesus, and sayd, God saue thee, Master, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said unto him,  Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, one of them which were with Iesus, stretched out his hand, & drewe his sworde, and strooke a seruaunt of the high Priest, and smote off his eare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that  take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The same houre sayde Iesus to the multitude, Ye be come out as it were against a thiefe, with swordes and staues to take mee: I sate daily teaching in the Temple among you, and yee tooke me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsooke him, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led [him] away to  Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's  palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Nowe the chiefe Priestes and the Elders, and all the whole councill sought false witnesse against Iesus, to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But they founde none, and though many false witnesses came, yet founde they none: but at the last came two false witnesses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And saide, This man saide, I can destroie the Temple of God, and build it in three daies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing?  what [is it which] these witness against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Iesus helde his peace. Then the chiefe Priest answered, and saide to him, I charge thee sweare vnto vs by the liuing God, to tell vs, If thou be that Christ the Sonne of God, or no.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you,  Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting  on the right hand of power, and coming in the  clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest  rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What thinke yee? They answered, and said, He is guiltie of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then spet they in his face, and buffeted him, and other smote him with roddes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Saying, Prophecie to vs, O Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter  sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But hee denied before them all, saying, I wote not what thou saiest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when hee went out into the porche, another maide sawe him, and sayde vnto them that were there, This man was also with Iesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And againe he denied with an oth, saying, I knowe not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>So after a while, came vnto him they that stoode by, and sayde vnto Peter, Surely thou art also one of them: for euen thy speache bewraieth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then began he to  curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>Then Peter remembred the wordes of Iesus, which had sayde vnto him, Before the cocke crowe thou shalt denie me thrise. So he went out, and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
