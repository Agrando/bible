kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and  went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And fiue of them were wise, & fiue foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The foolish tooke their lampes, but tooke none oyle with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the wise tooke oyle in their vessels with their lampes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While the bridegroom tarried, they all  slumbered and slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And at midnight there was a crie made, Behold, the bridegrome commeth: goe out to meete him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lampes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the foolish said to the wise, Giue vs of your oyle, for our lampes are out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise answered, saying, Not so, lest there will not be ynough for vs and you: but goe ye rather to them that sell, and bye for your selues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they went to bye, the bridegrome came: and they that were readie, went in with him to the wedding, and the gate was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he answered, and said, Verely I say vnto you, I knowe you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch therfore: for ye know neither the day, nor the houre, when the sonne of man will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling into a far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several  ability; and straightway took his journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he that had receiued the fiue talents, went and occupied with them, and gained other fiue talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Likewise also, he that receiued two, he also gained other two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he that receiued that one, went & digged it in the earth, and hid his masters money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But after a long season, the master of those seruants came, and reckoned with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came he that had receiued fiue talents, and brought other fiue talents, saying, Master, thou deliueredst vnto me fiue talents: behold, I haue gained with them other fiue talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things:  enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also he that had receiued two talents, came, and said, Master, thou deliueredst vnto me two talents: behold, I haue gained two other talets more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His master saide vnto him, It is well done good seruant, and faithfull, Thou hast bene faithfull in litle, I will make thee ruler ouer much: enter into thy masters ioy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he which had receiued the one talent, came, & said, Master, I knewe that thou wast an hard man, which reapest where thou sowedst not, and gatherest where thou strawedst not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I was therefore afraide, and went, & hid thy talent in the earth: behold, thou hast thine owne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And his master answered, & said vnto him, Thou euill seruant, and slouthfull, thou knewest that I reape where I sowed not, and gather where I strawed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the  exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take therefore the talent from him, and giue it vnto him which hath tenne talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For vnto euery man that hath, it shall be giuen, and he shall haue abundance, and from him that hath not, euen that he hath, shalbe taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cast therefore that vnprofitable seruant into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnasshing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And before him shalbe gathered all nations, & he shal seperate them one from another, as a shepheard separateth the sheepe from ye goates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he shall set the sheepe on his right hand, and the goates on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye  blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me drinke: I was a stranger, and ye tooke me in vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked, & ye clothed me: I was sicke, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came vnto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then shall the righteous answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or a thirst, and gaue thee drinke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when sawe we thee a stranger, and tooke thee in vnto vs? or naked, & clothed thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Or when sawe we thee sicke, or in prison, and came vnto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King shall answere, and say vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, in as much as ye haue done it vnto one of the least of these my brethre, ye haue done it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shal he say vnto them on ye left hand, Depart from me ye cursed, into euerlasting fire, which is prepared for the deuill and his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me no meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me no drinke:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger, & ye tooke me not in vnto you: I was naked, & ye clothed me not: sicke, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then shall they also answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an hungred, or a thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sicke, or in prison, and did not minister vnto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then shall he answere them, and say, Verely I say vnto you, in as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And these shall goe into euerlasting paine, and the righteous into life eternall.</span>
