She said to him, Graunt that these my two sonnes may sit, the one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy kingdome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to  drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the  baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is  not mine to give, but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the other ten heard this, they disdained at the two brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them [unto him], and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise  dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, let him be your seruant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Euen as the Sonne of man came not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the ransome of many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And beholde, two blinde men, sitting by the way side, when they heard that Iesus passed by, cryed, saying, O Lorde, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the multitude rebuked them, because they should holde their peace: but they cried the more, saying, O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus stood still, and  called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They saide to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Iesus mooued with compassion, touched their eyes, & immediatly their eyes receiued sight, and they followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
