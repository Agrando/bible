And he was  speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said the king to the  servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but fewe chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in [his] talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent out unto him their disciples with the  Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God  in truth, neither carest thou for any [man]: for thou regardest not the  person of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give  tribute unto Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Iesus perceiued their wickednes, and sayd, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a  penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he sayde vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They sayd vnto him, Cesars. Then sayd he vnto them, Giue therefore to Cesar, the things which are Cesars, and giue vnto God, those things which are Gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they heard it, they marueiled, and left him, and went their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no  children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nowe there were with vs seuen brethren, and the first maried a wife, and deceased: and hauing none yssue, left his wife vnto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise also the second, and the third, vnto the seuenth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seuen? For all had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Ye are deceiued, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the  angels of God in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And concerning the resurrection of the dead, haue ye not read what is spoken vuto you of God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the multitude heard it, they were astonied at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then  one of them, [which was] a lawyer, asked [him a question], tempting him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Master, which is ye great commaundement in the Lawe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy  soul, and with all thy mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and the great commaundement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy  neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandements hangeth the whole Lawe, and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, What think ye of Christ?  whose son is he? They say unto him, [The Son] of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He sayd vnto them, How then doeth Dauid in spirit call him Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The Lord sayd to my Lorde, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footestoole?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If then Dauid call him Lord, howe is he his sonne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And none could answere him a worde, neither durst any from that day foorth aske him any moe questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
