This is he which received seed by the way side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And hee that receiued seede in the stonie grounde, is he which heareth the woorde, and incontinently with ioy receiueth it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet hath he no roote in himselfe, and dureth but a season: for assoone as tribulation or persecution commeth because of the woorde, by and by he is offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And hee that receiued the seede among thornes, is hee that heareth the woorde: but the care of this worlde, and the deceitfulnesse of riches choke the word, and he is made vnfruitfull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that receiued the seede in the good ground, is he that heareth the worde, and vnderstandeth it, which also beareth fruite, and bringeth foorth, some an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, and some thirtie folde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But while men slept, there came his enemie, and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his waie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the blade was sprong vp, and brought forth fruite, then appeared the tares also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then came the seruaunts of the housholder, and sayd vnto him, Master, sowedst not thou good seede in thy fielde? from whence then hath it tares?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And hee said to them, Some enuious man hath done this. Then the seruants saide vnto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them vp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he saide, Nay, lest while yee goe about to gather the tares, yee plucke vp also with them the wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both growe together vntill the haruest, and in time of haruest I will say to the reapers, Gather yee first the tares, and binde them in sheaues to burne them: but gather the wheate into my barne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Which in deede is the least of all seedes: but when it is growen, it is the greatest among herbes, and it is a tree, so that the birdes of heauen come and builde in the branches thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable spake hee to them, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto leauen, which a woman taketh and hideth in three pecks of meale, till all be leauened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these thinges spake Iesus vnto the multitude in parables, and without parables spake he not to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, and will vtter the thinges which haue beene kept secrete from the foundation of the worlde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then sent Iesus the multitude away, and went into the house; his disciples came vnto him, saying, Declare vnto vs the parable of the tares of that fielde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the field is the worlde, and the good seede are the children of the kingdome, and the tares are the children of that wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the enemie that soweth them, is the deuill, and the haruest is the end of the worlde, and the reapers be the Angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As then the tares are gathered and burned in ye fire, so shal it be in the end of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Sonne of man shal send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which doe iniquitie,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And shall cast them into a fornace of fire. There shalbe wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then shall the iust men shine as ye sunne in the kingdome of their Father. Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like to a marchant man, that seeketh good pearles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who hauing found a pearle of great price, went and solde all that he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Which, when it is full, men draw to lande, and sit and gather the good into vessels, and cast the bad away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So shall it be at the end of the world. The Angels shall goe foorth, and seuer the bad from among the iust,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And shall cast them into a fornace of fire: there shalbe wailing, and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then sayd hee vnto them, Therefore euery Scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome of heauen, is like vnto an householder, which bringeth foorth out of his treasure things both newe and olde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to passe, that when Iesus had ended these parables, he departed thence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this [man] this wisdom, and [these] mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenters sonne? Is not his mother called Marie, and his brethren Iames and Ioses, and Simon and Iudas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And are not his sisters all with vs? Whence then hath he all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were offended with him. Then Iesus said to them, A Prophet is not without honour, saue in his owne countrey, and in his owne house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not many great woorkes there, for their vnbeliefes sake.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
