What therefore God hath  joined together, let not man put asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He saith unto them, Moses  because of the hardness of your hearts  suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except [it be]  for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples say unto him, If the  case of the man be so with [his] wife, it is not good to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said unto them, All [men] cannot  receive this saying, save [they] to whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are some  eunuchs, which were so born from [their] mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have  made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put [his] hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Iesus sayd, Suffer the litle children, and forbid them not to come to me: for of such is the kingdome of heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had put his hands on them, he departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, eue God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keepe ye commandemets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He sayd to him, Which? And Iesus sayde, These, Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honour thy father and mother: and thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The yong man sayd vnto him, I haue obserued all these things from my youth: what lacke I yet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said unto him, If  thou wilt be perfect, go [and] sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the yong man heard that saying, he went away sorowfull: for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say unto you, It is  easier for a  camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whe his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amased, saying, Who then can be saued?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Iesus behelde them, and sayde vnto them, With men this is vnpossible, but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then answered Peter, and said to him, Beholde, we haue forsaken all, and followed thee: what therefore shall we haue?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the  regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And whosoeuer shal forsake houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my Names sake, he shall receiue an hundreth folde more, and shall inherite euerlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last [shall be] first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
