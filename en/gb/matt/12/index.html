That they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said vnto the, What man shall there be among you, that hath a sheepe, & if it fal on a Sabbath day into a pit, doth not take it & lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much more then is a man better then a sheepe? Therefore, it is lawfull to doe well on a Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand; he stretched it foorth, and it was made whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But whe Iesus knew it, he departed thece, & great multitudes folowed him, & he healed the al,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And charged them in threatning wise, that they should not make him knowen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew  judgment to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall not striue, nor crie, neither shall any man heare his voyce in the streetes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he  send forth judgment unto victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his Name shall the Gentiles trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the people were amased, and saide, Is not this that sonne of Dauid?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the Pharises heard it, they saide, This man casteth the deuils no otherwise out, but through Beelzebub the prince of deuils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if Satan cast out Satan, he is deuided against himself: how shal then his kingdom endure?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Also if I through Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your children cast them out?

Euen so shall it be with this wicked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he yet talked to the people, behold, [his] mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then one said vnto him, Beholde, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speake with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he answered, and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? & who are my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whosoeuer shall doe my Fathers will which is in heauen, the same is my brother and sister and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
