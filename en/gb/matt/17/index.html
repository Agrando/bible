Howe long nowe shall I suffer you! Bring him hither to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Iesus rebuked the deuill, and he went out of him: and the childe was healed at that houre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Iesus said vnto them, Because of your vnbeliefe: for verely I say vnto you, if ye haue faith as much as is a graine of mustarde seede, ye shall say vnto this mountaine, Remooue hence to yonder place, and it shall remoue: and nothing shalbe vnpossible vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by  prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall kill him, but the thirde day shall he rise againe: and they were very sorie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute [money] came to Peter, and said, Doth  not your master  pay  tribute?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own  children, or of strangers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter sayd vnto him, Of strangers. Then said Iesus vnto him, Then are the children free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a  piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
