If a man haue an hundreth sheepe, and one of them be gone astray, doeth he not leaue ninetie & nine, & go into the mountaines, and seeke that which is gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if so be that he finde it, verely I say vnto you, he reioyceth more of that sheepe, then of the ninetie and nine which went not astray:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So is it not ye wil of your Father which is in heauen, that one of these litle ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against  thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he will not hear [thee, then] take with thee one or two more, that in the  mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be  established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he shall  neglect to hear them, tell [it] unto the  church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as  an heathen man and a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verely I say vnto you, Whatsoeuer ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer ye loose on earth, shalbe loosed in heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall  agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the mids of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Iesus said vnto him, I say not to thee, Vnto seuen times, but, Vnto seuentie times seuen times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thereefore is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto a certaine King, which would take an account of his seruants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him  ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And because he had nothing to pay, his Lord commanded him to be solde, and his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and the dette to be payed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The servant therefore fell down, and  worshipped him, saying, Lord,  have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then that seruants Lord had compassion, and loosed him, and forgaue him the dette.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when the seruant was departed, hee found one of his felow seruants, which ought him an hundred pence, & he layde hands on him, and thratled him, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then his fellow seruant fell downe at his feete, and besought him, saying, Refraine thine anger towards me, and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yet he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the dette.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when his other felowe seruants sawe what was done, they were very sory, & came, and declared vnto their Lord all that was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his Lord called him vnto him, and sayd to him, O euil seruant, I forgaue thee all that dette, because thou prayedst me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oughtest not thou also to haue had pitie on thy fellowe seruant, euen as I had pitie on thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So his Lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormentours, till he should pay all that was due to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So likewise shall mine heauenly Father doe vnto you, except ye forgiue from your hearts, eche one to his brother their trespasses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
