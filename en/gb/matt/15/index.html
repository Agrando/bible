Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none  effect by your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[Ye] hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people draweth neere vnto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is farre off from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vaine they worship me, teaching for doctrines, mens precepts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man, but that which commeth out of the mouth, that defileth the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then came his disciples, and saide vnto him, Perceiuest thou not, that the Pharises are offended in hearing this saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But hee answered and saide, Euery plant which mine heauenly Father hath not planted, shalbe rooted vp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone, they be the blinde leaders of the blinde: and if the blinde leade ye blinde, both shall fall into the ditche.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then answered Peter, and said to him, Declare vnto vs this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said Iesus, Are ye yet without vnderstanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Perceiue ye not yet, that whatsoeuer entreth into the mouth, goeth into the bellie, and is cast out into the draught?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those thinges which proceede out of the mouth, come from the heart, and they defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart come euil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slaunders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things, which defile the man: but to eat with vnwashen hands, defileth not ye man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the  coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, behold, a woman of  Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, [thou] Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the  house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet she came, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, helpe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he answered, and said, It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to whelps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the whelpes eate of the crommes, which fall from their masters table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou desirest; her daughter was made whole at that houre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them [those that were] lame, blind, dumb,  maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In so much that the multitude wondered, to see the dumme speake, the maimed whole, the halt to goe, and the blinde to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they  continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his disciples saide vnto him, Whence should we get so much bread in the wildernes, as should suffice so great a multitude!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Iesus said vnto them, How many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen, & a few litle fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he commanded the multitude to  sit down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And tooke the seuen loaues, and the fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake them, and gaue to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven  baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they that had eaten, were foure thousand men, beside women, and litle children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Iesus sent away the multitude, and tooke ship, and came into the partes of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
