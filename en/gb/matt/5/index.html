A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither doe men light a candel, and put it vnder a bushel, but on a candlesticke, and it giueth light vnto all that are in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but  to fulfil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly I say vnto you, Till heauen, and earth perish, one iote or one title of the Law shall not scape, till all things be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the  least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say vnto you, except your righteousnes exceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharises, ye shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be  in danger  of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the  council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of  hell  fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the  altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Leaue there thine offring before the altar, and goe thy way: first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast  paid the uttermost farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if thy  right eye  offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Also if thy right hand make thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for better it is for thee that one of thy members perish, then that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It hath bene sayd also, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, let him giue her a bill of diuorcement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say vnto you, whosoeuer shall put away his wife (except it be for fornication) causeth her to commit adulterie: & whosoeuer shal marrie her that is diuorced, committeth adulterie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Nor yet by the earth: for it is his footestoole: neither by Hierusalem: for it is the citie of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Neither shalt thou sweare by thine head, because thou canst not make one heare white or blacke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your communication be,  Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of  evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say vnto you, Resist not euill: but whosoeuer shall smite thee on thy right cheeke, turne to him the other also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if any man wil sue thee at the law, and take away thy coate, let him haue thy cloke also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whosoeuer will compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Giue to him that asketh, and from him that would borowe of thee, turne not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Ye haue heard that it hath bin said, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, and hate your enemie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say vnto you, Loue your enemies: blesse them that curse you: doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which hurt you, and persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if ye loue them, which loue you, what rewarde shall you haue? Doe not the Publicanes euen the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others]? do not even the  publicans so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Ye shall therefore be perfit, as your Father which is in heauen, is perfite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
