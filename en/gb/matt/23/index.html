for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in [yourselves], neither suffer ye them that are  entering to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and  for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and  land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Woe unto you, [ye] blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he  is a debtor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Ye] fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that  sanctifieth the gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And whosoeuer sweareth by the altar, it is nothing: but whosoeuer sweareth by the offering that is vpon it, offendeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye fooles and blinde, whether is greater, the offering, or the altar which sanctifieth the offering?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whosoeuer therefore sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whosoeuer sweareth by the Temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the  throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier [matters] of the law, judgment, mercy, and  faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye blinde guides, which straine out a gnat, and swallowe a camell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou blinde Pharise, cleanse first the inside of the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be cleane also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye are like vnto whited tombes, which appeare beautifull outward, but are within full of dead mens bones, and all filthines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So are ye also: for outwarde ye appeare righteous vnto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisie and iniquitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And say, If we had bene in the dayes of our fathers, we would not haue bene partners with them in the blood of the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then ye be witnesses vnto your selues, that ye are the children of them that murthered the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O serpents, the generation of vipers, howe should ye escape the damnation of hell!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and [some] of them ye shall kill and crucify; and [some] of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute [them] from city to city:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of  Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Verely I say vnto you, all these things shall come vpon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [thou] that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have  gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under [her] wings, and ye would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Beholde, your habitation shalbe left vnto you desolate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I say vnto you, ye shall not see mee henceforth till that ye say, Blessed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
