Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when thou doest thine almes, let not thy left hand knowe what thy right hand doeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That thine almes may be in secret, and thy Father that seeth in secret, hee will rewarde thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber and when thou hast shut thy doore, pray vnto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall rewarde thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when ye pray, use not  vain repetitions, as the heathen [do]: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be ye not like them therefore: for your Father knoweth whereof ye haue neede, before ye aske of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done euen in earth, as it is in heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us this day our  daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgiue vs our dettes, as we also forgiue our detters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from  evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if ye do not forgiue men their trespasses,, no more will your father forgiue you your trespaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they  disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That thou seeme not vnto men to fast, but vnto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret, will rewarde thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But lay vp treasures for your selues in heauen, where neither the mothe nor canker corrupteth, & where theeues neither digge through, nor steale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine  eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if thine eye be wicked, then all thy body shalbe darke. Wherefore if the light that is in thee, be darkenes, howe great is that darkenesse?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No man can serve  two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and  mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold the fowls of the  air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Which of you by  taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they  toil not, neither do they spin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet I say vnto you, that euen Solomon in all his glorie was not arayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Wherefore if God so clothe the grasse of the fielde which is to day, and to morowe is cast into the ouen, shall he not doe much more vnto you, O ye of litle faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eate? or what shall we drinke? or where with shall we be clothed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(For after all these things seeke the Gentiles) for your heauenly Father knoweth, that ye haue neede of all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seeke ye first the kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these things shall be ministred vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Care not then for the morowe: for the morowe shall care for it selfe: the day hath ynough with his owne griefe.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
