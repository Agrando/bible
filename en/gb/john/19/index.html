Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify [him]: for I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Iewes answered him, We haue a lawe, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himselfe the Sonne of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And went againe into the common hall, and saide vnto Iesus, Whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him none answere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then saide Pilate vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, & haue power to loose thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were giuen thee from aboue: therefore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the greater sinne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From thence foorth Pilate sought to loose him, but the Iewes cried, saying, If thou deliuer him, thou art not Cesars friende: for whosoeuer maketh himselfe a King, speaketh against Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew,  Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was the Preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and hee sayde vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate sayde vnto them, Shall I crucifie your King? The high Priestes answered, We haue no King but Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led [him] away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he bare his owne crosse, and came into a place named of dead mens Skulles, which is called in Hebrewe, «Golgotha»:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Iesus in the middes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This title then read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified, was neere to the citie: and it was written in Hebrewe, Greeke and Latine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then saide the hie Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Iewes, but that he sayd, I am King of the Iewes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, What I haue written, I haue written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore they sayde one to another, Let vs not deuide it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. This was that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which sayth, They parted my garments among them, and on my coate did cast lots. So the souldiers did these things in deede.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Iesus sawe his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loued, he said vnto his mother, Woman, beholde thy sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then saide he to the disciple, Beholde thy mother: and from that houre, the disciple tooke her home vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there was set a  vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nowe when Iesus had receiued of the vineger, he saide, It is finished, and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then came the souldiers and brake the legges of the first, and of the other, which was crucified with Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead alreadie, they brake not his legges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers with a spear  pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he that sawe it, bare recorde, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might beleeue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things were done, that the Scripture shoulde be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shalbe broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And againe an other Scripture saith, They shall see him whom they haue thrust through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And there came also Nicodemus (which first came to Iesus by night) & brought of myrrhe and aloes mingled together about an hundreth pound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then tooke they the body of Iesus, and wrapped it in linnen clothes with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was  never man yet laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There then laide they Iesus, because of the Iewes Preparation day, for the sepulchre was neere.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
