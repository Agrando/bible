Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast  no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, not my feete onely, but also the hands and the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Iesus sayd to him, He that is washed, needeth not, saue to wash his feete, but is cleane euery whit: and ye are cleane, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For hee knewe who should betray him: therefore sayd he, Ye are not all cleane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So after he had washed their feete, and had taken his garments, and was set downe againe, he sayd vnto them, Knowe ye what I haue done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye call me Master, and Lorde, and ye say well: for so am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then your Lorde, and Master, haue washed your feete, ye also ought to wash one an others feete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I haue giuen you an example, that ye should doe, euen as I haue done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Verely, verely I say vnto you, The seruant is not greater then his master, neither the ambassadour greater then he that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If ye know these things, blessed are ye, if ye doe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From henceforth tell I you before it come, that when it is come to passe, ye might beleeue that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verely, verely I say vnto you, If I send any, he that receiueth him, receiueth me, and hee that receiueth me, receiueth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and  testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was  leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>To him beckened therefore Simon Peter, that he should aske who it was of whom he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He then, as he leaned on Iesus breast, saide vnto him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Iesus answered, He it is, to whome I shall giue a soppe, when I haue dipt it: and hee wet a soppe, and gaue it to Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the soppe, Satan entred into him. Then sayd Iesus vnto him, That thou doest, doe quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But none of them that were at table, knew, for what cause he spake it vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some of them thought because Iudas had the bag, that Iesus had sayd vnto him, Buy those things that we haue neede of against ye feast: or that he should giue some thing to the poore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Assoone then as he had receiued the soppe, he went immediately out, and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said,  Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorifie him in himselfe, and shal straightway glorifie him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A newe commaundement giue I vnto you, that ye loue one another: as I haue loued you, that ye also loue one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all men knowe that ye are my disciples, if ye haue loue one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, why can I not followe thee now? I will lay downe my life for thy sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Iesus answered him, Wilt thou lay downe thy life for my sake? Verely, verely I say vnto thee, The cocke shall not crowe, till thou haue denied me thrise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
