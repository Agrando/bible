If thou doest these things, shewe thy selfe to the worlde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For neither did his  brethren believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world can not hate you: but me it hateth, because I testifie of it, that the workes thereof are euill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go ye vp vnto this feast: I wil not go vp yet vnto this feast: for my time is not yet fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These things he sayde vnto them, and abode still in Galile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Iewes sought him at the feast, and saide, Where is hee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And much murmuring was there of him among the people. Some said, He is a good man: other sayd, Nay: but he deceiueth the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Howbeit no man spake  openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the  midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Iewes marueiled, saving, Howe knoweth this man the Scriptures, seeing that hee neuer learned!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them, and said,  My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man will doe his will, he shall knowe of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speake of my selfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered, and said, Thou hast a deuil: who goeth about to kill thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses therefore gaue vnto you circumcision, (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers) & ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the  law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not  according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And beholde, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him: doe the rulers know in deede that this is in deede that Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I knowe him: for I am of him, and he hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now many of the people beleeued in him, and said, When that Christ commeth, will he doe moe miracles then this man hath done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then saide Iesus vnto them, Yet am I a little while with you, and then goe I vnto him that sent mee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye shall seeke me, and shall not finde me, and where I am, can ye not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the  dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What saying is this that hee saide, Ye shall seeke mee, and shall not finde mee? and where I am, cannot ye come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the  last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believeth on me, as the  scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the  Holy Ghost was not yet [given]; because that Jesus was not yet  glorified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Other saide, This is that Christ: and some said, But shall that Christ come out of Galile?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saith not the Scripture that that Christ shall come of the seede of Dauid, and out of the towne of Beth-leem, where Dauid was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So was there dissension among the people for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them would haue taken him, but no man layde handes on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, Neuer man spake like this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then answered them the Pharises, Are yee also deceiued?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this people, which know not the Law, are cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus said vnto them, ( he that came to Iesus by night, and was one of them.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know  what he doeth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered, and said vnto him, Art thou also of Galile? Searche and looke: for out of Galile ariseth no Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And every man went unto his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
