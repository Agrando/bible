They said vnto him, Lord, come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Iesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then saide the Iewes, Beholde, how he loued him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And some of them saide, Coulde not he, which opened the eyes of the blinde, haue made also, that this man should not haue died?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Iesus therefore againe groned in himselfe, and came to the graue; it was a caue, and a stone was layde vpon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Iesus saide, Take ye away the stone. Martha the sister of him that was dead, said vnto him, Lorde, he stinketh alreadie: for he hath bene dead foure dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Iesus saide vnto her, Saide I not vnto thee, that if thou diddest beleeue, thou shouldest see the glorie of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they tooke away the stone from the place where the dead was layde; Iesus lift vp his eyes, and saide, Father, I thanke thee, because thou hast heard me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I knowe that thou hearest me alwayes, but because of the people that stand by, I said it, that they may beleeue, that thou hast sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>As hee had spoken these things, hee cried with a loude voyce, Lazarus, come foorth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he that was dead, came forth, bound hande and foote with bandes, and his face was bound with a napkin. Iesus said vnto them, Loose him, and let him goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then many of the Iewes, which came to Mary, and had seene the thinges, which Iesus did, beleeued in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a  council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him thus alone, all [men] will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and  take away both our place and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And one of them, [named] Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nor yet doe you consider that it is expedient for vs, that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that  were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then from that day foorth they consulted together, to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the Iewes Passeouer was at hande, and many went out of the countrey vp to Hierusalem before the Passeouer, to purifie themselues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then sought they for Iesus, and spake among themselues, as they stoode in the Temple, What thinke ye, that he cometh not to the feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Nowe both the hie Priestes and the Pharises had giuen a commaundement, that if any man knew where he were, he should shewe it, that they might take him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
