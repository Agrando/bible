even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Father  judgeth  no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because that all men shoulde honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father: he that honoureth not the Sonne, the same honoureth not the Father, which hath sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father hath life in himselfe, so likewise hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himselfe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And hath given him  authority to execute judgment also, because he is  the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And shall come  forth; they that have done good, unto the  resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can  of mine own self do nothing:  as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not  true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another that beareth witnesse of me, and I know that the witnesse, which he beareth of me, is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I receiue not the record of man: neuerthelesse these things I say, that ye might be saued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for  a season to rejoice in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I haue greater witnesse then the witnesse of Iohn: for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finish, the same workes that I doe, beare witnesse of me, that the Father sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father himselfe, which hath sent me, beareth witnesse of me. Ye haue not heard his voyce at any time, neither haue ye seene his shape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And his worde haue you not abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye beleeued not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Searche the Scriptures: for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which testifie of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But ye will not come to me, that ye might haue life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I receiue not the prayse of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you, that ye have not the  love of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receiue me not: if another shall come in his owne name, him will ye receiue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of another, and seeke not the honour that commeth of God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] that accuseth you, [even] Moses, in whom ye trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For had ye beleeued Moses, ye would haue beleeued me: for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if ye beleeue not his writings, how shal ye beleeue my wordes?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
