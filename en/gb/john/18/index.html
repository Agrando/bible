Iesus sayde vnto them, I am hee. Nowe Iudas also which betraied him, stoode with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Assoone then as hee had saide vnto them, I am hee, they went away backewardes, and fell to the grounde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he asked them againe, Whome seeke yee? And they sayd, Iesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered, I have told you that I am [he]: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This was that the worde might be fulfilled which hee spake, Of them which thou gauest me, haue I lost none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter, Put vp thy sworde into the sheath: shall I not drinke of the cuppe which my Father hath giuen me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the bande and the captaine, and the officers of the Iewes tooke Iesus, and bound him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Caiaphas was he, that gaue counsel to the Iewes, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter stood at the doore without. Then went out the other disciple which was knowen vnto the hie Priest, and spake to her that kept the doore, and brought in Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then saide the maide that kept the doore, vnto Peter, Art not thou also one of this mans disciples? He sayd, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the seruants and officers stoode there, which had made a fire of coles: for it was colde, & they warmed themselues; Peter also stood among them, and warmed himselfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Iesus answered him, I spake openly to the world: I euer taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iewes resort continually, and in secret haue I sayde nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why askest thou mee? aske them which heard mee what I sayde vnto them: beholde, they knowe what I sayd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he had spoken these thinges, one of the officers which stoode by, smote Iesus with his rod, saying, Answerest thou the hie Priest so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Iesus answered him, If I haue euill spoken, beare witnes of the euil: but if I haue well spoken, why smitest thou me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nowe Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the hie Priest)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also [one] of his disciples? He denied [it], and said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the seruaunts of the hie Priest, his cousin whose eare Peter smote off, saide, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter then denied againe, and immediatly the cocke crewe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then led they Jesus from  Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pilate then went out vnto them, and said, What accusation bring yee against this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered, and saide vnto him, If hee were not an euill doer, we woulde not haue deliuered him vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him,  It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,  signifying what death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Pilate entred into the common hall againe, and called Iesus, and sayde vnto him, Art thou the king of the Iewes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Iesus answered him, Saiest thou that of thy selfe, or did other tell it thee of me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered, Am I a Iewe? Thine owne nation, and the hie Priestes haue deliuered thee vnto me. What hast thou done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate then said vnto him, Art thou a King then? Iesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King: for this cause am I borne, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should beare witnes vnto the trueth: euery one that is of the trueth, heareth my voyce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate saith unto him,  What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault [at all].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you haue a custome, that I shoulde deliuer you one loose at the Passeouer: will yee then that I loose vnto you the King of ye Iewes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then  cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
