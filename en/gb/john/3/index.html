can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Iesus answered, Verely, verely I say vnto thee, except that a man be borne of water and of the Spirite, hee can not enter into the kingdome of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is born of the flesh is  flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Marueile not that I said to thee, Yee must be borne againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind bloweth where it  listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Iesus answered, & saide vnto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our  witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If when I tel you earthly things, ye beleeue not, howe should yee beleeue, if I shall tel you of heauenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no  man  hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even]  the Son of man which  is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as Moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse, so must that Sonne of man be lift vp,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shoulde not perish, but haue eternall life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth  in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God sent not his Son into the world  to condemn the world; but that the  world through him might be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hee that beleeueth in him, is not condemned: but hee that beleeueth not, is condemned already, because he hath not beleeued in the Name of that onely begotten Sonne of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the  condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For euery man that euill doeth, hateth the light, neither commeth to light, least his deedes should be reprooued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he that  doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought  in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things, came Iesus & his disciples into the lande of Iudea, and there taried with them, and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Iohn also baptized in Enon besides Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Iohn was not yet cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then there arose a question between [some] of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came vnto Iohn, and saide vnto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Iorden, to whom thou barest witnesse, behold, he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, A man  can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yee your selues are my witnesses, that I sayde, I am not that Christ, but that I am sent before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that hath the bride, is the bridegrome: but the friend of the bridegrome which standeth and heareth him, reioyceth greatly, because of the bridegromes voyce.
