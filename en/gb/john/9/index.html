He went his way therefore, and washed, and came againe seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, This is he: and other sayd, He is like him: but he himselfe sayd, I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes  opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, and sayd, The man that is called Iesus, made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and sayde vnto me, Goe to the poole of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and receiued sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they sayd vnto him, Where is he? He sayd, I can not tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought to the Pharises him that was once blinde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was the Sabbath day, when Iesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then againe the Pharises also asked him, how he had receiued sight; hee sayd vnto them, He layd clay vpon mine eyes, & I washed, and doe see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then spake they vnto the blinde againe, What sayest thou of him, because he hath opened thine eyes? And he sayd, He is a Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Iewes did not beleeue him (that he had bene blinde, and receiued his sight) vntill they had called the parents of him that had receiued sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they asked them, saying, Is this your sonne, whom ye say was borne blinde? How doeth he nowe see then?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered them, and sayd, We know that this is our sonne, & that he was borne blinde:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But by what meanes hee nowe seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, can we not tell: he is olde ynough: aske him: hee shall answere for himselfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These wordes spake his parents, because they feared the Iewes: for the Iewes had ordeined already, that if any man did confesse that he was Christ, he should be excommunicate out of the Synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore sayde his parents, Hee is olde ynough: aske him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,  Give God the praise: we know that this man is a  sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he answered, and sayd, Whether hee be a sinner or no, I can not tell: one thing I know, that I was blinde, and nowe I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then sayd they to him againe, What did he to thee? howe opened he thine eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Hee answered them, I haue tolde you already, and yee haue not heard it: wherefore would yee heare it againe? will yee also be his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spake with Moses: but this man we know not from whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered, and sayde vnto them, Doutlesse, this is a marueilous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him heareth he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Since the world began, was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blinde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not of God, hee could haue done nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said unto him,  Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered, and sayd, Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeue in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Iesus sayd vnto him, Both thou hast seene him, and he it is that talketh with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he sayd, Lord, I beleeue, and worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, For  judgment I am come into this world, that they  which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And some of the Pharises which were with him, heard these things, & sayd vnto him, Are we blinde also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Iesus sayd vnto them, If ye were blinde, ye should not haue sinne: but nowe ye say, We see: therefore your sinne remaineth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
