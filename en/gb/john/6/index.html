(Nowe there was much grasse in that place.) Then the men sate downe in nomber, about fiue thousande.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Iesus tooke the bread, & gaue thanks, & gaue to the disciples, and the disciples, to them that were set downe: and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they were satisfied, he said vnto his disciples, Gather vp the broken meat which remaineth, that nothing be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they gathered it together, and filled twelue baskets with the broken meat of the fiue barly loaues, which remained vnto them that had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the men, when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did, saide, This is of a trueth that Prophet that should come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when even was [now] come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And entered into a ship, and went over the sea  toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Sea arose with a great winde that blewe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they had rowed about fiue and twentie, or thirtie furlongs, they sawe Iesus walking on the sea, and drawing neere vnto the ship: so they were afraide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said vnto them, It is I: be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they  willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The day following, the people which stoode on the other side of the sea, saw that there was none other ship there, saue that one, whereinto his disciples were entred, and that Iesus went not with his disciples in the ship, but that his disciples were gone alone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And that there came other ships from Tiberias neere vnto the place where they ate the bread, after the Lord had giuen thankes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nowe when the people sawe that Iesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also tooke shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had founde him on the other side of the sea, they sayde vnto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father  sealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the  works of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said unto them,  This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers did eate Manna in the desart, as it is written, Hee gaue them bread from heauen to eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not  that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the breade of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen, and giueth life vnto the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then they said vnto him, Lorde, euermore giue vs this bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread  of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I said vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and beleeue not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine  own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this is the Fathers will which hath sent mee, that of all which hee hath giuen mee, I should lose nothing, but shoulde raise it vp againe at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which  seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said, Is not this Iesus that sonne of Ioseph, whose father and mother wee knowe? Howe then sayth he, I came downe from heauen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Iesus then answered, and saide vnto them, Murmure not among your selues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No man can come to mee, except the Father, which hath sent mee, drawe him: and I will raise him vp at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the  prophets, And they shall be all  taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that any man hath seen the Father,  save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Verely, verely I say vnto you, hee that beleeueth in me, hath euerlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am that bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse, and are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the  living bread which came down from heaven: if any man  eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have  no life in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Whosoeuer eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raise him vp at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is meat in deede, & my blood is drinke in deede.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Hee that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As  the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the  Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is that bread which came downe from heauen: not as your fathers haue eaten Manna, and are deade. Hee that eateth of this bread, shall liue for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>These things spake he in the Synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard [this], said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Iesus knowing in himselfe, that his disciples murmured at this, saide vnto them, Doeth this offend you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>What then if yee should see that Sonne of man ascend vp where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the  spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, [they] are spirit, and [they] are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you that beleeue not: for Iesus knewe from the beginning, which they were that beleeued not, & who shoulde betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And hee saide, Therefore saide I vnto you, that no man can come vnto mee, except it be giuen vnto him of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From that [time] many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then sayde Iesus to the twelue, Will yee also goe away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Then Simon Peter answered him, Master, to whome shall we goe? thou hast the wordes of eternall life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And we beleeue and knowe that thou art that Christ that Sonne of the liuing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Now he spake it of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon: for hee it was that shoulde betraie him, though he was one of the twelue.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
