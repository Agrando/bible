But Iesus stouped downe, & with his finger wrote on the groud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And againe hee stouped downe, and wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when they heard it, being accused by their owne conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at ye eldest euen to the last: so Iesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the mids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said, No man, Lord; Iesus said, Neither do I condemne thee: go and sinne no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said unto him,  Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said unto them,  Though I bear record of myself, [yet] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye judge after the flesh; I  judge no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if I also iudge, my iudgement is true: for I am not alone, but I, and the Father, that sent mee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it is also written in your Lawe, that the testimonie of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words spake Jesus in the  treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him;  for his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said the Iewes, Will he kill himselfe, because he saith, Whither I goe, can ye not come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And hee saide vnto them, Ye are from beneath, I am from aboue: ye are of this world, I am not of this worlde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said therefore vnto you, That ye shall die in your sinnes: for except ye beleeue, that I am he, ye shall die in your sinnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even  [the same] that I said unto you from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said Iesus vnto them, When ye haue lift vp the Sonne of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I doe nothing of my selfe, but as my Father hath taught me, so I speake these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone, because I do alwayes those things that please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As hee spake these thinges, many beleeued in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall  make you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, We be  Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Iesus answered them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, that whosoeuer committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer: but the Sonne abideth for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If that Sonne therefore shal make you free, ye shalbe free in deede.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speake that which I haue seene with my Father: and ye doe that which ye haue seene with your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered, and saide vnto him, Abraham is our father. Iesus said vnto them, If ye were Abrahams children, ye woulde doe the workes of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But nowe ye goe about to kill mee, a man that haue told you the trueth, which I haue heard of God: this did not Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Ye do the workes of your father. Then said they to him, We are not borne of fornication: we haue one Father, which is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore Iesus sayde vnto them, If God were your Father, then woulde ye loue mee: for I proceeded foorth, and came from God, neither came I of my selfe, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do ye not understand my  speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the  beginning, and  abode not in the  truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his  own: for he is a liar, and the  father of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And because I tell you the trueth, yee beleeue me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He that is of God, heareth Gods wordes: yee therefore heare them not, because ye are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Iesus answered, I haue not a deuil, but I honour my Father, and ye haue dishonoured me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one  that seeketh and judgeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never  see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which is dead? and the Prophets are dead: whome makest thou thy selfe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is  nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham  rejoiced to see my  day: and he  saw [it], and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then sayd ye Iewes vnto him, Thou art not yet fiftie yeere olde, & hast thou seene Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I  am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
