They said vnto him, We also will goe with thee. They went their way & entred into a ship straightway, and that night caught they nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when the morning was nowe come, Iesus stoode on the shore: neuerthelesse the disciples knewe not that it was Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Iesus then said vnto them, Syrs, haue ye any meate? They answered him, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he said vnto them, Cast out the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall finde. So they cast out, & they were not able at all to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt [his] fisher's  coat [unto him], (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the other disciples came by shippe (for they were not farre from land, but about two hundreth cubites) and they drewe the net with fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Assoone then as they were come to land, they sawe hoate coales, and fish laide thereon, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Iesus saide vnto them, Bring of the fishes, which ye haue nowe caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter stepped foorth and drewe the net to land, full of great fishes, an hundreth, fiftie and three: and albeit there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Iesus saide vnto them, Come, and dine; none of the disciples durst aske him, Who art thou? seeing they knewe that he was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Iesus then came and tooke bread, and gaue them, and fish likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is now the third time that Iesus shewed himselfe to his disciples, after that he was risen againe from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to him againe the second time, Simon the sonne of Iona, louest thou me? He said vnto him, Yea Lorde, thou knowest that I loue thee. He said vnto him, Feede my sheepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He saith unto him the  third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou  girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall  gird thee, and carry [thee] whither thou wouldest  not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This spake he, signifying by  what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Peter therefore sawe him, he saide to Iesus, Lord, what shall this man doe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Iesus said vnto him, If I will that he tarie till I come, what is it to thee? followe thou me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then went this worde abroade among the brethren, that this disciple shoulde not die. Yet Iesus saide not to him, He shall not die: but if I will that he tarie till I come, what is it to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nowe there are also many other things which Iesus did, the which if they should be written euery one, I suppose the world coulde not conteine the bookes that shoulde be written, Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
