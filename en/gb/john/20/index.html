She saith unto them, Because they have taken away  my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She supposing that he had bene the gardener, said vnto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Iesus saith vnto her, Marie. She turned her selfe, and said vnto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my  brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto  my Father, and your Father; and [to] my God, and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Marie Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seene the Lord, and that he had spoken these things vnto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of the week, when the  doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he had so saide, he shewed vnto them his handes, and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they had seene the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then saide Iesus to them againe, Peace be vnto you: as my Father sent me, so sende I you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had saide that, he breathed on them, and saide vnto them, Receiue the holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; [and] whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples therefore saide vnto him, We haue seene the Lord: but he said vnto them, Except I see in his handes the print of the nailes, and put my finger into the print of the nailes, and put mine hand into his side, I will not beleeue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And eight dayes after, againe his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Iesus, when the doores were shut, and stood in the middes, and said, Peace be vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After saide he to Thomas, Put thy finger here, and see mine hands, & put forth thine hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but faithfull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Thomas answered, & said vnto him, Thou art my Lord, and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But these things are written, that ye might beleeue, that Iesus is that Christ that Sonne of God, and that in beleeuing ye might haue life through his Name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
