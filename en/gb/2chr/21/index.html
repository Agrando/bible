The same time [also] did  Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit  fornication, and compelled Judah [thereto].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there came a writing to him from  Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, & hast made Iudah & the inhabitantes of Ierusalem to go a whoring, as the house of Ahab went a whoring, & hast also slaine thy brethre of thy fathers house, which were better then thou,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Beholde, with a great plague will the Lord smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wiues, and all thy substance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou [shalt have] great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until  thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that [were] near the  Ethiopians:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save  Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after all this, the Lorde smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in processe of time, euen after the end of two yeeres, his guttes fell out with his disease: so he dyed of sore diseases: & his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years,  and departed without being desired.
