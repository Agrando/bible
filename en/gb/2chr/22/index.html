So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Forty and two years old [was] Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned  one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also [was] Athaliah the daughter  of Omri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He walked also in the wayes of the house of Ahab: for his mother counselled him to doe wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his  counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he walked after their counsel, & went with Iehoram the sonne of Ahab King of Israel to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead: and the Aramites smote Ioram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned to be healed in Izreel, because of the woundes wherewith they had wounded him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael King of Aram. Nowe Azariah the sonne of Iehoram King of Iudah went downe to see Iehoram the sonne of Ahab at Izreel, because hee was diseased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the destruction of Ahaziah  was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore when Iehu executed iudgemet vpon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Iudah and the sonnes of the brethren of Ahaziah that waited on Ahaziah, he slew them also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he [is] the son of  Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and  destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Iehoshabeath the daughter of ye King, tooke Ioash the sonne of Ahaziah, and stale him from among the Kings sonnes, that shoulde be slayne, & put him & his nource in the bed chamber: so Iehoshabeath the daughter of King Iehoram the wife of Iehoiada the Priest (for shee was the sister of Ahaziah) hid him from Athaliah: so she slew him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he was with them hid in the  house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the  land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
