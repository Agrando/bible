And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he [himself laid siege]  against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that [were] at Jerusalem, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus saith Saneherib the King of Asshur, Wherein doe ye trust, that ye will remaine in Ierusalem, during the siege?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Doeth not Hezekiah entice you to giue ouer your selues vnto death by famine and by thirst, saying, The Lorde our God shall deliuer vs out of the hande of the King of Asshur?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his  altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Knowe ye not what I and my fathers haue done vnto all the people of other countreyes? Were the gods of the nations of other landes able to deliuer their land out of mine hande?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who [was there] among all the  gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of  mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And his servants spake yet [more] against the LORD God, and against his  servant Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He wrote also letters, blaspheming the Lorde God of Israel and speaking against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other countreies could not deliuer their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliuer his people out of mine hande.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they  cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that [were] on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, [which were] the  work of the hands of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And for this [cause] Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz,  prayed and cried to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and  captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his  own bowels slew him there with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the Lorde saued Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem from the hande of Saneherib King of Asshur, and from the hande of all other, and maintained them on euery side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was  magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him  a sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit [done] unto him; for his heart  was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled him selfe (after that his heart was lifted vp) he and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and the wrath of the Lorde came not vpon them in the dayes of Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Hezekiah also had exceeding much riches and honour, and he gate him treasures of siluer, and of golde, and of precious stones, and of sweete odours, and of shieldes, and of all pleasant vessels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And of store houses for the increase of wheat and wine & oyle, and stalles for all beasts, and rowes for the stables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he made him cities, and had possession of sheepe and oxen in abundance: for God had giuen him substance exceeding much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of  Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Howbeit in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was [done] in the land, God left him, to  try him, that he might know all [that was] in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Concerning the rest of the actes of Hezekiah, and his goodnesse, beholde, they are written in the vision of Ishiah the Prophet, the sonne of Amoz, in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in the highest sepulchre of the sonnes of Dauid: and all Iudah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem did him honour at his death: and Manasseh his sonne reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
