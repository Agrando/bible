And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to  give thee much more than this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Amaziah separated them, to wit, the armie that was come to him out of Ephraim, to returne to their place: wherefore their wrath was kindled greatly against Iudah, and they returned to their places with great anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of  Seir ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And [other] ten thousand [left] alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the  rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the soldiers of the  army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up [to be] his gods, and  bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not  deliver their own people out of thine hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that  [the king] said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be  smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come,  let us see one another in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Ioash King of Israel sent to Amaziah King of Iudah, saying, The thistle that is in Lebanon, sent to the cedar that is in Lebanon, saying, Giue thy daughter to my sonne to wife: and the wilde beast that was in Lebanon went and trode downe the thistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou thinkest: lo, thou hast smitten Edom, and thine heart lifteth thee vp to bragge: abide now at home: why doest thou prouoke to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, and Iudah with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Amaziah would not hear; for  it [came] of God, that he might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they sought after the gods of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Ioash the King of Israel went vp: and he, and Amaziah King of Iudah saw one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which is in Iudah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Iudah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled euery man to his tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Ioash the King of Israel tooke Amaziah King of Iudah, the sonne of Ioash, the sonne of Iehoahaz in Bethshemesh, and brought him to Ierusalem, and brake downe the wall of Ierusalem, from the gate of Ephraim vnto the corner gate, foure hundreth cubites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And [he took] all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with  Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Amaziah the sonne of Ioash King of Iudah liued after the death of Ioash sonne of Iehoahaz King of Israel, fifteene yeere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Concerning the rest of the actes of Amaziah first and last, are they not written in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nowe after the time that Amaziah did turne away from ye Lord, they wrought treason against him in Ierusalem: and when he was fled to Lachish, they sent to Lachish after him, and slewe him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they brought him vpon horses, & buried him with his fathers in the citie of Iudah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
