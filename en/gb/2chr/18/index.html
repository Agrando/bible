And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that [he had] with him, and persuaded him to go up [with him] to  Ramothgilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Ahab King of Israel saide vnto Iehoshaphat King of Iudah, Wilt thou goe with mee to Ramoth Gilead? And hee answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people, and wee will ioyne with thee in the warre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the  word of the LORD to day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of  prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver [it] into the king's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Iehoshaphat sayde, Is there heere neuer a Prophet more of the Lorde that wee might inquire of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I  hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same [is] Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say  so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the King of Israel called an eunuche, & said, Call quickly Michaiah the sonne of Imla.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in [their]  robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him  horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the Prophets prophesied so, saying, Go vp to Ramoth Gilead, & prosper: for the Lord shall deliuer it into the hand of the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one  assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Michaiah saide, As the Lorde liueth, whatsoeuer my God saith, that will I speake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said,  Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the King sayd to him, Howe oft shall I charge thee, that thou tell mee nothing but the trueth in the Name of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said,  These have no master; let them return [therefore] every man to his house in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the King of Israel sayde to Iehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee, that he would not prophesie good vnto me, but euill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the  host of heaven standing on his right hand and [on] his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Lorde sayd, Who shall perswade Ahab King of Israel, that he may go vp, and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And one spake and said thus, and another said that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then there came forth a spirit and stoode before the Lord, and said, I will perswade him; the Lord said vnto him, Wherein?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And  [the LORD] said, Thou shalt entice [him], and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do [even] so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a  lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the  cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Michaiah saide, Behold, thou shalt see that day when thou shalt goe from chamber to chamber to hide thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the King of Israel sayde, Take ye Michaiah, and cary him to Amon the gouernour of the citie, and to Ioash the Kings sonne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with bread of  affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Michaiah said, If thou returne in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me; he saide, Heare, all ye people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the King of Israel and Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah went vp to Ramoth Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will  disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the King of Aram had commaunded the captaines of the charets that were with him, saying, Fight you not with small, nor great, but against the King of Israel onely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It [is] the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat  cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them [to depart] from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For when the captaines of the charets saw that hee was not the King of Israel, they turned backe from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then a certaine man drewe a bowe mightily, and smote the King of Israel betweene the ioyntes of his brigandine: Therefore he saide to his charetman, Turne thine hand, and carie mee out of the host: for I am hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel  stayed [himself] up in [his] chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
