because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Zichri a mighty man of Ephraim slew Maaseiah the Kings sonne, and Azrikam the gouernour of the house, and Elkanah the second after the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren  two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name [was] Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold,  because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage [that] reacheth up unto heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: [but are there] not with you, even with you,  sins against the LORD your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nowe therefore heare me, and deliuer the captiues againe, which ye haue taken prisoners of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the Lord is toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then certain of the heads of the children of  Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have  offended against the LORD [already], ye intend to add [more] to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and [there is] fierce wrath against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the armie left the captiues & the spoyle before the princes and all the Congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men which were  expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and  anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their  brethren: then they returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time did king Ahaz send unto the  kings of Assyria to help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(For the Edomites came moreouer, & slew of Iudah, and caryed away captiues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistims also inuaded the cities in the low countrey, & toward the South of Iudah, and tooke Bethshemesh, and Aialon, and Gederoth and Shocho, with the villages thereof, and Timnah, with her villages, and Gimzo, with her villages, and they dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of  Israel;
