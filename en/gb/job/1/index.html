Thus did Job  continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there was a day when the  sons of God came to present themselves  before the LORD, and Satan  came also among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence  comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said,  From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Lord saide vnto Satan, Hast thou not considered my seruant Iob, how none is like him in the earth? an vpright and iust man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for  nought?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hast not thou made  an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth thine hand now, and  touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to  thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath [is] in  thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the  presence of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And on a day, when his sonnes and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There came a messenger vnto Iob, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding in their places,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the  Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The  fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And whiles he was yet speaking, another came, and sayd, The Caldeans set on three bands, and fell vpon the camels, and haue taken them, and haue slayne the seruantes with the edge of the sworde: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy  sons and thy daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And behold, there came a great wind from beyonde the wildernesse, and smote the foure corners of the house, which fel vpon the children, and they are dead, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, and  rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return  thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away;  blessed be the name of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God  foolishly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
