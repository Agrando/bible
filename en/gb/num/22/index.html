And Balak the son of Zippor [was] king of the Moabites at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which [is] by the  river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Come now therefore, I pray thee, and curse me this people (for they are stronger then I) so it may be that I shall be able to smite them, and to driue them out of the land: for I knowe that hee, whome thou blessest, is blessed, and he whom thou cursest, shall be cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with  the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and  the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then God came vnto Balaam, and sayde, What men are these with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Baalam said vnto God, Balak ye sonne of Zippor, king of Moab hath set vnto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt and couereth the face of the earth: come nowe, curse them for my sake: so it may be that I shalbe able to ouercome them in battell, and to driue them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God  said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they [are] blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give  me leave to go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the princes of Moab rose vp, and went vnto Balak, & sayd, Balaam hath refused to come with vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Balak yet sent againe moe princes, and more honourable then they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor,  Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I wil promote thee vnto great honour, and wil do whatsoeuer thou sayest vnto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Balaam answered, and sayde vnto the seruants of Balak, If Balak woulde giue me his house full of siluer and golde, I can not goe beyonde the worde of the Lorde my God, to doe lesse or more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me  more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God came vnto Balaam by night, and sayd vnto him, If the men come to call thee, rise vp, and goe with them: but onely what thing I say vnto thee, that shalt thou doe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Balaam rose vp early, and sadled his asse, and went with the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God's anger was kindled because he  went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when the asse saw the Angel of the Lord stand in the way, and his sworde drawen in his hand, the asse turned out of the way and went into the field, but Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when the asse sawe the Angel of the Lord, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, and dasht Balaams foote against the wall: wherefore hee smote her againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the Angel of the Lord went further, & stoode in a narowe place, where was no way to turne, either to the right hand, or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the asse sawe the Angell of the Lorde, she lay downe vnder Balaam: therefore Balaam was very wroth, and smote the asse with a staffe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the LORD  opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Balaam saide vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked me: I woulde there were a sworde in mine hand, for nowe would I kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever  since [I was] thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the LORD  opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy]  way is perverse before me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the asse sawe me, and turned fro me now three times: for els, if she had not turned fro me, surely I had euen nowe slaine thee, and saued her aliue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Balaam saide vnto the Angel of the Lorde, I haue sinned: for I wist not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore if it displease thee, I will turne home againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the  word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which [is] in the  border of Arnon, which [is] in the utmost coast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Balak saide vnto Balaam, Did I not sende for thee to call thee? Wherefore camest thou not vnto me? am I not able in deede to promote thee vnto honour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say  any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So Balaam went with Balak, & they came vnto the citie of Huzoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then Balak offred bullockes, and sheepe, and sent thereof to Balaam, & to the princes that were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of  Baal, that thence he might see the utmost [part] of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
