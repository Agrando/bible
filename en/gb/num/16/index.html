that he be not as  Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But on the morowe all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses & against Aaron, saying, Ye haue killed the people of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, then they turned their faces toward the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and beholde, the cloude couered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Moses and Aaron were come before the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Get you vp from among this Congregation: for I wil consume them quickly: then they fell vpon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the  altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the  plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he stood between the dead and the living;
