Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light  over against the candlestick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Aaron did so, lighting the lampes thereof towarde ye forefront of the Candlesticke, as the Lorde had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And this work of the candlestick [was of] beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, [was] beaten work:  according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Take the Leuites from among the children of Israel, and purifie them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle  water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and [so] make themselves clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they shal take a yong bullocke with his meate offring of fine floure, mingled with oyle, and another yong bullocke shalt thou take for a sinne offring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the  whole assembly of the children of Israel together:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the  children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Aaron shall offer the Leuites before the Lord, as a shake offring of ye childre of Israel, that they may execute the seruice of the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Leuites shall put their handes vpon the heades of the bullockes, and make thou the one a sinne offring, and the other a burnt offring vnto the Lorde, that thou mayest make an atonement for the Leuites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thou shalt set the Leuites before Aaron and before his sonnes, & offer the as a shake offring to the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus thou shalt separate the Leuites from among the children of Israel, and the Leuites shal be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And afterwarde shall the Leuites goe in, to serue in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou shalt purifie them and offer them, as a shake offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For they are freely giuen vnto me from among the children of Israel, for such as open any wombe: for all the first borne of the children of Israel haue I taken them vnto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For all the first borne of the children of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast: since the day that I smote euery first borne in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for my selfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I haue taken the Leuites for all the first borne of the children of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I have given the Levites [as] a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the  children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the  sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Moses and Aaron and all the Cogregation of the children of Israel did with the Leuites, according vnto all that the Lorde had commanded Moses concerning the Leuites: so did the children of Israel vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the Leuites were purified, and washed their clothes, and Aaron offred them as a shake offring before the Lord, and Aaron made an atonement for them, to purifie them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation  before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This also belongeth to the Leuites: from fiue and twentie yeere olde and vpwarde, they shall goe in, to execute their office in the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the  service [thereof], and shall serve no more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But shall minister  with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
