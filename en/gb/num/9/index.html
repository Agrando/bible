Moses in the wildernes of Sinai, in the first moneth of the second yeere, after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The children of Israel shall also celebrate the Passeouer at ye time appointed thereunto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to  all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Moses spake vnto the children of Israel, to celebrate the Passeouer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they kept the Passeouer in the fouretenth day of the first moneth at euen in the wildernesse of Sinai: according to all that the Lord had comanded Moses, so did ye children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there were certain men, who were defiled  by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And those men said unto him, We [are] defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not  offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Moses saide vnto them, Stande still, and I will heare what the Lorde will commande concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or [be] in a journey afar off, yet  he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The fourteenth day of the  second month at even they shall keep it, [and] eat it with unleavened bread and bitter [herbs].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall leaue none of it vnto the morning, nor breake any bone of it: according to all the ordinance of the Passeouer shall they keepe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the man that [is] clean, and is not in a  journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a stranger dwell among you, and wil keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord, as the ordinance of the Passeouer, & as the maner thereof is, so shall he do: ye shall haue one lawe both for the stranger, and for him that was borne in the same lande.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, [namely], the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the  appearance of fire, until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it was always: the cloude couered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when the cloude was taken vp from the Tabernacle, then afterwarde the children of Israel iourneyed: and in the place where the cloude abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the commandment of the  LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the  charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So when the cloud abode a few dayes vpon the Tabernacle, they abode in their tents according to the comandement of ye Lord: for they iourneyed at the commandement of the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And though the cloud abode vpo the Tabernacle from euen vnto the morning, yet if the cloude was taken vp in the morning, then they iourneyed: whether by daye or by night the cloude was taken vp, then they iourneyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Or if the cloude taryed two dayes or a moneth, or a yeere vpon the Tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel abode still, and iourneyed not: but when it was taken vp, they iourneyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the  hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
