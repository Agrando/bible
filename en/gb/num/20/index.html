Neither is there any water to drinke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Moses and Aaron went from the assemblie vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and fell vpon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take the  rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Moses tooke the rod from before the Lord, as he had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels;  must we fetch you water out of this rock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Moses lift vp his hande, and with his rod he smote the rocke twise, and the water came out aboundantly: so the Congregation, and their beastes dranke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to  sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This [is] the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he  was sanctified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of  Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>How our fathers went downe into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, where the Egyptians handled vs euill and our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when we cried vnto the Lord, he heard our voyce, and sent an Angel, and hath brought vs out of Egypt, and beholde, wee are in the citie Kadesh, in thine vtmost border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I pray thee that we may passe through thy countrey: we will not goe through the fieldes nor the vineyardes, neither will we drinke of the water of the welles: we will goe by the kings way, and neither turne vnto the right hand nor to the left, vntill we be past thy borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Edom answered him, Thou shalt not passe by mee, least I come out against thee with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the children of Israel said vnto him, We will goe vp by the hie way: and if I and my cattell drinke of thy water, I will then pay for it: I will onely (without any harme) goe through on my feete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Hee answered againe, Thou shalt not goe through. The Edom came out against him with much people, and with a mightie power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel  turned away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the children of Israel with al the Congregation departed from Kadesh, they came vnto the mount Hor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Lorde spake vnto Moses and to Aaron in the mount Hor neere the coast of the land of Edom, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Aaron shall be  gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Take Aaron and Eleazar his sonne, and bring them vp into the mount Hor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And cause Aaron to put off his garmentes and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: for Aaron shall be gathered to his fathers, and shall die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went vp into the mount Hor, in the sight of all the Congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses put off Aarons clothes, & put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: so Aaron dyed there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came downe from off the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When al the Congregation sawe that Aaron was dead, al the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirtie dayes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
