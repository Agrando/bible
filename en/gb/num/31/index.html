vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Reuenge the children of Israel of the Midianites, and afterwarde shalt thou be gathered vnto thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go  against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A thousande of euery tribe throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye sende to the warre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So there were taken out of the thousands of Israel, twelue thousande prepared vnto warre, of euery tribe a thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of [every] tribe, them and  Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they warred against Midian, as the Lorde had commaunded Moses, and slue all the males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; [namely], Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian:  Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the children of Israel tooke the women of Midian prisoners, and their children, and spoyled all their cattell, and all their flockes, and all their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they burnt all their cities, wherein they dwelt, and all their villages with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they tooke all the spoyle and all the pray both of men and beastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the  captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which [are] by Jordan [near] Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Moses and Eleazar the Priest, and all the princes of the Congregation went out of the campe to meete them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses was angry with the captaines of the hoste, with the captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer hundreds, which came from the warre and battel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the  women alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD  in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore kill every male among the  little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But all the women children that haue not knowen carnall copulation, keepe aliue for your selues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ye shal remaine without the host seuen dayes, all that haue killed any person, and all that haue touched any dead, and purifie both your selues and your prisoners the third day and the seuenth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also ye shall purifie euery garment and all that is made of skins & al worke of goates heare, and all things made of wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Eleazar ye Priest sayd vnto the men of warre, which went to the battel, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lorde commanded Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As for gold, and siluer, brasse, yron, tynne, and lead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make [it] go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be  purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the  water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye shal wash also your clothes the seuenth day, and ye shalbe cleane: and afterward ye shal come into the Hoste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Take the summe of the praie that was taken, both of

of the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take  one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the bootie, to wit, the rest of the praie which the men of warre had spoyled, was sixe hundreth seuentie and fiue thousand sheepe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And seuentie and two thousand beeues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And three score and one thousand asses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And two and thirtie thousande persons in all, of women that had lyen by no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the halfe, to wit, the part of them that went out to warre touching the nomber of sheepe, was three hundreth seuen and thirtie thousand, and fiue hundreth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the  LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the beeues were six & thirty thousad, whereof the Lordes tribute was seuentie & two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the asses were thirtie thousande and fiue hundreth, whereof the Lordes tribute was three score and one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And  the persons [were] sixteen thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute [was] thirty and two persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Moses gaue the tribute of the Lordes offring vnto Eleazar the Priest, as the Lorde had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And of the children of Israel's  half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>(For the halfe that perteined vnto the Congregation, was three hundreth thirtie and seuen thousand sheepe and fiue hundreth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And sixe and thirtie thousand beeues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And thirtie thousand asses, & fiue hudreth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And sixteene thousande persons)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Even of the  children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, [both] of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the captaines which were ouer thousandes of the hoste, the captaines ouer the thousandes, and the captaines ouer the hundreds came vnto Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And saide to Moses, Thy seruants haue taken the summe of the men of warre which are vnder our authoritie, and there lacketh not one man of vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Moses and Eleazar the Priest tooke the golde of them, and all wrought iewels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all the golde of the offring that they offered vp to the Lorde (of the captaines ouer thousands and hundreds) was sixteene thousande seuen hundreth and fiftie shekels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>([For] the men of war had taken spoil, every man for  himself.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, [for] a  memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
