yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Are not fiue sparowes bought for two farthings, and yet not one of them is forgotten before God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yea, and all the heares of your head are nombred: feare not therefore: yee are more of value then many sparowes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But hee that shall denie mee before men, shall be denied before the Angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whosoeuer shall speake a woorde against the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but vnto him, that shal blaspheme ye holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and [unto] magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the holy Ghost shall teache you in the same houre, what yee ought to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said vnto him, Man, who made me a iudge, or a deuider ouer you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of  covetousness: for a man's life  consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The  ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he  thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, This wil I do, I wil pul downe my barnes, and builde greater, and therein will I gather all my fruites, and my goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and]  be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said vnto him, O foole, this night wil they fetch away thy soule fro thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast prouided?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So [is] he that layeth up treasure  for himself, and is not rich toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The life is more then meate: and the body more then the raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the rauens: for they neither sowe nor reape: which neither haue storehouse nor barne, & yet God feedeth them: how much more are yee better then foules?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you with taking thought, can adde to his stature one cubite?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If yee then bee not able to doe the least thing, why take yee thought for the remnant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies howe they growe: they labour not, neither spin they: yet I say vnto you, that Solomon himselfe in all his royaltie was not clothed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If then God so clothe the grasse which is to day in the field, and to morowe is cast into the ouen, howe much more will he clothe you, O yee of litle faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither  be ye of doubtful mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all such things the people of the world seeke for: and your Father knoweth that ye haue neede of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell that ye have, and give  alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there will your hearts be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your loins be girded about, and [your] lights burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And ye your selues like vnto men that waite for their master, when he will returne from the wedding, that when he commeth and knocketh, they may open vnto him immediatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed are those seruants, whom the Lord when he commeth shall finde waking: verely I say vnto you, he will girde himselfe about, and make them to sit downe at table, and will come forth, and serue them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if he come in the seconde watch, or come in the third watch, and shall finde them so, blessed are those seruants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nowe vnderstand this, that if the good man of the house had knowen at what houre the theefe would haue come, he would haue watched, and would not haue suffered his house to be digged through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Peter saide vnto him, Master, tellest thou this parable vnto vs, or euen to all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom [his] lord shall make ruler over his household, to give [them their]  portion of meat in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed is that seruant, whom his master when he commeth, shall finde so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Of a trueth I say vnto you, that he wil make him ruler ouer all that he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that seruant say in his heart, My master doeth deferre his comming, and ginne to smite the seruants, and maydens, and to eate, and drinke, and to be drunken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The master of that seruant will come in a day when he thinketh not, and at an houre when he is not ware of, and will cut him off, and giue him his portion with the vnbeleeuers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that seruant that knewe his masters will, and prepared not himselfe, neither did according to his will, shalbe beaten with many stripes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few [stripes]. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask  the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Notwithstanding I must be baptized with a baptisme, & how am I grieued, till it be ended?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Thinke ye that I am come to giue peace on earth? I tell you, nay, but rather debate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from hencefoorth there shall be fiue in one house deuided, three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The father shalbe deuided against ye sonne, and the sonne against the father: the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother: the mother in lawe against her daughter in lawe, and the daughter in lawe against her mother in lawe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud  rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when ye see the South winde blowe, ye say, that it wilbe hoate: & it commeth to passe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Hypocrites, ye can discerne the face of the earth, and of the skie: but why discerne ye not this time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, [as thou art] in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the  officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast payed the vtmost mite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
