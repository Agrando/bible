Or whereto shall I compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And againe he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdome of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like leauen, which a woman tooke, and hid in three peckes of floure, till all was leauened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then saide one vnto him, Lorde, are there fewe that shalbe saued?
