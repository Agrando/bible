Then Iesus sayde vnto Simon, Feare not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had brought the ships to land, they forsooke all, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on [his] face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he stretched forth his hand, & touched him, saying, I will, be thou cleane; immediately the leprosie departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he commaunded him that hee should tell it no man: but Go, sayth he, and shew thy selfe to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing, as Moses hath commanded, for a witnes vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he kept himselfe apart in the wildernes, and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord  was [present] to heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then beholde, men brought a man lying in a bed, which was taken with a palsie, and they sought meanes to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they could not finde by what way they might bring him in, because of the preasse, they went vp on the house, and let him downe through the tyling, bed and all, in the middes before Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he sawe their faith, he sayd vnto him, Man, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the Scribes & the Pharises began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? who can forgiue sinnes, but God onely?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when Iesus perceiued their reasoning, he answered, and sayd vnto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whether is easier to say, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, or to say, Rise and walke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that ye may know that that Sonne of man hath authoritie to forgiue sinnes in earth, (he sayd vnto the sicke of the palsie) I say to thee, Arise: take vp thy bed, and goe to thine house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediatly he rose vp before them, and tooke vp his bed whereon he lay, and departed to his owne house, praysing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were all amased, & praysed God, and were filled with feare, saying, Doutlesse we haue seene strange things to day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he left all, rose vp, and folowed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Leui made him a great feast in his owne house, where there was a great company of Publicanes, and of other that sate at table with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But they that were Scribes and Pharises among them, murmured against his disciples, saying, Why eate ye and drinke ye with Publicanes and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, They that are whole, neede not the Physician, but they that are sicke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise [the disciples] of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the dayes will come, euen when the bridegrome shalbe taken away from them: then shall they fast in those dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Againe he spake also vnto them a parable, No man putteth a piece of a newe garment into an olde vesture: for then the newe renteth it, and the piece taken out of the newe, agreeth not with the olde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also no man powreth newe wine into olde vessels: for then ye new wine wil breake the vessels, and it will runne out, and the vessels will perish:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But newe wine must be powred into newe vessels: so both are preserued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Also no man that drinketh olde wine, straightway desireth newe: for he sayth, The olde is more profitable.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
