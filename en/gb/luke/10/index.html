Go not from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you,  eat such things as are set before you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And heale the sicke that are there, and say vnto them, The kingdome of God is come neere vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Euen the very dust, which cleaueth on vs of your citie, we wipe off against you: notwithstanding knowe this, that the kingdome of God was come neere vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I say to you, that it shall be easier in that day for them of Sodom, then for that citie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe be to thee, Chorazin: woe be to thee, Beth-saida: for if the miracles had bene done in Tyrus and Sidon, which haue bene done in you, they had a great while agone repented, sitting in sackecloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore it shall be easier for Tyrus, and Sidon, at the iudgement, then for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heauen, shalt be thrust downe to hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that despiseth you, despiseth me: and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us  through thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning  fall from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means  hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Neuerthelesse, in this reioyce not, that the spirits are subdued vnto you: but rather reioyce, because your names are written in heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the  wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and [he] to whom the Son will reveal [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he turned him unto [his] disciples, and said privately, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that ye see:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you that many Prophets and Kings haue desired to see those things, which ye see, and haue not seene them: and to heare those things which ye heare, and haue not heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, behold,  a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he saide vnto him, What is written in the Lawe? Howe readest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he answered, and saide, Thou shalt loue thy Lord God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, and with all thy thought, and thy neighbour as thy selfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he said vnto him, Thou hast answered right: this doe, and thou shalt liue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, willing  to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Iesus answered, and saide, A certaine man went downe from Hierusalem to Iericho, and fell among theeues, and they robbed him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leauing him halfe dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Nowe so it fell out, that there came downe a certaine Priest that same way, and when he sawe him, he passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And likewise also a Leuite, when he was come neere to the place, went and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then a certaine Samaritane, as he iourneyed, came neere vnto him, and when he sawe him, he had compassion on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And went to him, & bound vp his wounds, and powred in oyle and wine, and put him on his owne beast, and brought him to an Inne, and made prouision for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on the morowe when he departed, he tooke out two pence, and gaue them to the hoste, and said vnto him, Take care of him, and whatsoeuer thou spendest more, when I come againe, I will recompense thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Which nowe of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour vnto him that fell among the theeues?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he saide, He that shewed mercie on him. Then said Iesus vnto him, Goe, and do thou likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And she had a sister called Marie, which also sate at Iesus feete, and heard his preaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was combred about much seruing, and came to him, and saide, Master, doest thou not care that my sister hath left me to serue alone? bid her therefore, that she helpe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Iesus answered, and said vnto her, Martha, Martha, thou carest, and art troubled about many things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But one thing is needefull, Marie hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
