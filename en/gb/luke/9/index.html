And he desired to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a  desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when the people knewe it, they followed him: and he receiued them, and spake vnto them of the kingdome of God, and healed them that had neede to be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the day began to weare away, the twelue came, and sayd vnto him, Sende the people away, that they may goe into the townes and villages round about, and lodge, & get meate: for we are here in a desart place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes;  except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they were about fiue thousand men. Then he sayde to his disciples, Cause them to sit downe by fifties in a company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they did so, and caused all to sit downe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven,  he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they did all eate, and were satisfied: and there was taken vp of that remained to them, twelue baskets full of broken meate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, as he was  alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They answered, and sayd, Iohn Baptist: and others say, Elias: and some say, that one of the olde Prophets is risen againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he sayd vnto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answered, and sayd, That Christ of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he warned and commaunded them, that they should tell that to no man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross  daily, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For whosoeuer will saue his life, shal lose it: and whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall saue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For what auantageth it a man, if he win the whole worlde, and destroy himselfe, or lose himselfe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whosoeuer shall be ashamed of me, and of my wordes, of him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed, when hee shall come in his glorie, and in the glorie of the Father, and of the holy Angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I tell you of a suretie, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they haue seene the kingdome of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was changed, and his garment was white and glistered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And beholde, two men talked with him, which were Moses and Elias:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who appeared in glory, and spake of his  decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Peter & they that were with him, were heauie with sleepe, and when they awoke, they saw his glorie, and the two men standing with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to passe, as they departed fro him, Peter said vnto Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here: let vs therefore make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias, and wist not what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Whiles he thus spake, there came a cloude and ouershadowed them, and they feared when they were entring into the cloude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And there came a voyce out of the cloud, saying, This is that my beloued Sonne, heare him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept [it] close, and told no man in  those days any of those things which they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And beholde, a man of the companie cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, beholde my sonne: for he is all that I haue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and  bruising him hardly departeth from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Nowe I haue besought thy disciples to cast him out, but they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Iesus answered, & said, O generation faithlesse, and crooked, howe long now shall I be with you, and suffer you? bring thy sonne hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whiles he was yet comming, the deuill rent him, and tare him: and Iesus rebuked the vncleane spirite, and healed the childe, and deliuered him to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they vnderstood not that word: for it was hid from them, so that they could not perceiue it: and they feared to aske him of that worde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When Iesus sawe the thoughtes of their heartes, he tooke a litle childe, & set him by him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And said vnto them, Whosoeuer receiueth this litle childe in my Name, receiueth me: and whosoeuer shall receiue me, receiueth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, he shall be great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Iesus saide vnto him, Forbid ye him not: for he that is not against vs, is with vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly  set his face to go to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And sent messengers before him: and they went and entred into a towne of the Samaritans, to prepare him lodging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But they woulde not receiue him, because his behauiour was, as though he would go to Hierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when his disciples James and John saw [this], they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of  spirit ye are of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For the Sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them. Then they went to another towne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain [man] said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Iesus saide vnto him, The foxes haue holes, and the birdes of the heauen nestes, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury  their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Iesus saide vnto him, No man that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh backe, is apt to the kingdome of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
