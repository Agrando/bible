I trowe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as hee entred into a certaine towne, there met him tenne men that were lepers, which stoode a farre off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they lift vp their voyces and saide, Iesus, Master, haue mercie on vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he saw them, he said vnto them, Goe, shewe your selues vnto the Priestes; it came to passe, that as they went, they were clensed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then one of them, when hee sawe that hee, was healed, turned backe, and with a loude voyce praised God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fell downe on his face at his feete, and gaue him thankes: and he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Iesus answered, and said, Are there not tenne clensed? but where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is none founde that returned to giue God praise, saue this stranger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he saide vnto him, Arise, goe thy way, thy faith hath saued thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with  observation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is  within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see  one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after [them], nor follow [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightening that lighteneth out of the one part vnder heauen, shineth vnto the other part vnder heauen, so shall the Sonne of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first must he suffer many things, and be reprooued of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they dranke, they married wiues, and gaue in marriage vnto the day that Noe went into the Arke: and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise also, as it was in the dayes of Lot: they ate, they dranke, they bought, they solde, they planted, they built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heauen, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>After these ensamples shall it be in the day when the Sonne of man is reueiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lots wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall  preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, in that night there shall be two in one bed: the one shalbe receiued, and the other shalbe left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two women shalbe grinding together: the one shalbe taken, and the other shalbe left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Two shalbe in the fielde: one shalbe receiued, and another shalbe left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord?
