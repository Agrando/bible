For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not aboue his master: but whosoeuer will be a perfect disciple, shall bee as his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Either howe canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou seest not the beame that is in thine owne eye? Hypocrite, cast out the beame out of thine owne eye first, and then shalt thou see, perfectly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For euery tree is knowen by his owne fruite: for neither of thornes gather men figges, nor of bushes gather they grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth foorth good, and an euill man out of the euill treasure of his heart bringeth foorth euill: for of the aboundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I speake?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man which built an house, and digged deepe, and layde the fundation on a rocke: and when the waters arose, the flood beat vpon that house, and coulde not shake it: for it was grounded vpon a rocke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But hee that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that built an house vpon the earth without foundation, against which the flood did beate, and it fell by and by: and the fall of that house was great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
