And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And beholde, a woman in the citie, which was a sinner, when she knewe that Iesus sate at table in the Pharises house, shee brought a boxe of oyntment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And shee stoode at his feete behinde him weeping, and began to wash his feete with teares, and did wipe them with the heares of her head, and kissed his feete, and anoynted them with the oyntment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw [it], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him:  for she is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was a certaine lender which had two detters: the one ought fiue hundreth pence, and the other fiftie:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When they had nothing to pay, he forgaue them both: Which of them therefore, tell mee, will loue him most?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered, and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgaue most; he said vnto him, Thou hast truely iudged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he turned to the woman, and said vnto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entred into thine house, and thou gauest mee no water to my feete: but she hath washed my feete with teares, and wiped them with the heares of her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou gauest me no kisse: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kisse my feete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Mine head with oyle thou didest not anoint: but she hath anoynted my feete with oyntment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;  for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loveth little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he saide vnto her, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they that sate at table with him, began to say within themselues, Who is this that euen forgiueth sinnes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee;  go in peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
