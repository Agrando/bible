And when he had  opened the book, he found the place where it was written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Spirit of the Lorde is vpon mee, because he hath anoynted me, that I should preach the Gospel to the poore: he hath sent mee, that I should heale the broken hearted, that I should preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blinde, that I should set at libertie them that are bruised:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And that I should preache the acceptable yeere of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And hee closed the booke, and gaue it againe to the minister, and sate downe: and the eyes of all that were in the Synagogue were fastened on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he began to say vnto them, This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your eares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all  bare him witness, and  wondered at the  gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he said vnto them, Ye will surely say vnto mee this prouerbe, Physician, heale thy selfe: whatsoeuer we haue heard done in Capernaum, doe it here likewise in thine owne countrey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he saide, Verely I say vnto you, No Prophet is accepted in his owne countrey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the  land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But vnto none of them was Elias sent, saue into Sarepta, a citie of Sidon, vnto a certaine widowe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Also many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Eliseus the Prophet: yet none of them was made cleane, sauing Naaman the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And rose vp, and thrust him out of the citie, and led him vnto the edge of the hil, whereon their citie was built, to cast him downe headlong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he passed through the middes of them, and went his way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And came downe into Capernaum a citie of Galile, and there taught them on the Sabbath dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonied at his doctrine: for his worde was with authoritie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an vncleane deuill, which cryed with a loude voyce,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, [thou] Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him. Then the deuill throwing him in the middes of them, came out of him, and hurt him nothing at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So feare came on them all, and they spake among themselues, saying, What thing is this: for with authoritie and power he commaundeth the foule spirits, and they come out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And ye fame of him spred abroad throughout all the places of the countrey round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he stoode ouer her, and rebuked the feuer, and it left her, and immediatly she arose, and ministred vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now at the sunne setting, all they that had sicke folkes of diuers diseases, brought them vnto him, and he layd his hands on euery one of them, and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking [them] suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But he sayd vnto them, Surely I must also preach the kingdome of God to other cities: for therefore am I sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And hee preached in the Synagogues of Galile.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
