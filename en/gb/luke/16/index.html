Giue an accounts of thy stewardship: for thou maiest be no longer steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the stewarde saide within himselfe, What shall I doe? for my master taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot digge, and to begge I am ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I knowe what I will doe, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receiue mee into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then called he vnto him euery one of his masters detters, & said vnto the first, Howe much owest thou vnto my master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, An hudreth measures of oyle; he saide to him, Take thy writing, and sitte downe quickely, and write fiftie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And hee sayde, An hundreth measures of wheate. Then he saide to him, Take thy writing, and write foure score.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the lord commended  the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the  children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon  of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting  habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the  true [riches]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is  another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All these thinges heard the Pharises also which were couetous, and they scoffed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets [were] until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nowe it is more easie that heauen and earth shoulde passe away, then that one title of the Lawe should fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her  that is put away from [her] husband committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in  purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also there was a certaine begger named Lazarus, which was laide at his gate full of sores,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And desired to bee refreshed with the crommes that fell from the riche mans table: yea, and the dogges came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it was so that the begger died, and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome. The rich man also died, and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in hell  he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he cried, and saide, Father Abraham, haue mercie on mee, and sende Lazarus that hee may dippe the tip of his finger in water, & coole my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham saide, Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleasures, and likewise Lazarus paines: now therefore is he comforted, and thou art tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Besides all this, betweene you & vs there is a great gulfe set, so that they which would goe from hence to you, can not: neither ca they come from thence to vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>(For I haue fiue brethren) that he may testifie vnto them, least they also come into this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham said vnto him, They haue Moses and the Prophets: let them heare them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he sayde, Nay, father Abraham: but if one came vnto them from the dead, they will amend their liues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he saide vnto him, If they heare not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rise from the dead againe.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
