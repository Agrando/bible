Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Give us  day by day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And forgiue vs our sinnes: for euen we forgiue euery man that is indetted to vs: And leade vs not into temptation: but deliuer vs from euill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For a friende of mine is come out of the way to me, & I haue nothing to set before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And hee within shoulde answere, and say, Trouble mee not: the doore is nowe shut, and my children are with mee in bed: I can not rise and giue them to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his  importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say vnto you, Aske, and it shall be giuen you: seeke, and yee shall finde: knocke, and it shalbe opened vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: & to him that knocketh, it shalbe opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If a sonne shall aske bread of any of you that is a father, will he giue him a stone? Or if hee aske a fish, will he for a fish giue him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Or if hee aske an egge, will hee giue him a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If yee then which are euill, can giue good giftes vnto your children, howe much more shall your heauenly Father giue the holy Ghost to them, that desire him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then hee cast out a deuill which was domme: and when the deuill was gone out, the domme spake, and the people wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And others tempted him, seeking of him a signe from heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house [divided] against a house falleth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils  through Beelzebub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If I through Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whome doe your children cast them out? Therefore shall they be your iudges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I with the  finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When a strong man armed keepeth his  palace, his goods are in peace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when a stronger then hee, commeth vpon him, and ouercommeth him: hee taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and deuideth his spoiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then goeth hee, and taketh to him seuen other spirites worse then himselfe: and they enter in, and dwel there: so the last state of that man is worse then the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed [is] the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But hee saide, Yea, rather blessed are they that heare the woorde of God, and keepe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when the people were gathered thicke together, he began to say, This is a wicked generation: they seeke a signe, and there shall no signe be giuen them, but the signe of Ionas the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as Ionas was a signe to the Niniuites: so shall also the Sonne of man bee to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Queene of the South shall rise in iudgement, with the men of this generation, and shall condemne them: for shee came from the vtmost partes of the earth to heare the wisedome of Solomon, and beholde, a greater then Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Niniue shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for they repented at the preaching of Ionas: and beholde, a greater then Ionas is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth [it] in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The light of the bodie is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, then is thy whole bodie light: but if thine eye be euill, then thy bodie is darke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Take heede therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darkenesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore thy whole body shall be light, hauing no part darke, then shall all be light, euen as when a candle doth light thee with the brightnesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when the Pharise saw it, he marueiled that he had not first washed before dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the Lord saide to him, In deede yee Pharises make cleane the outside of the cuppe, and of the platter: but the inwarde part is full of rauening and wickednesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Ye fooles, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is within also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But rather give alms  of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye  tithe mint and rue and  all manner of herbs, and pass over  judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over [them] are not aware [of them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he sayde, Wo be to you also, yee Lawyers: for yee lade men with burdens grieuous to be borne, and yee your selues touche not the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Truly  ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they shall slay and  persecute:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>That the blood of all the prophets, which was  shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>From the blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias, which was slaine betweene the altar and the Temple: verely I say vnto you, it shall be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have  taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge [him] vehemently, and to  provoke him to speak of many things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Laying wait for him, and seeking to catche some thing of his mouth, whereby they might accuse him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
