Then he tooke him, and healed him, and let him goe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And answered them, saying, Which of you shall haue an asse, or an oxe fallen into a pit, & wil not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they could not answere him againe to those things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When thou shalt be bidden of any man to a wedding, set not thy selfe downe in the chiefest place, lest a more honourable man then thou, be bidden of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he that bade both him & thee, come, and say to thee, Giue this man roome, and thou then begin with shame to take the lowest roome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when thou art bidden, goe and sit downe in the lowest roome, that when he that bade thee, cometh, he may say vnto thee, Friende, sit vp hier: then shalt thou haue worship in the presence of them that sit at table with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For whosoeuer exalteth himselfe, shall be brought lowe, and he that humbleth himselfe, shal be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor [thy] rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when thou makest a feast, call ye poore, the maimed, the lame, and the blind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shalt be blessed, because they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the iust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nowe when one of them that sate at table, heard these things, he said vnto him, Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdome of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then saide he to him, A certaine man made a great supper, and bade many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And sent his seruant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come: for all things are nowe readie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they all with  one [consent] began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, I haue bought fiue yoke of oxen, and I goe to proue them: I pray thee, haue me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another said, I haue maried a wife, and therefore I can not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the  streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the seruaunt saide, Lorde, it is done as thou hast commaunded, and yet there is roome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the master sayd to the seruaunt, Goe out into the hie wayes, and hedges, and compell them to come in, that mine house may bee filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I say vnto you, that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any [man] come to me, and  hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you, intending to build a tower,  sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have [sufficient] to finish [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lest that after he hath laide the foundation, and is not able to performe it, all that behold it, begin to mocke him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Saying, This man began to builde, and was not able to make an end?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what King going to make warre against another King, sitteth not downe first, and taketh counsell, whether he be able with ten thousande, to meete him that commeth against him with twentie thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Or els while hee is yet a great way off, hee sendeth an ambassage, and desireth peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So likewise, whosoeuer hee be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Salt [is] good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is neither meete for the land, nor yet for the dunghill, but men cast it out.
