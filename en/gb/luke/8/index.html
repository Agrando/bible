And they launched forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But as they sailed he fell  asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and  they were filled [with water], and were in jeopardy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they went to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, Master, we perish; he arose, and rebuked the winde, and the waues of water: and they ceased, and it was calme.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he sayde vnto them, Where is your fayth? And they feared, & wondered among them selues, saying, Who is this that commandeth both the windes and water, and they obey him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So they sailed vnto the region of the Gadarenes, which is ouer against Galile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he sawe Iesus, he cryed out and fell downe before him, and with a loude voyce sayd, What haue I to doe with thee, Iesus the Sonne of God the most High? I beseech thee torment me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands,  and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Iesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he sayd, Legion, because many deuils were entred into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they besought him, that he would not commaund them to goe out into the deepe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there was there by, an hearde of many swine, feeding on an hill: and the deuils besought him, that he would suffer them to enter into them. So he suffered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then went the deuils out of the man, and entred into the swine: and the hearde was caried with violence from a steepe downe place into the lake, and was choked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When the heardmen sawe what was done, they fled: and when they were departed, they tolde it in the citie and in the countrey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they came out to see what was done, and came to Iesus, and found the man, out of whom the deuils were departed, sitting at the feete of Iesus, clothed, and in his right minde: and they were afrayd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They also which saw it, tolde them by what meanes he that was possessed with the deuill, was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the whole multitude of the countrey about the Gadarenes, besought him that he would depart from them: for they were taken with a great feare: and he went into the ship, and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then the man, out of whome the deuils were departed, besought him that hee might be with him: but Iesus sent him away, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published  throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people  [gladly] received him: for they were all waiting for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he had but a daughter onely, about twelue yeeres of age, and she lay a dying (and as he went, the people thronged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her  living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>When she came behind him, she touched the hemme of his garment, and immediatly her yssue of blood stanched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then Iesus sayd, Who is it that hath touched me? When euery man denied, Peter sayd and they that were with him, Master, the multitude thrust thee, and tread on thee, & sayest thou, Who hath touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Iesus sayde, Some one hath touched me: for I perceiue that vertue is gone out of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When the woman sawe that she was not hid, she came trembling, and fell downe before him, and tolde him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said vnto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath saued thee: go in peace.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he yet spake, there came one from the ruler of the Synagogues house, which sayde to him, Thy daughter is dead: disease not the Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>When Iesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Feare not: beleeue onely, and she shall be saued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And when he went into the house, he suffered no man to goe in with him, saue Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and the father and mother of the maide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all wept, and  bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they laught him to scorne, knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So he thrust them all out, and tooke her by the hand, and cryed, saying, Maide, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit came again, and she  arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then her parents were astonied: but hee commaunded them that they should tell no man what was done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
