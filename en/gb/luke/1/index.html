For I am an olde man, and my wife is of a great age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel,  that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And beholde, thou shalt be domme, & not be able to speake, vntill the day that these things be done, because thou beleeuedst not my words, which shalbe fulfilled in their season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now the people waited for Zacharias, and marueiled that he taried so long in the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when hee came out, hee coulde not speake vnto them: then they perceiued that hee had seene a vision in the Temple: For he made signes vnto them, and remained domme.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to passe, when the daies of his office were fulfilled, that he departed to his owne house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after those daies, his wife Elisabet conceiued, and hid her selfe fiue moneths, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus hath the Lorde dealt with me, in the daies wherein he looked on me, to take from me my rebuke among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the  house of David; and the virgin's name [was] Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, [thou that art]  highly favoured, the Lord [is] with thee:  blessed [art] thou among women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when she saw [him], she was  troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast  found favour with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For loe, thou shalt conceiue in thy wobe, and beare a sonne, and shalt call his name Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He shall be great, and shall be  called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And hee shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome shall bee none ende.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said Mary unto the angel,  How shall this be, seeing  I know not a man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost  shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that  holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be  called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, behold, thy  cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the  sixth month with her, who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For with God shall nothing be vnpossible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Marie said, Behold the seruant of the Lord: be it vnto me according to thy woorde. So the Angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the  hill country with haste, into a  city of Juda;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And entred into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe  leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed [art] thou among women, and  blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And whence commeth this to mee, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For loe, assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares, the babe sprang in my bellie for ioye,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed is shee that beleeued: for those things shall be perfourmed, which were tolde her from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirite reioyceth in God my Sauiour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For he hath  regarded the  low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because hee that is mightie, hath done for me great things, and holy is his Name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy [is] on them  that fear him from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He hath shewed strength with his  arm; he hath  scattered the proud in the  imagination of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He hath  put down the mighty from [their] seats, and exalted them of  low degree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He hath filled the  hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of [his] mercy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>As he  spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Marie abode with her about three moneths: after, shee returned to her owne house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbours, and cousins heard tell howe the Lorde had shewed his great mercie vpon her, and they reioyced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it was so that on the eight day they came to circumcise the babe, and called him Zacharias after the name of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But his mother answered, and saide, Not so, but he shalbe called Iohn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they saide vnto her, There is none of thy kindred, that is named with this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then they made signes to his father, howe he would haue him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>So hee asked for writing tables, and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn, and they marueiled all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake and praised God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all  these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all they that heard [them]  laid [them] up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the  hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel; for he hath  visited and  redeemed his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And hath raised up an  horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>As he spake by ye mouth of his holy Prophets, which were since the world began, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>That he would sende vs deliuerance fro our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate vs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>To perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and  to remember his holy covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And the othe which he sware to our father Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Which was, that he would graunt vnto vs, that we being deliuered out of the handes of our enemies, should serue him without feare,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>In holiness and righteousness  before him, all the days of our life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And thou,  child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>To  give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the  remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the  dayspring from on high hath visited us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>To give light to them that sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the  way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the childe grewe, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the wildernesse, til the day came that he should shewe him selfe vnto Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
