Is not he that sitteth at table? And I am among you as he that serueth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed vnto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That ye may eate, and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and sit on seates, and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired [to have] you, that he may  sift [you] as wheat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cocke shall not crowe this day, before thou hast thrise denied that thou knewest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he saide vnto them, When I sent you without bagge, and scrip, and shooes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take [it], and likewise [his] scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say vnto you, That yet the same which is written, must be perfourmed in me, Euen with the wicked was he nombred: for doubtlesse those things which are written of me, haue an ende.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, beholde, here are two swordes; he said vnto them, It is ynough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he came out, and went (as he was wont) to the mount of Oliues: and his disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, Father, if thou wilt, take away this cuppe from mee: neuerthelesse, not my will, but thine be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared an Angell vnto him from heauen, comforting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in an  agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great  drops of blood falling down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said vnto them, Why sleepe ye? rise and pray, least ye enter into tentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Iesus saide vnto him, Iudas, betrayest thou the Sonne of man with a kisse?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them smote a seruant of the hie Priest, and strooke off his right eare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then Iesus answered, and said, Suffer them thus farre: and he touched his eare, & healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the  power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then took they him, and led [him], and brought him into the high priest's house.  And Peter followed afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had kindled a fire in the middes of the hall, and were set downe together, Peter also sate downe among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a certaine mayde behelde him as hee sate by the fire, and hauing well looked on him, said, This man was also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while, another man sawe him, and saide, Thou art also of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And about the space of an houre after, a certaine other affirmed, saying. Verely euen this man was with him: for he is also a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter saide, Man, I knowe not what thou sayest; immediatly while hee yet spake, the cocke crewe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then the Lorde turned backe, and looked vpon Peter: and Peter remembred the worde of the Lord, how he had said vnto him, Before the cocke crowe, thou shalt denie me thrise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And when they had blindfolded him, they smote him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophecie who it is that smote thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other thinges blasphemously spake they against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Saying, Art thou that Christ? tell vs; he said vnto them, If I tell you, ye wil not beleeue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And if also I aske you, you will not answere me, nor let me goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Hereafter shall the Sonne of man sit at the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then sayd they all, Art thou then ye Sonne of God? And he sayd to them, Ye say, that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Then sayd they, What neede we any further witnes? for we our selues haue heard it of his owne mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
