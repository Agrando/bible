Olofernes commaunded all his armie and all his people, which were come to take his part, that they should remoue their camps against Bethulia, and that they shoulde take all the streites of the hill, and to make warre against the children of Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 Then their strong men remoued their camps in that day, and the armie of the men of warre was an hundreth thousand and seuentie footemen, and twelue thousande horsemen, beside the baggage & other men that were afoote among them, a very great multitude.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 And they camped in the plaine neere vnto Bethulia, by the fountaine, and they spred abroade towarde Dothaim vnto Belbaim, and in length from Bethulia vnto Ciamon, which is ouer against Esdraelom.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 Nowe the children of Israel, when they sawe the multitude, were greatly troubled, and said euery one to his neighbour, Nowe will they shut vp all the whole earth: for neither the hye mountaines nor the valleyes, nor the hilles are able to abide their burden.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 Then euery one tooke his weapons of warre, and burning fires in their towres, they remained and watched all that night.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 But in the seconde day, Olofernes brought foorth all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel, which were in Bethulia,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 And viewed the passages vp to their citie, & came to the fountaines of their waters, and tooke them and set garrisons of men of warre ouer them, and remoued towarde his people.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 Then came vnto him all the chiefe of ye children of Esau, & all the gouernours of the people of Moab, and all the captaines of the sea coast, & said,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 Let our captaine nowe heare a worde, least an inconuenience come in thine armie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 For this people of the children of Israel doe not trust in their speares, but in the height of the mountaines, wherein they dwell, because it is not easie to come vp to the tops of their mountaines.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 Nowe therefore, my lorde, fight not against them in battell aray, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 Remaine in thy campe, & keepe all the men of thine armie, and let thy men keepe still the water of the countrey, that commeth foorth at the foote of the mountaine.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 For al the inhabitants of Bethulia haue their water thereof: so shall thirst kill them, and they shall giue vp their citie: and we and our people wil goe vp to the toppes of the mountaines that are neere, and will campe vpon them, and watch that none goe out of the citie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 So they and their wiues, and their children shalbe consumed with famine, & before the sworde come against them, they shall be ouerthrowen in the streetes where they dwell.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 Thus shalt thou render them an euil reward, because they rebelled and obeyed not thy person peaceably.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 And these wordes pleased Olofernes and all his souldiers, and he appointed to doe as they had spoken.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 So the campe of the children of Ammon departed, & with the fiue thousande of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, & tooke ye waters, & the fountaines of ye waters of the children of Israel.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 Then the children of Esau went vp with the children of Ammon, & camped in the mountaines ouer against Dothaim, and they sent some of them selues toward the South, and toward the East, ouer against Rebel, which is neere vnto Chusi, that is vpon the riuer Mochmur: and the rest of the armie of the Assyrians camped in the fielde, and couered the whole lande: for their tents and their baggage were pitched in a wonderfull great place.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 Then the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lorde their God, because their heart fayled: for all their enemies had compassed them about, and there was no waye to escape out from among them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 Thus all the companie of Assur remained about them, both their footemen, chariots & horsemen, foure & thirtie dayes: so that euen all the places of their waters fayled all ye inhabitants of Bethulia.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 And the cisternes were emptie, and they had not water ynough to drinke for one day: for they gaue them to drinke by measure.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>{\cf2 Therefore their children swooned, and their wiues and yong men failed for thirst, & fell downe in the streetes of the citie, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no strength in them.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chiefe of the citie, both yong men and women, and children, and cryed with a loude voyce, and said before all the Elders,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>{\cf2 The Lord iudge betweene vs and you: for you haue done vs great iniurie, in that ye haue not required peace of the children of Assur.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>{\cf2 For now we haue no helper: but God hath sold vs into their hands, that we should be throwen downe before them with thirst & great destructio.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>{\cf2 Nowe therefore call them together, and deliuer the whole citie for a spoyle to the people of Olofernes, and to all his armie.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>{\cf2 For it is better for vs to be made a spoyle vnto them, then to die for thirst: for we will bee his seruants that we may liue, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wiues, nor our children to die.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>{\cf2 We take to witnesse against you the heauen and the earth, and our God and Lorde of our fathers, which punisheth vs, according to our sinnes and the sinnes of our fathers, that he lay not these things to our charge.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>{\cf2 Then there was a great cry of all with one consent in the middes of the assemblie, and they cryed vnto the Lord God with a loude voyce.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 Then said Ozias to the, Brethren, be of good courage: let vs waite yet fiue dayes, in the which space the Lorde our God may turne his mercie towarde vs: for he will not forsake vs in the ende.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 And if these dayes passe, and there come not helpe vnto vs, I will doe according to your worde.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 So he separated the people, euery one vnto their charge, and they went vnto the walles and towers of their citie, and sent their wiues and their children into their houses, and they were very lowe brought in the citie.}</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
