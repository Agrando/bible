Olophernes vnto her, Woman, bee of good comfort: feare not in thine heart: for I neuer hurt any that would serue Nabuchodonosor the King of all the earth.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 Now therefore if thy people that dwelleth in the mountaines, had not despysed me, I would not haue lifted vp my speare against them: but they haue procured these things to themselues.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and art come vnto vs: for thou art come for sauegard: bee of good comfort, thou shalt liuefrom this night, and hereafter.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 For none shall hurt thee, but intreate thee well, as they doe the seruants of King Nabuchodonosor my lorde.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 Then Iudeth saide vnto him, Receiue the wordes of thy seruant, and suffer thine handmaide to speake in thy presence, and I will declare no lye to my lorde this night.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 And if thou wilt followe the wordes of thine handmaid, God wil bring ye thing perfectly to passe by thee, and my lorde shall not faile of his purpose.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 As Nabuchodonosor King of all the earth liueth, and as his power is of force, who hath sent thee to reforme all persons, not onely men shalbe made subiect to him by thee, but also the beastes of the fieldes, and the cattel, and the foules of the heauen shall liue by thy power vnder Nabuchodonosor and all his house.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 For we haue heard of thy wisedome and of thy prudent spirite, and it is declared through the whole earth, that thou onely art excellent in all the kingdome, and of a wonderfull knowledge, and in feates of warre marueilous.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 Nowe as concerning the matter which Achier did speake in thy councill, we haue heard his wordes: for the men of Bethulia did take him, and he declared vnto them all that he had spoken vnto thee.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 Therefore, O lord and gouernour, reiect not his worde, but set it in thine heart, for it is true: for there is no punishment against our people, neither can the sworde preuaile against them, except they sinne against their God.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 Nowe therefore, least my lorde shoulde be frustrate, and voyde of his purpose, and that death may fall vpon them, and that they may be taken in their sinne whiles they prouoke their God to anger, which is so oft times as they doe that which is not beseeming,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 (For because their vitailes fayle, and all their water is wasted, they haue determined to take their cattell, and haue purposed to consume all things that God had forbidden them to eate by his Lawes:}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 Yea, they haue purposed to consume the first fruits of the wheat, and the tithes of the wine, & of the oyle which they had reserued and sanctified for the Priestes that serue in Ierusalem before the face of our God: the which things it is not lawfull for any of the people to touch with their handes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 Moreouer, they haue sent to Ierusalem, because they also that dwel there, haue done the like, such as should bring them licence from ye Senate)}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 Nowe when they shall bring them worde, they will doe it, and they shall be giuen thee to be destroyed the same day.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 Wherefore I thine handmaide, knowing all this, am fledde from their presence, and God hath sent me to worke a thing with thee, whereof all the earth shall wonder, and whosoeuer shall heare it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 For thy seruant feareth God, and worshippeth the God of heauen day and night, and nowe let me remaine with thee, my lord, and let thy seruant go out in the night into the valley, and I will pray vnto God, that he may reueile vnto me when they shall commit their sinnes,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 And I wil come and shew it vnto thee: then thou shalt goe foorth with all thine armie, and there shall be none of them that shall resist thee.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 And I will leade thee through the middes of Iudea, vntill thou come before Ierusalem, and I will set thy throne in the middes thereof, and thou shalt driue them as sheepe that haue no shepherd, and a dogge shall not barke with his mouth against thee: for these things haue bene spoken vnto me, and declared vnto me according to my foreknowledge, and I am sent to shewe thee.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 Then her wordes pleased Olofernes, and all his seruants, and they marueiled at her wisedom, and sayde,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 There is not such a woman in all the world, both for beautie of face, and wisedome of wordes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>{\cf2 Likewise Olofernes said vnto her, God hath done this, to sende thee before the people, that strength might be in our handes, and destruction vpon them that despise my lorde.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 And nowe thou art both beautifull in thy countenance, and wittie in thy wordes: surely if thou doe as thou hast spoken, thy God shall be my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of Nabuchodonosor, and shalt be renoumed throughout the whole earth.}</span>
