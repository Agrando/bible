the cleare firmament, the beautie of the heauen so glorious to beholde,}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>{\cf2 The sunne also, a marueilous instrument when it appeareth, declareth, at his going out, the worke of the most High.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 At noone it burneth the countrey, and who may abide for the heate thereof?}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 The sunne burneth the mountaines three times more then hee that keepeth a fornace with continuall heate: it casteth out the fierie vapours, and with the shining beames blindeth the eyes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 Great is the Lorde that made it, and by his commandement he causeth it to runne hastily.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 The moone also hath hee made to appeare according to her season, that it should be a declaration of the time, and a signe for the world.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 The feastes are appointed by the moone: the light thereof diminisheth vnto the ende.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>{\cf2 The moneth is called after the name thereof, and groweth wonderously in her changing.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>{\cf2 It is a campe pitched on high, shining in the firmament of heauen: the beautie of heauen are the glorious starres, and the ornament that shineth in the high places of the Lord.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>{\cf2 By the comandement of the Holy one they continue in their order, & faile not in their watch.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>{\cf2 Looke vpon the raine bowe, and prayse him that made it: very beautifull is it in the brightnes thereof.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>{\cf2 It compasseth the heauen about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most High haue bended it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>{\cf2 Through his commandement he maketh the snowe to haste, and sendeth swiftly the lightning of his iudgement.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>{\cf2 Therefore he openeth his treasures, and the cloudes flie forth as the foules.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>{\cf2 In his power hath he strengthened ye clouds, and broken the hailestones.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>{\cf2 The mountaines leape at the sight of him: the South winde bloweth according to his will.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>{\cf2 The sound of his thunder beateth the earth: so doeth the storme of the North: the whirlewinde also, as birds that flie, scattereth the snowe, and the falling downe thereof is as the grashoppers that light downe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>{\cf2 The eye marueileth at the beautie of the whitenes thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raine of it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>{\cf2 He also powreth out the frost vpon ye earth like salte, and when it is frosen, it sticketh on the tops of pales.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>{\cf2 When the colde North winde bloweth, an yce is frosen of the water, it abideth vpon all the gatherings together of water, and clotheth the waters as with a brestplate.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>{\cf2 It deuoureth the mountaines, & burneth the wildernes, & destroyeth that that is greene, like fire.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>{\cf2 The remedie of all these is when a cloude commeth hastily, and when a dewe commeth vpon the heate, it refresheth it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 By his worde he stilleth the winde: by his counsell he appeaseth the deepe, & planteth ylands therein.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>{\cf2 They that saile ouer the sea, tell of the perils thereof, and when we heare it with our eares, we marueile thereat.}</span> <span class="verse"><a

terrible, and very great, and marueilous is his power.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>{\cf2 Prayse the Lord, and magnifie him as much as ye can, yet doeth hee farre exceede: exalt him with all your power, and be not wearie, yet can ye not attaine vnto it.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>{\cf2 Who hath seene him, that he might tel vs? and who can magnifie him as he is?}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>{\cf2 For there are hid yet greater things then these be, & we haue seene but a fewe of his workes.}</span> <span class="verse"><a
