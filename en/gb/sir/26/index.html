trusting in ye great liberalitie of their nobility.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>{\cf2 An harlot is compared to a sowe: but the wife that is marryed, is counted as a towre against death to her husband.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>{\cf2 A wicked woman is giuen as a rewarde to a wicked man: but a godly woman is giuen to him that feareth the Lorde.}</span> <span
