that yee may be safe.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>{\cf2 For the Lorde wil haue the father honoured of the children, and hath confirmed the authoritie of the mother ouer the children.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>{\cf2 Who so honoureth his father, his sinnes shall be forgiuen him, and he shall absteine from them, and shall haue his daily desires.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>{\cf2 And hee that honoureth his mother, is like one that gathereth treasure.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>{\cf2 Who so honoureth his father, shall haue ioy of his owne children, and when he maketh his praier, he shalbe heard.}</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>{\cf2 Hee that honoureth his father, shall haue a long life, and hee that is
