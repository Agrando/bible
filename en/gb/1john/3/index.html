For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his  seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,  neither he that loveth not his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not as Cain, [who] was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.  And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Marueile not, my brethren, though this world hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We  know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not [his] brother abideth in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hereby perceive we the love [of God], because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whoso hath this  world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and  shutteth up his bowels [of compassion] from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And hereby we know that we are of the truth,  and shall assure our hearts before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For  if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, [then] have we confidence toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This is then his commaundement, That we beleeue in the Name of his Sonne Iesus Christ, and loue one another as hee gaue commaundement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.
