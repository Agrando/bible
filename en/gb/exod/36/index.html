And  they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So all the wise men, that wrought all the holy worke, came euery man from his worke which they wrought,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring  much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Moses gaue a commandement, and they caused it to be proclaymed throughout the hoste, saying, Let neither man nor woman prepare any more worke for the oblation of the Sanctuarie.
