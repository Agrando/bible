turne from thy fearce wrath, and change thy minde from this euill towarde thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember  Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit [it] for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Lord changed his minde fro the euil, which he threatned to do vnto his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Moses returned and went downe from the mountaine with the two Tables of the Testimonie in his hande: the Tables were written on both their sides, euen on the one side and on the other were they written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the tables [were] the work of God, and  the writing [was] the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Ioshua heard the noyse of the people, as they shouted, he said vnto Moses, There is a noyse of warre in the hoste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who answered, It is not the noyse of them that haue the victorie, nor the noyse of them that are ouercome: but I do heare ye noyse of singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nowe, as soone as he came neere vnto the hoste, he sawe the calfe and the dancing: so Moses wrath waxed hote, and he cast the Tables out of his handes, and brake them in pieces beneath the mountaine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt [it] in the fire, and ground [it] to powder, and strawed [it] upon the water, and made the children of Israel  drink [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also Moses said vnto Aaron, What did this people vnto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Aaron answered, Let not the wrath of my Lord waxe fearce: Thou knowest this people, that they are euen set on mischiefe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they sayde vnto me, Make vs gods to go before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses (the man that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then I sayde to them, Ye that haue golde, plucke it off: and they brought it me, & I did cast it into the fire, and thereof came this calfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Moses saw that the people [were]  naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto [their] shame among their enemies:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Moses stoode in ye gate of the campe, and sayde, Who pertaineth to the Lorde? let him come to mee; all the sonnes of Leui gathered themselues vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and  slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the children of Leui did as Moses had commanded: and there fel of the people the same day about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his  son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when the morning came, Moses sayde vnto the people, Yee haue committed a grieuous crime: but now I wil goe vp to the Lord, if I may pacifie him for your sinne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Moses therefore went againe vnto ye Lord, and said, Oh, this people haue sinned a great sinne, and haue made them gods of golde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee,  out of thy book which thou hast written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my  book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore now go, lead the people unto [the place] of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So the Lorde plagued the people, because they caused Aaro to make ye calfe which he made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
