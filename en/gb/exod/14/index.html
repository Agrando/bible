And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then it was told the King of Egypt, that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his seruants was turned against the people, and they sayde, Why haue we this done, and haue let Israel go out of our seruice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he made ready his charets, and tooke his people with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and  all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an  high hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Egyptians pursued after them, and all the horses and charets of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his hoste ouertooke them camping by the Sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore  afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they sayde vnto Moses, Hast thou brought vs to die in the wildernes, because there were no graues in Egypt? wherefore hast thou serued vs thus, to carie vs out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>[Is] not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let  us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For [it had been] better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Moses sayde to the people, Feare ye not, stand still, and beholde the saluation of the Lord which he will shew to you this day. For the Egyptians, whome ye haue seene this day, ye shall neuer see them againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall  hold your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore  criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And lift thou vp thy rod, and stretche out thine hand vpon the Sea and deuide it, and let the children of Israel goe on drie ground thorow the middes of the Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I, beholde, I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, that they may followe them, and I wil get me honour vpon Pharaoh, & vpon all his host, vpon his charets, and vpon his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lorde, when I haue gotten me honour vpon Pharaoh, vpon his charets, & vpon his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(And the Angel of God, which went before the hoste of Israel, remoued & went behinde them: also the pillar of the cloude went from before them, and stoode behinde them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness [to them], but it gave  light by night [to these]: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses stretched forth his hande vpon the Sea, & the Lord caused the sea to runne backe by a strong East winde all the night, & made the Sea dry land: for the waters were deuided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the children of Israel went through the middes of the Sea vpon the drie ground, and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hand, and on their left hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Egyptians pursued and went after them to the middes of the Sea, euen all Pharaohs horses, his charets, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, that in the morning  watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he tooke off their charet wheeles, and they draue them with much a doe: so that the Egyptians euery one sayd, I wil flee from the face of Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the Lord sayde to Moses, Stretche thine hand vpon the Sea, that the waters may returne vpon the Egyptians, vpon their charets and vpon their horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD  overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the water returned & couered the charets and the horsemen, euen all the hoste of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them: there remained not one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the children of Israel walked vpon dry land thorowe the middes of the Sea, and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hande, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus the Lorde saued Israel the same day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel sawe the Egyptians dead vpon the Sea banke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his  servant Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
