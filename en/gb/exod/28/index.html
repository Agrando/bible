and shalt anoint them, and  consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Thou shalt also make them linen breeches to couer their priuities: from the loynes vnto the thighs shall they reache.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy [place]; that they  bear not iniquity, and die: [it shall be] a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
