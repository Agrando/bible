lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by  the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou shalt say vnto him, The Lorde God of the Ebrewes hath sent me vnto thee, saying, Let my people goe, that they may serue mee in the wildernesse: and beholde, hitherto thou wouldest not heare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus saith the Lorde, In this shalt thou know that I am the Lord: behold, I wil smite with the rodde that is in mine hand vpon the water that is in the riuer, and it shalbe turned to blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fish that is in the riuer shall dye, and the riuer shall stinke, and it shall grieue the Egyptians to drinke of the water of the riuer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord then spake to Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand ouer the waters of Egypt, ouer their streames, ouer their riuers, & ouer their pondes,, and ouer all pooles of their waters, and they shalbe blood, and there shalbe blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Moses and Aaron did euen as the Lord commaunded: and hee lift vp the rodde, and smote the water that was in the riuer in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his seruants: and all the water that was in the riuer, was turned into blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the  fish that [was] in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the magicians of Egypt did  so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Pharaoh returned, and went againe into his house, neither did this yet enter into his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All the Egyptians then digged rounde about the riuer for waters to drinke: for they could not drinke of the water of the riuer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this continued fully seuen dayes after the Lord had smitten the riuer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
