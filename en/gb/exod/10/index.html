So he returned, and went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a  snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Moses and Aaron were brought againe vnto Pharaoh, and he saide vnto them, Goe, serue the Lorde your God, but who are they that shall goe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses answered, We will go with our yong and with our olde, with our sonnes and with our daughters, with our sheepe and with our cattell will we goe: for we must celebrate a feast vnto the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said unto them, Let  the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look [to it]; for  evil [is] before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It shall not be so: nowe goe ye that are men, and serue the Lorde: for that was your desire. Then they were thrust out from Pharaohs presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After, the Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hande vpon the lande of Egypt for the grashoppers, that they may come vpon the lande of Egypt, and eate all the herbes of the land, euen all that the haile hath left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Moses stretched foorth his rod vpon the lande of Egypt: and the Lorde brought an East winde vpon the land all that day, and al that night: and in the morning the East wind brought the grashoppers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the grashoppers went vp vpon all the land of Egypt, and remained in all quarters of Egypt: so grieuous Grashoppers, like to these were neuer before, neither after them shalbe such.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they couered all the face of the earth, so that the lande was darke: and they did eate all the herbes of the lande, and all the fruites of the trees, which the haile had left, so that there was no greene thing left vpon the trees, nor among the herbes of the fielde throughout all the lande of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Pharaoh called for  Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And nowe forgiue mee my sinne onely this once, and pray vnto the Lord your God, that hee may take away from me this death onely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moses then went out from Pharaoh, and prayed vnto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the  Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, & hee did not let the children of Israel goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness [which] may be  felt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Moses stretched forth his hande towarde heauen, and there was a blacke darkenesse in all the land of Egypt three daies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>No man saw an other, neither rose vp from ye place where he was for three dayes: but all the children of Israel had light where they dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Pharaoh called for Moses & said, Go, serue the Lord: onely your sheepe and your cattel shall abide, and your children shall go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses sayd, Thou must giue vs also sacrifices, and burnt offrings that wee may doe sacrifice vnto the Lord our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an  hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not  with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>(But the Lorde hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them goe)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in [that] day thou seest my face thou shalt  die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Moses said, Thou hast said wel: from henceforth will I see thy face no more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
