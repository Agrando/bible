And it came to pass, [that] every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which [was] without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when Moses went out vnto the Tabernacle, all the people rose vp, and stood euery man at his tent doore, and looked after Moses, vntil he was gone into the Tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And assoone as Moses was entred into the Tabernacle, the cloudie pillar descended & stood at the doore of the Tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nowe when all the people saw the cloudie pillar stand at the Tabernacle doore, all the people rose vp, and worshipped euery man in his tent doore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses  face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by  name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nowe therefore, I pray thee, if I haue founde fauour in thy sight, shewe mee nowe thy way, that I may knowe thee, and that I may finde grace in thy sight: consider also that this nation is thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, My  presence shall go [with thee], and I will give thee rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he sayd vnto him, If thy presence go not with vs, cary vs not hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And wherein nowe shal it be knowen, that I and thy people haue found fauour in thy sight? Shall it not be when thou goest with vs? so I, and thy people shall haue preeminence before all the people that are vpon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Lord sayde vnto Moses, I will doe this also that thou hast saide: for thou hast founde grace in my sight, and I knowe thee by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy  glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, I will make all my  goodness pass before thee, and I will  proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew  mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and  live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said, Behold, [there is] a place by  me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while my glory passeth by, I will put thee in a cleft of the rocke, and will couer thee with mine hand whiles I passe by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my  back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
