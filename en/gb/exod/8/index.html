and the frogs came up, and covered the land of  Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the sorcerers did likewise with their sorceries, and brought frogges vp vpon the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said,  Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said vnto Pharaoh, Concerning me, euen command when I shall pray for thee, and for thy seruants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogges from thee and from thine houses, that they may remaine in the riuer only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said, To morowe; he answered, Be it as thou hast said, that thou maiest know, that there is none like vnto the Lord our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the frogges shall depart from thee, and from thine houses, and from thy seruantes, and from thy people: onely they shall remaine in the riuer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cryed vnto the Lorde concerning the frogges, which hee had sent vnto Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs  died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they gathered the together by heaps, and the land stanke of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when Pharaoh sawe that hee had rest giuen him, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not vnto them, as the Lord had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Againe the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Stretche out the rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may bee turned to lyce throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth: and lyce came vpon man and vpon beast: all the dust of the earth was lyce throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they  could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This [is]  the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreouer the Lorde sayd to Moses, Rise vp earely in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh (lo, hee will come forth vnto the water) and say vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serue me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Els, if thou wilt not let my people goe, behold, I will send swarmes of flies both vpon thee, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thine houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shalbe full of swarmes of flies, and the ground also whereon they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But ye land of Goshe, where my people are, wil I cause to be wonderfull in that day, so that no swarmes of flies shalbe there, that thou maiest know that I am the Lorde in the middes of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will make a deliuerance of my people from thy people: to morowe shall this miracle be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Lorde did so: for there came great swarmes of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his seruants houses, so that through all the lande of Egypt, the earth was corrupt by the swarmes of flies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and saide, Goe, doe sacrifice vnto your God in this lande.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the  abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Let vs go three dayes iourney in the desert, and sacrifice vnto the Lord our God, as he hath commanded vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not  go very far away: intreat for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal  deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moses went out from Pharaoh & prayed vnto the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord did according to the saying of Moses, and the swarmes of flies departed from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people, and there remained not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Pharaoh  hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
