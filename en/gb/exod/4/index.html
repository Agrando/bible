And he answered, A rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then said he, Cast it on the ground. So he cast it on the grounde, and it was turned into a serpent: and Moses fled from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Againe the Lorde saide vnto Moses, Put foorth thine hand, and take it by the tayle. Then he put foorth his hande and caught it, and it was turned into a rod in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lorde saide furthermore vnto him, Thrust nowe thine hand into thy bosome; he thrust his hand into his bosome, & when he tooke it out againe, behold, his hand was leprous as snowe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moreouer he said, Put thine hand into thy bosome againe. So he put his hande into his bosome againe, & pluckt it out of his bosome, and behold, it was turned againe as his other flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So shall it be, if they wil not beleeue thee, neither obey the voyce of ye first signe, yet shall they beleeue for the voyce of the seconde signe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the  water of the river, and pour [it] upon the dry [land]: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry [land].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Moses said vnto the Lorde, Oh my Lorde, I am not eloquent, neither at any time haue bene, nor yet since thou hast spoken vnto thy seruant: but I am slowe of speach & slowe of tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Lorde said vnto him, Who hath giuen the mouth to man? or who hath made the domme, or the deafe, or him that seeth, or the blinde? haue not I the Lorde?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore goe nowe, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand [of him whom] thou  wilt send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the  anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, [Is] not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou shalt speak unto him, and  put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, [even] he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of  God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreouer thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore Moses went and returned to Iethro his father in lawe, & said vnto him, I pray thee, let me goe, and returne to my brethren, which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet aliue. Then Iethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(For the Lord had said vnto Moses in Midian, Goe, returne to Egypt: for they are all dead which went about to kill thee)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the  rod of God in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will  harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel [is] my son, [even] my  firstborn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Wherefore I say to thee, Let my sonne go, that he may serue me: if thou refuse to let him goe, beholde, I will slay thy sonne, euen thy first borne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and  sought to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and  cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast [it] at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband [art] thou to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he departed from him. Then she saide, O bloodie husbande (because of the circumcision)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the Lorde saide vnto Aaron, Goe meete Moses in the wildernesse; he went and mette him in the Mount of God, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Moses tolde Aaron all the wordes of the Lord, who had sent him, and all the signes wherewith he had charged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So went Moses and Aaron, and gathered all the Elders of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Aaron told all the wordes, which the Lorde had spoken vnto Moses, and he did the miracles in the sight of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the  people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
