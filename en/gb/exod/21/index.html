the wife and her children shall be her  master's, and he shall go out by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if the seruant saye thus, I loue my master, my wife and my children, I will not goe out free,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the  door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for  ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if a man  sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall  he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her  after the manner of daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he take  him another [wife]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if he do not these  three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that smiteth a man, and he die, shal dye the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if a man lie not in wait, but  God deliver [him] into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine  altar, that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also hee that smiteth his father or his mother, shall die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, if it be founde with him, shal die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And hee that curseth his father or his mother, shall die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if men strive together, and one smite another with a  stone, or with [his] fist, and he die not, but keepeth [his] bed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote [him] be  quit: only he shall pay [for] the loss of his time, and shall cause [him] to be thoroughly healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if a man smite his seruant, or his maide with a rod, and he die vnder his hande, he shalbe surely punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not  be punished: for he [is] his money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart [from her], and yet no  mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges [determine].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if death followe, then thou shalt paye life for life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Burning for burning, wound for wounde, stripe for stripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if a man smite his seruant in the eie, or his maide in the eye, and hath perished it, hee shall let him goe free for his eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if he smite  out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth;

he shall give unto their master thirty  shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when a man shall open a well, or when he shall dig a pit and couer it not, and an oxe or an asse fall therein,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The owner of the pit shall  make [it] good, [and] give money unto the owner of them; and the dead [beast] shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if a mans oxe hurt his neighbours oxe that he die, then they shal sel the liue oxe, & deuide the money thereof, and the dead oxe also they shall deuide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or if it bee knowen that the oxe hath vsed to push in times past, & his master hath not kept him, he shal pay oxe for oxe, but the dead shall be his owne.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
