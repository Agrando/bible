(Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he had apprehended him, he put [him] in prison, and delivered [him] to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Herod woulde haue brought him out vnto the people, the same night slept Peter betweene two souldiers, bound with two chaines, and the keepers before the doore, kept the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon [him], and a light shined in the  prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from [his] hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Angel saide vnto him, Girde thy selfe, and binde on thy sandales; so he did. Then he said vnto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and followe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Peter came out and followed him, and knewe not that it was true, which was done by the Angel, but thought he had seene a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nowe when they were past the first and the second watch, they came vnto the yron gate, that leadeth vnto the citie, which opened to them by it owne accord, and they went out, and passed through one streete, and by and by the Angel departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when Peter was come to himselfe, he said, Nowe I know for a trueth, that the Lord hath sent his Angel, and hath deliuered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the wayting for of the people of the Iewes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he had considered [the thing], he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel  came to hearken, named Rhoda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when she knew Peters voyce, she opened not the entrie doore for gladnesse, but ranne in, and tolde howe Peter stood before the entrie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they said vnto her, Thou art mad. Yet she affirmed it constantly, that it was so. Then said they, It is his Angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened it, and sawe him, they were astonied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commaunded them to be led to be punished; he went downe from Iudea to Cesarea, and there abode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's [country].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And vpon a day appointed, Herod arayed himselfe in royall apparell, and sate on the iudgement seate, and made an oration vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people gave a shout, [saying, It is] the voice of a god, and not of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he  gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the  word of God grew and multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Barnabas and Saul returned from Hierusalem, when they had fulfilled their office, and tooke with them Iohn, whose surname was Marke.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
