And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there accompanied him into Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of them of Thessalonica, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of them of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These went before, and taried vs at Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And we sailed forth from Philippi, after the dayes of vnleauened bread, & came vnto them to Troas in fiue dayes, where we abode seuen dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And upon the  first [day] of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there sate in a windowe a certaine yong man, named Eutychus, fallen into a dead sleepe: and as Paul was long preaching, hee ouercome with sleepe, fell downe from the thirde loft, and was taken vp dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Paul went downe, and layde himselfe vpon him, and embraced him, saying, Trouble not your selues: for his life is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then when Paul was come vp againe, and had broken bread, and eaten, hauing spoken a long while till the dawning of the day, hee so departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the boye aliue, and they were not a litle comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then we went before to shippe, and sailed vnto the citie Assos, that wee might receiue Paul there: for so had hee appointed, and would himselfe goe afoote.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when he was come vnto vs to Assos, and we had receiued him, we came to Mitylenes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And wee sailed thence, and came the next day ouer against Chios, and the next day we arriued at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium: the next day we came to Miletum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And from  Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Seruing the Lorde with all modestie, and with many teares, and tentations, which came vnto me by the layings awaite of the Iewes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[And] how I kept  back nothing that was profitable [unto you], but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Witnessing both to the Iewes, and to the Grecians the repentance towarde God, and faith toward our Lord Iesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, behold, I go  bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saue that ye holy Ghost witnesseth in euery citie, saying, that bondes and afflictions abide me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I passe not at all, neither is my life deare vnto my selfe, so that I may fulfill my course with ioye, and the ministration which I haue receiued of the Lorde Iesus, to testifie the Gospell of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now behold, I know that henceforth ye all, through whome I haue gone preaching the kingdome of God, shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I [am]  pure from the blood of all [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to  feed the church of God, which  he hath purchased with  his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to  draw away disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watche, and remember, that by the space of three yeres I ceased not to warne euery one, both night and day with teares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an  inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yea, ye knowe, that these handes haue ministred vnto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought  to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled downe, and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Being chiefly sorie for the words which he spake, That they should see his face no more; they accompanied him vnto the shippe.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
