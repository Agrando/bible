brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And when Peter was come vp to Hierusalem, they of the circumcision contended against him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Saying, Thou wentest in to men vncircumcised, and hast eaten with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Peter beganne, and expounded the thing in order to them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I was in the citie of Ioppa, praying, and in a trance I sawe this vision, A certaine vessell comming downe as it had bene a great sheete, let downe from heauen by the foure corners, and it came to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Towarde the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and sawe foure footed beastes of the earth, and wilde beastes, and creeping things, and foules of the heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Also I heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Arise, Peter: slay and eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said, God forbid, Lord: for nothing polluted or vncleane hath at any time entred into my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the voyce answered me the seconde time from heauen, The things that God hath purified, pollute thou not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this was done three times, and all were taken vp againe into heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then behold, immediatly there were three men already come vnto the house where I was, sent from Cesarea vnto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Spirit saide vnto me, that I should go with them, without doubting: moreouer these sixe brethren came with me, and we entred into the mans house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he shewed vs, howe he had seene an Angel in his house, which stoode and said to him, Send men to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shall speake wordes vnto thee, whereby both thou and all thine house shalbe saued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speake, the holy Ghost fell on them, euen as vpon vs at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then I remembred the word of the Lord, howe he said, Iohn baptized with water, but ye shalbe baptized with the holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For as much then as God gaue them a like gift, as he did vnto vs, when we beleeued in the Lorde Iesus Christ, who was I, that I coulde let God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and  Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, so that a great number beleeued and turned vnto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who when he was come and had seene the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted all, that with purpose of heart they would continue in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghost, and faith, and much people ioyned them selues vnto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he had founde him, he brought him vnto Antiochia: and it came to passe that a whole yere they were conuersant with ye Church, and taught much people, in so much that the disciples were first called Christians in Antiochia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there stoode vp one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit, that there should be great famine throughout all the world, which also came to passe vnder Claudius Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send  relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Which thing they also did, and sent it to the Elders, by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span>
