And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are  come up for  a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Nowe therefore send men to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hee lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the Angel which spake vnto Cornelius, was departed, he called two of his seruants, and a souldier that feared God, one of them that waited on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And tolde them all things, and sent them to Ioppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On the morow as they went on their iourney, and drew neere vnto the citie, Peter went vp vpon the house to pray, about the sixt houre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a  trance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the  four corners, and let down to the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherein were  all manner of  fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and  creeping things, and fowls of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came a voyce to him, Arise, Peter: kill, and eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the voice [spake] unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, [that]  call not thou common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This was so done thrise: and the vessell was drawen vp againe into heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nowe while Peter douted in himselfe what this vision which he had seene, meant, beholde, the men which were sent from Cornelius, had inquired for Simons house, and stoode at the gate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And called, and asked, whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit sayde vnto him, Beholde, three men seeke thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Arise therefore, and get thee downe, and goe with them, and doute nothing: For I haue sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter went downe to the men, which were sent vnto him from Cornelius, and sayd, Beholde, I am he whome ye seeke: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they sayd, Cornelius the captaine, a iust man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Iewes, was warned from heauen by an holy Angel, to send for thee into his house, and to heare thy wordes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then called he them in, and lodged them, and the next day, Peter went foorth with them, and certaine brethren from Ioppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the day after, they entred into Cesarea. Nowe Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsemen, and special friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter tooke him vp, saying, Stand vp: for euen I my selfe am a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he talked with him, he came in, and found many that were come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he sayd vnto them, Ye know that it is an vnlawfull thing for a man that is a Iewe, to company, or come vnto one of another nation: but God hath shewed me, that I should not call any man polluted, or vncleane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore came I vnto you without saying nay, when I was sent for. I aske therefore, for what intent haue ye sent for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until  this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of [one] Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then sent I for thee immediately, and thou hast well done to come. Nowe therefore are we all here present before God, to heare all things that are commanded thee of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Peter opened [his] mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that  God is no respecter of persons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But in every nation he that  feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The  word which [God] sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>That word, [I say], ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>How God  anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Iewes, and in Hierusalem, whom they slewe, hanging him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Him God raysed vp the third day, and caused that he was shewed openly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses  chosen before of God, [even] to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie, that it is he that is ordained of God a iudge of quicke and dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>To him also giue all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name all that beleeue in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So they of the circumcision which beleeued, were astonied, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was powred out the gift of the holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speake with tongues, and magnifie God. Then answered Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tary certaine dayes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
