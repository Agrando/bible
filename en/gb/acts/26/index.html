So Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himselfe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Chiefly, because thou hast knowledge of all customes, and questions which are among the Iewes: wherefore I beseech thee, to heare me patiently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Which  knew me from  the beginning, if they would testify, that after the  most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whereunto our twelue tribes instantly seruing God day and night, hope to come: for the which hopes sake, O King Agrippa, I am accused of the Iewes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I also verely thought in my selfe, that I ought to doe many contrarie things against the Name of Iesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave  my voice against [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and  compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto strange cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At which time, euen as I went to Damascus with authoritie, and commission from the hie Priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At midday, O King, I sawe in the way a light from heauen, passing the brightnes of the sunne, shine round about mee, and them which went with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voyce speaking vnto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kicke against pricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I sayd, Who art thou, Lord? And he sayd, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But rise and stand vp on thy feete: for I haue appeared vnto thee for this purpose, to appoint thee a minister and a witnesse, both of the things which thou hast seene, and of the things in the which I will appeare vnto thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Deliuering thee from this people, and from the Gentiles, vnto whom now I send thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But shewed first vnto them of Damascus, and at Hierusalem, & throughout all the coasts of Iudea, & then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turne to God, and doe workes worthy amendement of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this cause the Iewes caught me in the Temple, and went about to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to  small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That Christ should  suffer, [and] that he should be the  first that should rise from the dead, and should shew  light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he said, I am not mad, O noble Festus, but I speake the wordes of trueth and sobernes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a  corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Agrippa said vnto Paul, Almost thou perswadest me to become a Christian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul said,  I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they were gone apart, they talked betweene themselues, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death, nor of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then sayd Agrippa vnto Festus, This man might haue bene loosed, if hee had not appealed vnto Cesar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
