And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said unto them, Unto  what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto  John's baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then saide Paul, Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme of repentance, saying vnto the people, that they shoulde beleeue in him, which should come after him, that is, in Christ Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when they heard it, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Paul layde his handes vpon them, and the holy Ghost came on them, and they spake the tongues, and prophecied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all the men were about twelue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moreouer he went into the Synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three moneths, disputing and exhorting to the things that appertaine to the kingdome of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that  way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one  Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this was done by the space of two yeeres, so that all they which dwelt in Asia, heard the word of ye Lord Iesus, both Iewes & Grecians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God wrought no small miracles by the handes of Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that from his body were brought vnto the sicke, kerchefs or handkerchefs, and the diseases departed from them, and the euill spirits went out of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then certain of the vagabond Jews,  exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(And there were certaine sonnes of Sceua a Iewe, the Priest, about seuen which did this)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the euil spirit answered, and said, Iesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know: but who are ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and  prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this was knowen to all the Iewes and Grecians also, which dwelt at Ephesus, and feare came on them all, and the Name of the Lord Iesus was magnified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And many that believed came, and  confessed, and shewed their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all [men]: and they counted the price of them, and found [it]  fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the worde of God grewe mightily, and preuailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the  spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So sent hee into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto him, Timotheus and Erastus, but he remained in Asia for a season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For a certain [man] named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver  shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom he called together, with the workemen of like things, and saide, Syrs, ye knowe that by this craft we haue our goods:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreouer ye see and heare, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia this Paul hath perswaded, and turned away much people, saying, That they be not gods which are made with handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So that not only  this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now when they heard it, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the whole citie was full of confusion, and they rushed into the common place with one assent, and caught Gaius, and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, and Pauls companions of his iourney.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Paul would haue entred in vnto the people, the disciples suffred him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring [him] that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assemblie was out of order, and the more part knewe not wherefore they were come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And some of the company drew foorth Alexander, the Iewes thrusting him forwards. Alexander then beckened with the hande, and woulde haue excused the matter to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, [Ye] men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which  fell down from Jupiter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Seeing then that no man can speake against these things, ye ought to be appeased, and to doe nothing rashly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yee haue brought hither these men, which haue neither committed sacrilege, neither doe blaspheme your goddesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a  matter against any man, the  law is open, and there are  deputies: let them implead one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a  lawful assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we are euen in ieopardie to be accused of this dayes sedition, for as much as there is no cause, whereby we may giue a reason of this concourse of people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he had thus spoken, hee let the assembly depart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
