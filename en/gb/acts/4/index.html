for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them [is] manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But that it be noysed no farther among the people, let vs threaten and charge them, that they speake hencefoorth to no man in this Name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So they called them, and commaunded them, that in no wise they should speake or teach in the Name of Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we cannot but speake the things which we haue seene and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all [men] glorified God for that which was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man was aboue fourtie yeeres olde, on whome this miracle of healing was shewed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou [art] God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Which by the mouth of thy seruant Dauid hast saide, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people imagine vaine things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The Kings of the earth assembled, and the rulers came together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the  people of Israel, were gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For to  do whatsoever  thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And nowe, O Lorde, beholde their threatnings, and graunt vnto thy seruants with all boldnesse to speake thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So that thou stretch forth thine hand, that healing, and signes, and wonders may be done by the Name of thine holy Sonne Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the multitude of them that believed were of  one heart and of one soul: neither said any [of them] that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power gaue the Apostles witnes of the resurrection of the Lord Iesus: and great grace was vpon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And layde it downe at the Apostles feete, and it was distributed vnto euery man, according as he had neede.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Also Ioses which was called of the Apostles, Barnabas (that is by interpretation the sonne of consolation) being a Leuite, and of the countrey of Cyprus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Where as he had land, solde it, and brought the money, & laid it downe at the Apostles feete.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
