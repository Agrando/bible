determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto [one] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And we entred into a ship of Adramyttium purposing to saile by the coastes of Asia, and launched foorth, and had Aristarchus of Macedonia, a Thessalonian, with vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the next day we arriued at Sidon: and Iulius courteously entreated Paul, and gaue him libertie to go vnto his friends, that they might refresh him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And from thence we launched, and sayled hard by Cyprus, because ye windes were contrarie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then sayled we ouer the sea by Cilicia, and Pamphilia, and came to Myra, a citie in Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there the Centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sayling into Italie, and put vs therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against  Salmone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And with much adoe sayled beyond it, and came vnto a certaine place called the Faire hauens, neere vnto the which was the citie Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the  fast was now already past, Paul admonished [them],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And sayde vnto them, Syrs, I see that this voiage will be with hurt & much damage, not of the lading and ship onely, but also of our liues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because the hauen was not commodious to winter in, many tooke counsell to depart thence, if by any meanes they might attaine to Phenice, there to winter, which is an hauen of Candie, and lyeth toward the Southwest and by West, and Northwest and by West.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the Southerne winde blew softly, they supposing to atteine their purpose, loosed neerer, and sailed by Candie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after there arose against  it a tempestuous wind, called  Euroclydon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the ship was caught, and could not resist the winde, we let her goe, and were caried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we ran vnder a litle Yle named Clauda, and had much a doe to get the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Which they tooke vp and vsed all helpe, vndergirding the ship, fearing least they should haue fallen into Syrtes, and they strake saile, and so were caried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the third day we cast out with our owne hands the tackling of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when neither sunne nor starres in many dayes appeared, and no small tempest lay vpon vs, all hope that we should be saued, was then taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shalbe no losse of any mans life among you, saue of the ship onely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there stood by me this night the Angel of God, whose I am, and whome I serue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying, Feare not, Paul: for thou must be brought before Cesar: and lo, God hath giuen vnto thee freely all that sayle with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Howbeit, we must be cast into a certaine Iland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in  Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed  that they drew near to some country;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And sounded, & found it twentie fathoms: and when they had gone a litle further, they sounded againe, and found fifteene fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then fearing least they should haue fallen into some rough places, they cast foure ancres out of the sterne, and wished that the day were come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the souldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought [them] all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wherefore I pray you to take [some] meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an  hair fall from the head of any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he had thus spoken, hee tooke bread and gaue thankes to God, in presence of them all, and brake it, and began to eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then were they all of good courage, and they also tooke meate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nowe we were in the ship in all two hundreth three score and sixteene soules.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And whe they had eaten ynough, they lightened the ship, & cast out the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain  creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when they had taken vp the ankers, they committed the ship vnto the sea, and loosed the rudder bonds, and hoised vp the maine saile to the winde, and drewe to the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And falling into a place where  two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from [their] purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast [themselves] first [into the sea], and get to land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the rest, some on boards, and some on [broken pieces] of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
