To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great  pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus sayd, King Agrippa, & all men which are present with vs, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Iewes haue called vpon me, both at Hierusalem, and here, crying, that he ought not to liue any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet haue I found nothing worthy of death, that he hath committed: neuertheles, seeing that he hath appealed to Augustus, I haue determined to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my  lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For me thinketh it vnreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to shewe the causes which are layde against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
