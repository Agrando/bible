And some said, What will this  babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took him, and brought him unto  Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, [is]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thou bringest certaine strange thinges vnto our eares: we woulde knowe therefore, what these things meane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, [Ye] men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too  superstitious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed by, and beheld your  devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE  UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neither is worshipped with mens handes, as though he needed any thing, seeing hee giueth to all life and breath and all things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And hath made of  one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might  feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our being, as also certaine of your owne Poets haue sayd, for we are also his generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,  graven by art and man's device.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by [that] man whom he hath ordained; [whereof] he hath given  assurance unto all [men], in that he hath raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this [matter].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And so Paul departed from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Howbeit certaine men claue vnto Paul, and beleeued: among whome was also Denys Areopagita, and a woman named Damaris, and other with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
