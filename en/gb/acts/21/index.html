For I am ready not to be bound onely, but also to die at Hierusalem for the Name of the Lord Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after those dayes we trussed vp our fardels, and went vp to Hierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There went with vs also certaine of the disciples of Cesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an olde disciple, with whome we should lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we were come to Hierusalem, the brethren receiued vs gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the next day Paul went in with vs vnto Iames: and all the Elders were there assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they heard [it], they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes, which are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses, and sayest that they ought not to circumcise their sonnes, neither to liue after the customes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What is then to be done? the multitude must needes come together: for they shall heare that thou art come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Doe therefore this that we say to thee. We haue foure men, which haue made a vowe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Them take, and  purify thyself with them, and  be at charges with them, that they may shave [their] heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but [that] thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For as touching ye Gentiles, which beleeue, we haue written, & determined that they obserue no such thing, but that they keepe themselues from things offred to idoles, and from blood, and from that that is strangled, and from fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple,  to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Crying, Men of Israel, helpe: this is the man that teacheth all men euery where against the people, and the Lawe, and this place: moreouer, he hath brought Grecians into the Temple, and hath polluted this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they had seene before Trophimus an Ephesian with him in the citie, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then all the citie was moued, and the people ran together: and they tooke Paul and drewe him out of the Temple, and forth with the doores were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who immediately tooke souldiers & Centurions, and ran downe vnto them: and when they sawe the chiefe Captaine and the souldiers, they left beating of Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the chiefe Captaine came neere and tooke him, and commaunded him to be bound with two chaines, and demaunded who he was, and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And one cryed this, another that, among the people. So when he could not know the certeintie for the tumult, he commaunded him to be led into the castell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when hee came vnto the grieces, it was so that he was borne of the souldiers, for the violence of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as Paul should haue bene led into the castell, he sayd vnto the chiefe Captaine, May I speake vnto thee?
