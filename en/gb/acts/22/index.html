And he said to me, I am Iesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moreouer they that were with me, sawe in deede a light and were afraide: but they heard not the voyce of him that spake vnto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I sayd, What shall I doe, Lord? And the Lorde sayde vnto me, Arise, and goe into Damascus: and there it shall be tolde thee of all things, which are appointed for thee to doe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So when I could not see for the glory of that light, I was led by the hand of them that were with me, and came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one Ananias a godly man, as perteining to the Lawe, hauing good report of all the Iewes which dwelt there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Came vnto me, and stoode, and sayd vnto me, Brother Saul, receiue thy sight: and that same houre I looked vpon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he sayd, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee, that thou shouldest knowe his wil, and shouldest see that Iust one, and shouldest heare the voyce of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thou shalt be his witnes vnto all men, of the things which thou hast seene and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore why tariest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sinnes, in calling on the Name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to passe, that when I was come againe to Hierusalem, and prayed in the Temple, I was in a traunce,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And saw him saying vnto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Hierusalem: for they will not receiue thy witnes concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I sayd, Lord, they know that I prisoned, and beat in euery Synagogue them that beleeued in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that  slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he sayd vnto me, Depart: for I will send thee farre hence vnto the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they gave him audience unto this word, and [then] lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a [fellow] from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as they  cried out, and cast off [their] clothes, and threw dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nowe when the Centurion heard it, hee went, and tolde the chiefe captaine, saying, Take heede what thou doest: for this man is a Romane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the chiefe captaine came, and sayd to him, Tel me, art thou a Romane?
