beholding the council, said, Men [and] brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, [thou]  whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten  contrary to the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they that stood by, sayd, Reuilest thou Gods hie Priest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men [and] brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither  angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there arose a great cry: and the  scribes [that were] of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring [him] into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nowe the night folowing, the Lord stoode by him, and saide, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified of mee in Hierusalem, so must thou beare witnesse also at Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves  under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they were more then fourtie, which had made this conspiracie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they came to the chiefe Priestes and Elders, and said, We haue bound our selues with a solemne curse, that wee will eate nothing, vntill we haue slaine Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore ye with the  council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Pauls sisters sonne heard of their laying awaite, he went, and entred into the castel, and tolde Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Paul called one of the centurions unto [him], and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So hee tooke him, and brought him to the chiefe captaine, and saide, Paul the prisoner called mee vnto him, and prayed mee to bring this yong man vnto thee, which hath some thing to say vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the chiefe captaine tooke him by the hande, and went apart with him alone, and asked him, What hast thou to shewe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he saide, The Iewes haue conspired to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring foorth Paul to morow into the Council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But let them not perswade thee: for there lie in waite for him of them, more then fourtie men, which haue bound themselues with a curse, that they will neither eate nor drinke, till they haue killed him: and nowe are they readie, and waite for thy promes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the chief captain [then] let the young man depart, and charged [him, See thou] tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he called vnto him two certaine Centurions, saying, Make readie two hundred souldiers, that they may go to Cæsarea, and horsemen three score and ten, and two hundred with dartes, at the thirde houre of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let them make readie an horse, that Paul being set on, may be brought safe vnto Felix the Gouernour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he wrote an epistle in this maner:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix [sendeth] greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As this man was taken of the Iewes, and shoulde haue bene killed of them, I came vpon them with the garison, and rescued him, perceiuing that he was a Romane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when I would haue knowen the cause, wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their Council.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There I perceiued that hee was accused of questions of their Lawe, but had no crime worthy of death, or of bondes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when it was shewed me, how that the Iewes layd waite for the man, I sent him straightway to thee, and commaunded his accusers to speake before thee the thinges that they had against him. Farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the souldiers as it was commaunded them, tooke Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the next day, they left the horsemen to goe with him, and returned vnto the Castel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now when they came to Cæsarea, they deliuered the epistle to the Gouernour, and presented Paul also vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So when the Gouernour had read it, hee asked of what prouince he was: and when he vnderstoode that he was of Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I will heare thee, said he, when thine accusers also are come, and commaunded him to bee kept in Herods iudgement hall.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
