He called vnto him Barnabas and Saul, and desired to heare the woorde of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Saul (which also is called Paul) being full of the holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And said, O full of all subtilty and all  mischief, [thou] child of the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, behold, the  hand of the Lord [is] upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Deputie when he sawe what was done, beleeued, and was astonied at the doctrine of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in  Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, [Ye] men [and] brethren, if ye  have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with [his] hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and  exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an  high arm brought he them out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And about the time of fourtie yeeres, suffered he their maners in the wildernesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he destroied seuen nations in the land of Chanaan, & deuided their lad to them by lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after that he gave [unto them] judges about the space of  four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of  forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And after he had taken him away, he raised vp Dauid to be their King, of whom he witnessed, saying, I haue found Dauid the sonne of Iesse, a man after mine owne heart, which will doe all things that I will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of this man's seed hath God according to [his] promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When John had first preached  before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Iohn had fulfilled his course, he saide, Whom ye thinke that I am, I am not he: but beholde, there commeth one after me, whose shooe of his feete I am not worthy to loose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men [and] brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled [them] in condemning [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they tooke him downe from the tree, and put him in a sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised him from the dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And hee was seene many dayes of them, which came vp with him from Galile to Hierusalem, which are his witnesses vnto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we declare vnto you, that touching the promise made vnto the fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he  hath raised up Jesus again;  as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, [now] no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the  sure mercies of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Wherefore he saith also in another [psalm], Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Howbeit, Dauid after hee had serued his time by the counsell of God, hee slept, and was laid with his fathers, and sawe corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he whom God raised vp, sawe no corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Be it known unto you therefore, men [and] brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And by him all that believe are justified from  all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish away: for I woorke a woorke in your daies, a woorke which yee shall not beleeue, if a man would declare it you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and  religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And ye next Sabbath day came almost the whole citie together, to heare the worde of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and  judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so hath the Lord commanded vs, saying, I haue made thee a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be the saluation vnto the end of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were  ordained to eternal life believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Thus the worde of the Lord was published throughout the whole countrey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews stirred up the  devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with ioy, and with the holy Ghost.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
