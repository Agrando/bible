[namely], Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And wrote letters by them after this maner, The Apostles, and the Elders, and the brethren, vnto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antiochia, and in Syria, and in Cilicia, send greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which  went out from us have troubled you with words,  subverting your souls, saying, [Ye must] be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no [such] commandment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It seemed therefore good to vs, when we were come together with one accord, to send chosen men vnto you, with our beloued Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men that haue giuen vp their liues for the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We haue therefore sent Iudas and Silas, which shall also tell you ye same things by mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed good to the  Holy Ghost, and  to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these  necessary things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had read it, they reioyced for the consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Iudas and Silas being Prophets, exhorted the brethren with many wordes, & strengthened them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after they had tarried [there] a space, they were let go in  peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Notwithstanding Silas thought good to abide there still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antiochia, teaching and preaching with many other, the worde of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, [and see] how they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul thought it not meete to take him vnto their companie, which departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the worke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And  the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended of the brethren vnto the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, stablishing the Churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
