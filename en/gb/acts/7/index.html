The God of  glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in  Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And said vnto him, Come out of thy countrey, and from thy kindred, and come into the land, which I shall shewe thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran; after that his father was dead, God brought him from thence into this land, wherein ye now dwell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not [so much as] to  set his foot on: yet he  promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when [as yet] he had no child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat [them] evil  four hundred years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the nation to whome they shall be in bondage, will I iudge, sayth God: and after that, they shall come forth and serue me in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hee gaue him also the couenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begate Isaac, and circumcised him the eight day: and Isaac begate Iacob, and Iacob the twelue Patriarkes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was  with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him  favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then came there a famine ouer all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction, that our fathers found no sustenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Iacob heard that there was corne in Egypt, he sent our fathers first:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And at the second time, Ioseph was knowen of his brethren, and Iosephs kindred was made knowen vnto Pharao.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then sent Ioseph and caused his father to be brought, and all his kindred, euen threescore and fifteene soules.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Iacob went downe into Egypt, and he dyed, and our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And were  carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor [the father] of Sychem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when the time of the promes drewe neere, which God had sworne to Abraham, the people grewe and multiplied in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Till another King arose, which knewe not Ioseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The same  dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In which time Moses was born, and was  exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he was cast out, Pharaos daughter tooke him vp, and nourished him for her owne sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses was learned in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, and was mightie in wordes and in deedes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nowe when he was full fourtie yeere olde, it came into his heart to visite his brethren, the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And whe he saw one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, & auenged his quarell that had the harme done to him, and smote the Egyptian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For hee supposed his brethren would haue vnderstand, that God by his hande should giue them deliuerance: but they vnderstoode it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the next day, he shewed himselfe vnto them as they stroue, and woulde haue set them at one againe, saying, Syrs, ye are brethren: why doe ye wrong one to another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he that did his neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a prince, and a iudge ouer vs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wilt thou kill mee, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then fled Moses at that saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begate two sonnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an  angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when Moses sawe it, hee wondred at the sight: and as he drew neere to consider it, the voyce of the Lord came vnto him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. Then Moses trembled, & durst not behold it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the Lord said to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feete: for the place where thou standest, is holy ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I haue seene, I haue seene the affliction of my people, which is in Egypt, & I haue heard their groning, and am come downe to deliuer them: and nowe come, and I will sende thee into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send [to be] a ruler and a deliverer by the  hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Hee brought them out, doing wonders, and miracles in the land of Egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wildernes fourtie yeeres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is he that was in the Congregation, in the wildernes with the Angell, which spake to him in mount Sina, and with our fathers, who receiued the liuely oracles to giue vnto vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>To whom our fathers would not obey, but refused, and in their hearts turned backe againe into Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Saying vnto Aaron, Make vs gods that may goe before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they made a  calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then God turned, and  gave them up to worship the  host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices [by the space of] forty years in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Yea, ye  took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Our fathers had the tabernacle of  witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Which also our fathers that came after  brought in with Jesus into the  possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out  before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who found fauour before God, and desired that hee might finde a tabernacle for the God of Iacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But Solomon built him an house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with handes, as saith the Prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Heauen is my throne, and earth is my footestoole: what house wil ye build for me, saith the Lord? or what place is it that I should rest in?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Hath not mine hand made all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ye stiffnecked and  uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers [did], so [do] ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Which of the Prophets haue not your fathers persecuted? & they haue slaine them, which shewed before of the comming of that Iust, of whome ye are now the betrayers and murtherers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Who have received the law by the  disposition of angels, and have not kept [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with [their] teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus  standing on the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And said, Beholde, I see the heauens open, and the Sonne of man standing at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and  ran upon him with one accord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And cast [him] out of the city, and stoned [him]: and the  witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they stoned Steuen, who called on God, and said, Lord Iesus, receiue my spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord,  lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he  fell asleep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
