And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And devout men  carried Stephen [to his burial], and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed [them] to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went to and fro preaching the worde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the people gaue heed vnto those things which Philippe spake, with one accorde, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For vncleane spirits crying with a loud voyce, came out of many that were possessed of them: and many taken with palsies, & that halted, were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was great ioy in that citie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used  sorcery, and  bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whome they gaue heede from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that great power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they gaue heed vnto him, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But assoone as they beleeued Philip, which preached the thinges that concerned the kingdome of God, and the Name of Iesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the  Holy Ghost:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(For as yet, hee was fallen downe on none of them, but they were baptized onely in the Name of the Lord Iesus.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then layd they their handes on them, and they receiued the holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Saying, Giue mee also this power, that on whomsoeuer I lay the handes, he may receiue the holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this  matter: for thy heart is not  right in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I perceive that thou art in the  gall of bitterness, and [in] the  bond of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye haue spoken, come vpon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So they, when they had testified & preached the worde of the Lord, returned to Hierusalem, and preached the Gospel in many townes of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch  of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And as he returned sitting in his charet, he read Esaias the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit said vnto Philip, Goe neere and ioyne thy selfe to yonder charet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip ranne thither, and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias, and said, But vnderstandest thou what thou readest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How can I, except some man should  guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his  humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his  generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the Eunuche answered Philippe, and saide, I pray thee of whome speaketh the Prophet this? of himselfe, or of some other man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, & preached vnto him Iesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went on their way, they came vnto a certaine water, and the Eunuche said, See, here is water: what doeth let me to be baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said,  I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he commaunded the charet to stand stil: & they went downe both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuche, and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And assoone as they were come vp out of the water, the Spirit of the Lorde caught away Philip, that the Eunuche sawe him no more: so he went on his way reioycing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philippe was found at Azotus, and he walked to and fro preaching in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
