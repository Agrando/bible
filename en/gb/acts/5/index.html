Then great feare came on all them that heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the yong men rose vp, and tooke him vp, and caried him out, and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to passe about the space of three houres after, that his wife came in, ignorant of that which was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Peter sayd vnto her, Tell me, solde ye the land for so much? And she sayd, Yea, for so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to  tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband [are] at the  door, and shall carry thee out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then she fell downe straightway at his feete, and yeelded vp the ghost: and the yong men came in, and found her dead, and caried her out, and buried her by her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus by the hands of the Apostles were many signes and wonders shewed among the people (and they were all with one accorde in Solomons porche.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people  magnified them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Also the number of them that beleeued in the Lord, both of men and women, grewe more and more)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In so much that they brought the sicke into the streetes, and layd them on beds and couches, that at the least way the shadowe of Peter, when he came by, might shadow some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There came also a multitude out of the cities round about vnto Hierusalem, bringing sicke folkes, & them which were vexed with vncleane spirits, who were all healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the  sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And laide hands on the Apostles, and put them in the common prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the  words of this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they heard [that], they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the officers came, & found them not in the prison, they returned and tolde it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saying, Certainely we founde the prison shut as sure as was possible, and the keepers standing without, before the doores: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then when the chiefe Priest, and the captaine of the Temple, and the hie Priestes heard these things, they doubted of them, whereunto this would growe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they had brought them, they set them before the Councill, & the chiefe Priest asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend  to bring this man's blood upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Peter and the [other] apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Him hath God lift vp with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Sauiour, to giue repentance to Israel, and forgiuenes of sinnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are his witnesses of these things; and [so is] also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they heard [that], they  were cut [to the heart], and took counsel to slay them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And sayd vnto them, Men of Israel, take heede to your selues, what ye intende to doe touching these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For before these days rose up Theudas,  boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this man, arose vp Iudas of Galile, in the dayes of the tribute, and drewe away much people after him: hee also perished, and all that obeyed him, were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I say unto you,  Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of  men, it will come to nought:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if it be of God, ye can not destroy it, lest ye be found euen fighters against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And to him they agreed, and called the Apostles: and when they had beaten them, they commaunded that they should not speake in the Name of Iesus, and let them goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And daily in the  temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
