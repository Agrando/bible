[but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment [is]  God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring [it] unto me, and I will hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Also I commaunded you the same time all the things which ye should doe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then we departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wildernesse (as yee haue seene) by the way of the mountaine of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commaunded vs: and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And  I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beholde, the Lord thy God hath layde the land before thee: go vp and possesse it, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath saide vnto thee: feare not, neither be discouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the saying pleased me well, and I tooke twelue men of you, of euery tribe one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who departed, and went vp into the mountaine, and came vnto the riuer Eshcol, and searched out the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought [it] down unto us, and brought us word again, and  said, [It is] a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Notwithstanding, ye would not go vp, but were disobedient vnto the commaundement of the Lord your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD  hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Whither shall we go up? our  brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people [is] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I sayd vnto you, Dread not, nor be afrayd of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The LORD your God  which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And in the wildernesse, where thou hast seene how the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doeth beare his sonne, in all the way which ye haue gone, vntill ye came vnto this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet for all this ye did not beleeue the Lord your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tentes in, in fire by night, that ye might see what way to goe, and in a cloude by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the Lorde heard the voyce of your wordes, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Surely there shall not one of these men of this froward generation, see that good land, which I sware to giue vnto your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh: he shall see it, and to him will I giue the land that he hath troden vpon, and to his children, because he hath constantly followed the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also the Lorde was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not goe in thither,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>[But] Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth  before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Moreover your  little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But as for you, turne backe, and take your iourney into the wildernesse by the way of the red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD,  we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I [am]  not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when I told you, ye would not heare, but rebelled against the commaundement of the Lord, and were presumptuous, and went vp into the mountaine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then the Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine came out against you, and chased you (as bees vse to doe) and destroied you in Seir, euen vnto Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not  hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So ye abode in Kadesh a long time, according to the time that ye had remained before.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
