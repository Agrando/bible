thou shalt smite them, [and] utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Neither shalt thou make marriages with them, neither giue thy daughter vnto his sonne, nor take his daughter vnto thy sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For they wil cause thy sonne to turne away from me, and to serue other gods: then will the wrath of the Lord waxe hote against you and destroy thee suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But thus shall ye deal with them;  ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thou art an holy people vnto the Lord thy God, the Lorde thy God hath chosen thee, to be a precious people vnto himselfe, aboue all people that are vpon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Lord did not set his loue vpon you, nor chose you, because ye were mo in number then any people: for ye were the fewest of all people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But because the LORD  loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know therefore  that the LORD thy God, he [is] God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And repayeth  them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Keepe thou therefore the commaundements, and the ordinances, and the lawes, which I commaund thee this day to doe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the  mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he wil loue thee, and blesse thee, and multiplie thee: he will also blesse the fruite of thy wombe, and the fruite of thy land, thy corne and thy wine, and thine oyle and the increase of thy kine, and the flockes of thy sheepe in the land, which he sware vnto thy fathers to giue thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt be blessed aboue all people: there shall be neither male nor female barren among you, nor among your cattell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreouer, the Lorde will take away from thee all infirmities, and will put none of the euill diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) vpon thee, but wil send them vpon all that hate thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee;
