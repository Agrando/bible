he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten  thousands of saints: from his right hand [went] a fiery law for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yea, he loved the people;  all his saints [are] in thy hand: and they sat down at  thy feet; [every one] shall receive of thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moses commanded us a law, [even] the  inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then he was among the righteous people, as King, when the heades of the people, and the tribes of Israel were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let  Reuben live, and not die; and let [not] his men be few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this [is the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be  sufficient for him; and be thou an help [to him] from his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And of Leui he said, Let thy Thummim and thine Vrim be with thine Holy one, whome thou diddest proue in Massah, and didst cause him to striue at the waters of Meribah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Who said unto his father and to his mother,  I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall teach Iaakob thy iudgements, & Israel thy Lawe: they shall put incense before thy face, and the burnt offring vpon thine altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite  through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>[And] of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall  dwell in safety by him; [and the LORD] shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And of Ioseph hee sayde, Blessed of the Lord is his land for the sweetenesse of heauen, for the dewe, and for the depth lying beneath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And for the sweete increase of the sunne, and for the sweete increase of the moone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And for the sweetenes of the top of the ancient mountaines, and for the sweetenes of the olde hilles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and [for] the good will of him that dwelt in the  bush: let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him [that was] separated from his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His beautie shalbe like his first borne bullock, & his hornes as the hornes of an vnicorne: with them hee shall smite the people together, euen the endes of the world: these are also the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy  going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for  they shall suck [of] the abundance of the seas, and [of] treasures hid in the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also of Gad he said, Blessed be hee that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, that catcheth for his praye the arme with the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he provided the first part for himself, because there, [in] a portion of the  lawgiver, [was he] seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And of Dan he said, Dan is a lions whelp: he shall leape from Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou  the west and the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And of Asher he saide, Asher shalbe blessed with children: he shalbe acceptable vnto his brethren, and shall dippe his foote in oyle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thy shoes [shall be]  iron and brass; and as thy days, [so shall] thy strength [be].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There is none like God, O righteous people, which rideth vpon the heauens for thine helpe, and on the cloudes in his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The eternall God is thy refuge, and vnder his armes thou art for euer: hee shall cast out the enemie before thee, and will say, Destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Israel then shall dwell in safety alone:  the fountain of Jacob [shall be] upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Happy [art] thou, O Israel: who [is] like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who [is] the sword of thy excellency! and  thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
