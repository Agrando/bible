for this [is] your  wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation [is] a wise and understanding people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For what nation [is there so] great, who [hath] God [so]  nigh unto them, as the LORD our God [is] in all [things that] we call upon him [for]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And what nation is so great, that hath ordinances and lawes so righteous, as all this Lawe, which I set before you this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Only take heed to thyself, and  keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Forget not the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said vnto me, Gather me the people together, and I wil cause them heare my wordes, that they may learne to feare me all the dayes that they shal liue vpon the earth, and that they may teache their children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain  burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Lorde spake vnto you out of the middes of the fire, and ye heard the voyce of the wordes, but sawe no similitude, saue a voyce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to  perform, [even] ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord commanded me that same time, that I should teach you ordinances & lawes, which ye should obserue in the lande, whither ye goe, to possesse it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no  manner of similitude on the day [that] the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That ye corrupt not your selues, and make you a grauen image or representation of any figure: whither it be the likenes of male or female,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The likenes of any beast that is on earth, or the likenesse of any fethered foule that flieth in the aire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Or the likenesse of any thing that creepeth on the earth, or the likenesse of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, [even] all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath  divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the  iron furnace, [even] out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as [ye are] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lord was angrie with me for your words, and sware that I should not goe ouer Iorden, and that I should not goe in vnto that good land, which the Lord thy God giueth thee for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but  ye shall go over, and possess that good land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take heede vnto your selues, least ye forget the couenant of the Lorde your God which hee made with you, and least ye make you any grauen image, or likenes of any thing, as the Lorde thy God hath charged thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the LORD thy God [is] a  consuming fire, [even] a jealous God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall  corrupt [yourselves], and make a graven image, [or] the likeness of any [thing], and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I  call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong [your] days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the LORD shall  scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there ye shall serue gods, euen ye worke of mans hand, wood, and stone, which neither see, nor heare, nor eate, nor smell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find [him], if thou seek him with all thy  heart and with all thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come vpon thee, at the length if thou returne to the Lorde thy God, and bee obedient vnto his voyce,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>(For the LORD thy God [is] a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he  sware unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and  [ask] from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been [any such thing] as this great thing [is], or hath been heard like it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Did euer people heare the voyce of God speaking out of the middes of a fire, as thou hast heard, and liued?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Or hath God assayed to go [and] take him a nation from the midst of [another] nation, by  temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest  know that the LORD he [is] God; [there is] none else beside him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Out of heauen hee made thee heare his voyce to instruct thee, and vpon earth he shewed thee his great fire, and thou heardest his voyce out of the middes of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And because  he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>To thrust out nations greater and mightier then thou, before thee, to bring thee in, and to giue thee their land for inheritance: as appeareth this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Vnderstande therefore this day, and consider in thine heart, that the Lord, he is God in heauen aboue, and vpon the earth beneath: there is none other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may  go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong [thy] days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Moses separated three cities on this side of Iorden toward the sunne rising:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>That the slayer should flee thither, which had killed his neighbour at vnwares, and hated him not in time past, might flee, I say, vnto one of those cities, and liue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>That is, Bezer in the wildernesse, in the plaine countrey of the Reubenites: and Ramoth in Gilead among the Gadites: and Golan in Bashan among them of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>These [are] the  testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>On this side Iorden, in the valley ouer against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon King of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come out of Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And they possessed his land, and the lande of Og King of Bashan, two Kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Iorden towarde the sunne rising:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>From Aroer, which is by the banke of the riuer Arnon, euen vnto mount Sion, which is Hermon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto  the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
