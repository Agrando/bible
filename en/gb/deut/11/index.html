shalt loue the Lord thy God, and shalt keepe that, which he commandeth to be kept: that is, his ordinances, and his lawes, and his commandements alway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And  know ye this day: for [I speak] not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And his signes, and his actes, which hee did in the middes of Egypt vnto Pharaoh the King of Egypt and vnto all his land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And what he did vnto the hoste of the Egyptians, vnto their horses, and to their charets, when he caused the waters of the red Sea to ouerflowe them, as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroied them vnto this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And  what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And what he did vnto Dathan & Abiram the sonnes of Eliab ye sonne of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, & swallowed them with their housholds and their tents, and all their substance that they had in the middes of al Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For your eyes haue seene all the great actes of the Lord which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore shall ye keep  all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also that ye may prolong your daies in the land, which the Lorde sware vnto your fathers, to giue vnto them and to their seede, euen a lande that floweth with milke and honie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, [is] not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst [it] with thy  foot, as a garden of herbs:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the land whither ye goe to possesse it, is a land of mountaines and valleis, and drinketh water of the raine of heauen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This land doth the Lord thy God care for: the eies of the Lord thy God are alwaies vpon it, from the beginning of the yeere, euen vnto the ende of the yeere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If yee shall hearken therefore vnto my commaundements, which I commaund you this day, that yee loue the Lorde your God and serue him with all your heart, and with all your soule,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That I will give [you] the rain of your land in his due season,  the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also I will send grasse in thy fieldes, for thy cattel, that thou maist eate, and haue inough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not  deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And so the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut vp the heauen, that there be no raine, and that your lande yeelde not her fruit, and yee perish quickly from the good land, which the Lord giueth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore shal ye lay vp these my words in your heart and in your soule, and binde them for a signe vpon your hand, that they may be as a frontlet betweene your eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them, whe thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest downe, and when thou risest vp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And thou shalt write them vpon the postes of thine house, and vpon thy gates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as  the days of heaven upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For if ye keepe diligently all these commandements, which I command you to doe: that is, to loue the Lord your God, to walke in all his waies, and to cleaue vnto him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then will the Lorde cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall possesse great nations and mightier then you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Every place whereon the soles of  your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost  sea shall your coast be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>No man shall stande against you: for the Lorde your God shall cast the feare and dread of you vpon all the land that ye shal treade vpon, as he hath said vnto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Beholde, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The blessing, if ye obey the commandements of the Lorde your God which I command you this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not  known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When the Lord thy God therefore hath brought thee into ye lande, whither thou goest to possesse it, then thou shalt put the blessing vpon mount Gerizim, and the curse vpon mount Ebal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>[Are] they not on the other side Jordan, by the way  where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For yee shall passe ouer Iorden, to goe in to possesse the land, which ye Lorde your God giueth you, and ye shall possesse it, & dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Take heede therefore that ye doe all the commaundements and the lawes, which I set before you this day.</span>
