[as] a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my  righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thou entrest not to inherite their lande for thy righteousnesse, or for thy vpright heart: but for the wickednesse of those nations, the Lord thy God doth cast them out before thee, and that he might performe the worde which the Lord thy God sware vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Iacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou [art] a  stiffnecked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, [and] forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness:  from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also in Horeb ye prouoked the Lorde to anger so that the Lord was wroth with you, euen to destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When I was gone vp into the mount, to receiue the tables of stone, the tables, I say, of the couenant, which the Lord made with you: and I abode in the mount fourtie daies & fourtie nights, and I neither ate bread nor yet dranke water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the  finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes were ended, the Lorde gaue me the two tables of stone, the tables, I say, of the couenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have  corrupted [themselves]; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Furthermore, the Lord spake vnto me, saying, I haue seene this people, and beholde, it is a stifnecked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I returned, and came downe from the Mount (and the Mount burnt with fire, and ye two Tables of the couenant were in my two handes)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, [and] had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the  way which the LORD had commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I tooke the two Tables, and cast them out of my two handes, and brake them before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I fell downe before the Lorde, fourtie dayes, and fourtie nightes, as before: I neither ate bread nor dranke water, because of al your sinnes, which ye had committed, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lorde, in that ye prouoked him vnto wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(For I was afraide of the wrath and indignation, wherewith the Lord was mooued against you, euen to destroy you) yet the Lord heard me at that time also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have  destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, [and] ground [it] very small, [even] until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the  mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also in Taberah, & in Massah and in Kibrothhattaauah ye prouoked ye Lord to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye  rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye haue bene rebellious vnto the Lorde, since the day that I knewe you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus I fell down before the LORD  forty days and forty nights, as I fell down [at the first]; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I prayed vnto the Lorde, and saide, O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatnesse, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt by a mightie hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Lest the countrey, whence thou broughtest them, say, Because ye Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, or because he hated them, he caried them out, to slay them in the wildernesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mightie power, and by thy stretched out arme.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
