and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ye shall not prouoke them: for I wil not giue you of their land so much as a foot breadth, because I haue giuen mount Seir vnto Esau for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ye shall buy meate of them for money to eate, and ye shall also procure water of them for money to drinke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the LORD thy God hath  blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when we were departed from our brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plaine, from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and went by the way of the wildernes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children  of Lot [for] a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The  Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They also were taken for gyants as the Anakims: whom the Moabites call Emims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Horims also dwelt in Seir before time, whome the children of Esau chased out and destroyed them before them, and dwelt in their steade: as Israel shall doe vnto the land of his possession, which the Lord hath giuen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now rise vp, sayd I, and get you ouer the riuer Zered: and we went ouer the riuer Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the  space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, [was] thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For indeed the  hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So when all the men of warre were consumed and dead from among the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the Lord spake vnto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shalt goe through Ar the coast of Moab this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And thou shalt come neere ouer against the children of Ammon: but shalt not lay siege vnto them, nor moue warre against them: for I will not giue thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession: for I haue giuen it vnto the children of Lot for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(That also was accounted a land  of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A people that was great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims: but the Lord destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them in their inheritance, and dwelt in their stead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As he did to the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims before them, and they possessed them, and dwelt in their stead vnto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Auims which dwelt in Hazarim euen vnto Azzah, the Caphtorims which came out of Caphtor destroyed them, and dwelt in their steade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the  Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess [it], and contend with him in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This day will I  begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then I sent messengers out of the wildernes of Kedemoth vnto Sihon King of Heshbon, with wordes of peace, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Let me passe through thy land: I will go by the hie way: I will neither turne vnto the right hand nor to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou shalt sell me meate for money, for to eate, and shalt giue me water for money for to drinke: onely I will go through on my foote,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(As the  children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God  hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lorde sayd vnto me, Beholde, I haue begun to giue Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possesse and inherite his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then came out Sihon to meete vs, him selfe with all his people to fight at Iahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the Lord our God deliuered him into our power, and we smote him, and his sonnes, and all his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the  women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Onely the cattell we tooke to our selues, and the spoyle of the cities which we tooke,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>From Aroer, which is by the banke of the riuer of Arnon, and from the citie that is vpon the riuer, euen vnto Gilead: there was not one citie that escaped vs: for the Lorde our God deliuered vp all before vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Onely vnto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor vnto any place of the riuer Iabbok, nor vnto the cities in the mountaines, nor vnto whatsoeuer the Lorde our God forbade vs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
