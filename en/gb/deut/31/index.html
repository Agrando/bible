Ioshua, he shall goe before thee, as the Lorde hath said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Lord shall doe vnto them, as he did to Sihon and to Og Kings of the Amorites: and vnto their lande whome he destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD shall give them up  before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Plucke vp your hearts therefore, and be strong: dread not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lorde thy God him selfe doeth goe with thee: he will not faile thee, nor forsake thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and  of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD, he [it is] that doth  go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses wrote this Lawe, and deliuered it vnto the Priestes the sonnes of Leui (which bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde) and vnto all the Elders of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses commanded them, saying, Euery seuenth yeere when the yeere of freedome shalbe in the feast of the Tabernacles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When all Israel is come to appear  before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Gather the people together: men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may heare, and that they may learne, and feare the Lorde your God, and keepe and obserue all the wordes of this Lawe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And [that] their children, which  have not known [any thing], may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Lorde saide vnto Moses, Beholde, thy dayes are come, that thou must die: Call Ioshua, and stande ye in the Tabernacle of the Congregation that I may giue him a charge. So Moses and Ioshua went, and stoode in the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a  cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Lorde said vnto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleepe with thy fathers, and this people will rise vp, and goe a whoring after the gods of a strange land (whither they goe to dwell therein) and will forsake me, and breake my couenant which I haue made with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will  hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God [is] not among us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I will surely hide my face in that day, because of all the euill, which they shall commit, in that they are turned vnto other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore write ye this  song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat;  then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall  testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God gaue Ioshua the sonne of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong, and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the lande, which I sware vnto them, and I will be with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Moses had made an ende of writing the wordes of this Lawe in a booke vntill he had finished them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Moses commaunded the Leuites, which bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a  witness against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I knowe thy rebellion and thy stiffe necke: beholde, I being yet aliue with you this day, ye are rebellious against the Lorde: howe much more then after my death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your  officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt [yourselves], and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the  work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus Moses spake in the audience of all the congregation of Israel the wordes of this song, vntill he had ended them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
