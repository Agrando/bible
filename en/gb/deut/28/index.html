to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe [and] to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will  set thee on high above all nations of the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And all these blessings shall come on thee, and  overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed [shalt] thou [be] in the  city, and blessed [shalt] thou [be] in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed [shall be] the fruit  of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Blessed shalbe thy

sore botche, that thou canst not be healed: euen from the sole of thy foote vnto the top of thine head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The LORD shall bring thee, and thy  king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And thou shalt be a wonder, a prouerbe and a common talke among all people, whither the Lord shall carie thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Thou shalt carie out much seede into the fielde, and shalt gather but litle in: for the grashoppers shall destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thou shalt plant a vineyard, and dresse it, but shalt neither drinke of the wine, nor gather the grapes: for the wormes shall eate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou shalt haue Oliue trees in all thy coastes, but shalt not anoynt thy selfe with the oyle: for thine oliues shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thou shalt beget sonnes, and daughters, but shalt not haue them: for they shall goe into captiuitie.</span> <span class="verse"><a

euer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Because thou seruedst not the Lorde thy God with ioyfulnesse and with a good heart for the abundance of all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Therefore thou shalt serue thine enemies which the Lord shal send vpon thee, in hunger & in thirst, and in nakednesse, and in neede of all things? And he shall put a yoke of yron vpon thy necke vntill he haue destroyed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The Lord shall bring a nation vpon thee from farre, euen from the ende of the world, flying swift as an Egle: a nation whose tongue thou shalt not vnderstand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>A nation of a fierce countenance, which will not regarde the person of the olde, nor haue compassion of the yong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>The same shall eate the fruit of thy cattell, and the fruite of thy land vntill thou be destroyed, and he shall leaue thee neyther wheate, wine, nor oyle, neither the increase of thy kyne, nor the flockes of thy sheepe, vntill he haue brought thee to nought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall besiege thee in all thy cities, vntill thine hie and strong walles fall downe, wherein thou trustedst in all the lande: and hee shall besiege thee in all thy cities throughout all thy lande, which the Lorde thy God hath giuen thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And thou shalt eate the fruite of thy bodie: euen the flesh of thy sonnes and thy daughters, which the Lorde thy God hath giuen thee, during the siege & straitnesse wherein thine enemie shall inclose thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So that the man (that is tender and exceeding deintie among you) shalbe grieued at his brother, and at his wife, that lieth in his bosome, and at the remnant of his children, which hee hath yet left,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For feare of giuing vnto any of them of the flesh of his children, whom he shall eate, because he hath nothing left him in that siege, and straitnesse, wherewith thine enemie shall besiege thee in all thy cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The tender and delicate  woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And toward her  young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all [things] secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If thou wilt not observe to do  all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The the Lord wil make thy plagues wonderfull, and the plagues of thy seede, euen great plagues and of long continuance, and sore diseases, and of long durance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Moreouer, he will bring vpon thee all the diseases of Egypt, whereof thou wast afraide, and they shall cleaue vnto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also every sickness, and every plague, which [is] not  written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And ye shall be left few in nomber, where ye were as the starres of heauen in multitude, because thou wouldest not obey the voyce of the Lord thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And as the Lord hath reioyced ouer you, to doe you good, and to multiply you, so he will reioyce ouer you, to destroy you, and bring you to nought, and ye shalbe rooted out of the land, whither thou goest to possesse it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And the LORD shall  scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, [even] wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Also among these nations thou shalt finde no rest, neither shall the sole of thy foote haue rest: for the Lord shal giue thee there a trembling heart, and looking to returne till thine eyes fall out, and a sorowfull minde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And thy life shall hang before thee, and thou shalt feare both night and day, and shalt haue none assurance of thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning thou shalt say, Woulde God it were euening, and at the euening thou shalt say, Would God it were morning, for ye feare of thine heart, which thou shalt feare, and for the sight of thine eyes, which thou shalt see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with  ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy [you].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
