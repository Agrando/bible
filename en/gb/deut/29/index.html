your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, [with] all the men of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Your children, your wiues, and thy stranger that is in thy campe from the hewer of thy wood, vnto the drawer of thy water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>That thou shouldest  enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For to establish thee this day a people vnto him selfe, and that he may be vnto thee a God, as he hath said vnto thee, and as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Neither make I this couenant, & this othe with you onely,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But with [him] that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with [him]  that [is] not here with us this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For ye knowe, how we haue dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we passed thorowe the middes of the nations, which ye passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And ye haue seene their abominations and their idoles (wood, and stone, siluer and golde) which were among them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go [and] serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you  a root that beareth gall and wormwood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add  drunkenness to thirst:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Lord will not be mercifull vnto him, but then the wrath of the Lorde and his ielousie shall smoke against that man, and euery curse that is written in this booke, shall light vpon him, and the Lorde shall put out his name from vnder heauen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lord shall separate him vnto euil out of all the tribes of Israel, according vnto all the curses of the couenant, that is written in the booke of this Lawe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that the  generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(For all that land shall burne with brimstone and salt: it shall not be sowen, nor bring forth, nor any grasse shall growe therein, like as in the ouerthrowing of Sodom, and Gomorah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord ouerthrewe in his wrath and in his anger)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then shall all nations say, Wherefore hath the Lorde done thus vnto this lande? how fierce is this great wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they shall answere, Because they haue forsaken the couenant of the Lorde God of their fathers, which he had made with them, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And went and serued other gods and worshipped them: euen gods which they knewe not, and which had giuen them nothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore the wrath of the Lorde waxed hot against this land, to bring vpon it euery curse that is written in this booke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And ye Lord hath rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and hath cast them into another land, as appeareth this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The  secret [things belong] unto the LORD our God: but those [things which are] revealed [belong] unto us and to our children for ever, that [we] may do all the words of this law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
