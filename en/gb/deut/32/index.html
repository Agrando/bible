they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with [those which are] not a  people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burne vnto the bottome of hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountaines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will spend plagues vpon them: I will bestowe mine arrowes vpon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They shalbe burnt with hunger, and consumed with heate, and with bitter destruction: I will also sende the teeth of beastes vpon them, with the venime of serpents creeping in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sword  without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling [also] with the man of gray hairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I haue said, I would scatter them abroade: I would make their remembrance to cease from among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should  behave themselves strangely, [and] lest they should say, Our hand [is] high, and the LORD hath not done all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For they are a nation voide of counsel, neither is there any vnderstanding in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O that they were wise, [that] they understood this, [that] they would  consider their latter end!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How should one chase a thousand, & two put ten thousande to flight, except their strong God had sold the, & the Lord had shut them vp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For their god is not as our God, euen our enemies being iudges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the vines of Gomorah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters be bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their  wine [is] the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Is not this laide in store with me, and sealed vp among my treasures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Vengeance and recompence are mine: their foote shall slide in due time: for the day of their destruction is at hand, and the things that shall come vpon them, make haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that [their] power is gone, and [there is] none  shut up, or left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When men shal say, Where are their gods, their mighty God in whome they trusted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Which did eate the fat of their sacrifices, & did drinke the wine of their drinke offring? let them rise vp, & help you: let him be your refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Behold now, for I, I am he, and there is no gods with me: I kill, and giue life: I wound, and I make whole: neither is there any that can deliuer out of mine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For I  lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>If I whet my glittering sworde, and mine hand take holde on iudgement, I will execute vengeance on mine enemies, and will rewarde them that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will make mine arrowes drunke with blood, (& my sword shal eate flesh) for the blood of the slaine, and of the captiues, when I beginne to take vengeance of the enemie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Rejoice, O ye nations, [with] his people: for he will avenge the  blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, [and] to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then Moses came and spake all ye words of this song in the audience of the people, he and Hoshea the sonne of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When Moses had made an end of speaking all these wordes to all Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then hee said vnto them, Set your heartes vnto all the wordes which I testifie against you this day, that ye may commande them vnto your children, that they may obserue and doo all the wordes of this Lawe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For it [is] not a  vain thing for you; because it [is] your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong [your] days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the Lord spake vnto Moses the selfe same day, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Goe vp into the mountaine of Abarim, vnto the mount Nebo, which is in the lande of Moab, that is ouer against Iericho: and beholde the lande of Canaan, which I giue vnto the children of Israel for a possession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And die in the mount which thou goest vp vnto, and thou shalt be gathered vnto thy people, as Aaro thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered vnto his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye  sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Thou shalt therefore see the lande before thee, but shalt not go thither, I meane, into the land which I giue the children of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
