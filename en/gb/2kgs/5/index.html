And he departed, and  took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And brought the letter to the King of Israel to this effect, Now when this letter is come vnto thee, vnderstand, that I haue sent thee Naaman my seruant, that thou maiest heale him of his leprosie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the King of Israel had read the letter, he rent his clothes, and sayde, Am I God, to kil and to giue life, that hee doth send to mee, that I should heale a man from his leprosie? wherfore consider, I pray you, and see howe he seeketh a quarel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was [so], when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,  Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Naaman came with his horses, and with his charets, and stoode at the doore of the house of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha sent a messenger vnto him, saying, Go and wash thee in Iorden seuen times, and thy flesh shall come againe to thee, and thou shalt be clensed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Naaman was  wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are not Abanah and Pharpar, riuers of Damascus, better then all the waters of Israel? may I not washe mee in them, and bee cleansed? so hee turned, and departed in displeasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said,  My father, [if] the prophet had bid thee [do some] great thing, wouldest thou not have done [it]? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then went he downe, and washed him selfe seuen times in Iorden, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came againe, like vnto ye flesh of a litle child, & he was cleane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And hee turned againe to the man of God, hee, and all his companie, and came and stood before him, and sayd, Behold, now I knowe that there is no God in all the world, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a reward of thy seruant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said, [As] the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take [it];  but he refused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreouer Naaman sayde, Shall there not be giuen to thy seruant two mules loade of this earth? for thy seruant will henceforth offer neither burnt sacrifice nor offring vnto any other god, saue vnto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In this thing the LORD  pardon thy servant, [that] when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto him,  Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Gehazi the seruant of Elisha the man of God sayde, Beholde, my master hath spared this Aramite Naaman, receiuing not those things at his hand that he brought: as the Lord liueth, I will runne after him, and take somewhat of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw [him] running after him,  he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, [Is] all well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he answered, All is well: my master hath set me, saying, Behold, there be come to me, euen nowe from mount Ephraim two yong men of the children of the Prophets: giue them, I pray thee, a talent of siluer, & two change of garmets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Naaman saide, Yea, take two talents: and he compelled him, and bound two talents of siluer in two bagges, with two change of garments, and gaue them vnto two of his seruants, that they might beare them before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he came to the tower, he took [them] from their hand, and bestowed [them] in the house: and he let the men go, and  they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he went in, and stoode before his master; Elisha said vnto him, Whence commest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy seruant went no whither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said unto him,  Went not mine heart [with thee], when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? [Is it] a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and  oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy  seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
