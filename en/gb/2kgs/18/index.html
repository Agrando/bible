His mothers name also was Abi the daughter of Zachariah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he did [that which was]  right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it  Nehushtan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He trusted in the Lorde God of Israel: so that after him was none like him among all the Kings of Iudah, neither were there any such before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he claue to the Lord, and departed not from him, but kept his commaundements, which the Lord had commaunded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the Lord was with him, and he prospered in all thinges, which he tooke in hande: also he rebelled against the King of Asshur, and serued him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He smote the Philistines, [even] unto Gaza, and the borders thereof,  from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in the fourth yere of King Hezekiah, (which was the seuenth yeere of Hoshea sonne of Elah King of Israel) Shalmaneser King of Asshur came vp against Samaria, and besieged it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And after three yeeres they tooke it, euen in the sixt yeere of Hezekiah: that is, the ninth yeere of Hoshea King of Israel was Samaria taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the King of Asshur did carry away Israel vnto Asshur, and put them in Halah and in Habor, by the riuer of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because they woulde not obey the voyce of the Lord their God, but transgressed his couenant: that is, all that Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded, and would neyther obey nor doe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moreouer, in the fourteenth yeere of King Hezekiah, Saneherib King of Asshur came vp against all the strong cities of Iudah, and tooke them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying,  I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore Hezekiah gaue all the siluer that was found in the house of the Lorde, and in the treasures of the Kings house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At the same season did Hezekiah pul off the plates of the doores of the Temple of the Lord, and the pillars (which the sayd Hezekiah King of Iudah had couered ouer) and gaue them to the King of Asshur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Assyria sent  Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which [is] in the highway of the fuller's field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And called to the King. Then came out to them Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah, which was steward of the house, and Shebnah the chanceller, and Ioah the sonne of Asaph the recorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Rabshakeh sayde vnto them, Tell ye Hezekiah, I pray you, Thus saith the great King, euen the great King of Asshur, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou sayest, (but [they are but] vain words,) [I have]  counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, [even] upon  Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: [is] not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath  taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, give  pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For how canst thou despise any captaine of the least of my masters seruants, and put thy trust on Egypt for charets and horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Am I now come up without the  LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Ioah said vnto Rabshakeh, Speake I pray thee, to thy seruants in the Aramites language, for we vnderstand it, and talke not with vs in the Iewes tongue, in the audience of the people that are on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Rabshakeh saide vnto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master & to thee to speake these words, and not to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eate their owne doung, and drinke their owne pisse with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Rabshakeh stoode and cryed with a loude voyce in the Iewes language, and spake, saying, Heare the wordes of the great King, of the king of Asshur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus sayth the King, Let not Hezekiah deceiue you: for he shall not be able to deliuer you out of mine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Neither let Hezekiah make you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliuer vs, and this citie shall not be giuen ouer into the hand of the king of Asshur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Hearken not vnto Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Asshur, Make appointment with me, and come out to me, that euery man may eate of his owne vine, & euery man of his owne figge tree, and drinke euery man of the water of his owne well,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Until  I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hath any of the gods of the nations deliuered his lande out of the hand of the King of Asshur?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Where is the god of Hamah, and of Arpad? where is the god of Sepharuaim, Hena and Iuah? how haue they deliuered Samaria out of mine hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who [are] they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the  LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the people helde their peace, and answered not him a worde: for the Kings commandement was, saying, Answere ye him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Eliakim, the sonne of Hilkiah which was steward of the house, and Shebnah the chanceller, and Ioah the sonne of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and tolde him the wordes of Rabshakeh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
