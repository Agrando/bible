And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a  pot of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he sayde, Goe, and borowe thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, emptie vessels, and spare not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into  all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So shee departed from him, and shut the doore vpon her, and vpon her sonnes; they brought to her, and she powred out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, [There is] not a vessel more. And the oil  stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the  rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And on a time Elisha came to Shunem, and there a woman of great estimation constrained him to eate bread: and as he passed by, he turned in thither to eate bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she sayde vnto her husband, Beholde, I know now, that this is an holy man of God that passeth by vs continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let us make a  little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And on a day, hee came thither and turned into the chamber, and lay therein,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And sayd to Gehazi his seruant, Call this Shunammite: and when hee called her, she stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care;  what [is] to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I  dwell among mine own people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, What then [is] to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath  no child, and her husband is old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said he, Cal her; hee called her, and shee stoode in the doore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, At this time appointed, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a sonne; she sayd, Oh my Lorde, thou man of God, doe not lye vnto thine handmayd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the woman conceiued, & bare a sonne at that same season, according to the time of life, that Elisha had sayd vnto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the childe was growen, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father, and to the reapers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto his father,  My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And hee tooke him & brought him to his mother, and hee sate on her knees till noone, and dyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then shee went vp, and layed him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the doore vpon him, and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then she called to her husband, & sayd, Send with me, I pray thee, one of the yong men and one of the asses: for I will haste to the man of God, and come againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? [it is] neither  new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, [It shall be] well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then she sadled an asse, and sayde to her seruant, Driue, and goe forward: staye not for me to get vp, except I bid thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So she went, and came vnto the man of God to mount Carmel; when the man of God sawe her ouer against him, he sayd to Gehazi his seruant, Beholde, the Shunammite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Runne nowe, I say, to meete her, and say vnto her, Art thou in health? is thine husband in health? and is the child in health? And she answered, We are in health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she  caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul [is] vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid [it] from me, and hath not told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then she said, Did I desire a sonne of my lord? did I not say, Deceiue me not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way:  if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the mother of the childe sayde, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. Therefore he arose, and followed her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Gehazi was gone before them, & had layed the staffe vpon the face of the childe, but he neither spake nor heard: wherefore hee returned to meete him, and told him, saying, The childe is not waken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then came Elisha into the house, and beholde, the childe was dead, and layed vpon his bedde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He went in therefore, and shut the doore vpon them twayne, and prayed vnto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he went up, and  lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed  seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he called Gehazi, and sayd, Call this Shunammite. So he called her, which came in vnto him; he said vnto her, Take thy sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she came, and fell at his feete, and bowed her selfe to the ground, and tooke vp her sonne, and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and [there was] a dearth in the  land; and the sons of the prophets [were] sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a  wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred [them] into the pot of pottage: for they knew [them] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O [thou] man of God, [there is]  death in the pot. And they could not eat [thereof].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he said, Bring meale; hee cast it into the potte, and sayd, Powre out for the people, that they may eate: and there was none euill in the pot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then came a man from Baal-shalisha, & brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, euen twenty loaues of barley, and full eares of corne in the huske; hee saide, Giue vnto the people, that they may eate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and  shall leave [thereof].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he set it before them, and they did eate, and left ouer, according to the word of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
