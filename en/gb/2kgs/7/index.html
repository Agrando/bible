And he said, Behold, thou shalt see [it] with thine eyes, but shalt not  eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And there were four leprous men at the  entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If we say, We will enter into the citie, the famine is in the citie, and we shall die there: and if we sit here, we dye also. Nowe therefore come, and let vs fall into the campe of the Aramites: if they saue our liues, we shall liue: and if they kill vs, we are but dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they rose vp in the twilight, to goe to the campe of the Aramites: and when they were come to the vtmost part of the campe of the Aramites, loe, there was no man there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a  noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, [even] the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it [was], and  fled for their life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when these lepers came to the vtmost part of the campe, they entred into one tent, and did eate and drinke, and caryed thence siluer and golde, and raiment, and went and hid it: after they returned, and entred into another tent, and caryed thence also, and went and hid it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then saide one to another, We doe not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we holde our peace. If we tary till day light, some mischiefe will come vpon vs. Nowe therefore, come, let vs goe, and tell the Kings housholde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they came, and called vnto the porters of the citie, and tolde them, saying, We came to the campe of the Aramites, and loe, there was no man there, neither voyce of man, but horses tyed and asses tyed: and the tents are as they were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the porters cryed and declared to the Kings house within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants,  I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we [be] hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one of his servants answered and said, Let [some] take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they [are] as all the  multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, [I say], they [are] even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So they tooke two charets of horses, and the King sent after the hoste of the Aramites, saying, Goe and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they went after them vnto Iorden, and loe, all the way was full of clothes and vessels which the Aramites had cast from them in their hast: & the messengers returned, and told ye King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,  according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people  trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to passe, as the man of God had spoken to the King, saying, Two measures of barley at a shekel, and a measure of fine floure shall be at a shekel, to morowe about this time in the gate of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the prince had answered the man of God, and saide, Though the Lorde would make windowes in the heauen, coulde it come so to passe? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eate thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so it came vnto him: for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he dyed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
