And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's [children], saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Nowe when this letter commeth to you, (for ye haue with you your masters sonnes, yee haue with you both charets and horses, and a defenced citie, and armour)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and  set [him] on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they were exceedingly afraid, and saide, Behold two Kings coulde not stande before him, how shall we then stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he that was gouernour of Ahabs house, and he that ruled the citie, and the Elders, & the bringers vp of the children sent to Iehu, saying, We are thy seruants, and will doe all that thou shalt bid vs: we will make no King: do what seemeth good to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye [be] mine, and [if] ye will hearken unto my voice,  take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, [being] seventy persons, [were] with the great men of the city, which brought them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the letter came to them, they tooke the Kings sonnes, and slewe the seuentie persons, and layde their heads in baskets, and sent them vnto him to Izreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then there came a messenger and tolde him, saying, They haue brought the heads of the Kings sonnes; he sayd, Let them lay them on two heapes at the entring in of the gate vntil the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye [be]  righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Knowe nowe that there shal fall vnto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord, which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the Lorde hath brought to passe the things that hee spake by his seruant Eliiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his  priests, until he left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he arose, and departed and came to Samaria. And as Iehu was in the way by an house where the shepheards did shere,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He met with the brethre of Ahaziah king of Iudah, and sayd, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah, and goe downe to salute the children of the King and the children of the Queene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, [even] two and forty men;  neither left he any of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab [coming] to meet him: and he  saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart [is] with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give [me] thine hand. And he gave [him] his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he sayde, Come with me, and see the zeale that I haue for the Lord: so they made him ride in his charet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained vnto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the worde of the Lord, which he spake to Eliiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served  Baal a little; [but] Jehu shall serve him much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore call vnto me all ye prophets of Baal, all his seruants, & all his priests, & let not a man be lacking: for I haue a great sacrifice for Baal: whosoeuer is lacking, he shal not liue. But Iehu did it by a subtiltie to destroy ye seruats of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Iehu sayd, Proclaime a solemne assemblie for Baal; they proclaimed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Iehu sent vnto all Israel, and all the seruants of Baal came, and there was not a man left that came not; they came into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was full from ende to ende.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he said vnto him that had the charge of the vestrie, Bring forth vestments for al the seruants of Baal; he brought the out vestments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the  servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they went in to make sacrifice and burnt offering, Iehu appoynted foure score men without, and sayd, If any of the men whome I haue brought into your hands, escape, his soule shalbe for his soule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, [and] slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast [them] out, and went to the  city of the house of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they brought out the images of the temple of Baal, and burnt them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they destroyed the image of Baal, and threwe downe the house of Baal, & made a iakes of it vnto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Iehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But fro the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat which made Israel to sinne, Iehu departed not fro them, neither from the golden calues that were in Beth-el and that were in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing [that which is] right in mine eyes, [and] hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that [was] in mine heart, thy  children of the fourth [generation] shall sit on the throne of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Iehu regarded not to walke in the law of the Lorde God of Israel with all his heart: for hee departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam, which made Israel to sinne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In those dayes the Lorde began to lothe Israel, and Hazael smote them in all the coastes of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>From Iorden Eastward, euen all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, & them that were of Manasseh, from Aroer (which is by the riuer Arnon) and Gilead and Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Concerning the rest of the actes of Iehu, and all that he did, and all his valiant deedes, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Iehu slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in Samaria, and Iehoahaz his sonne reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the time that Iehu reigned ouer Israel in Samaria is eight and twentie yeeres.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
