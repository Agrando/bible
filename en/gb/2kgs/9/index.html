Then open the doore, and flee without any tarying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the seruat of ye Prophet gate him to Ramoth Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he came in, behold, the captaines of the armie were sitting; he sayde, I haue a message to thee, O captaine; Iehu sayd, Vnto which of all vs? And he answered, To thee, O captaine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have  anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, [even] over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may auenge the blood of my seruants the Prophets, and the blood of al the seruants of the Lord of the hand of Iezebel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the whole house of Ahab shalbe destroied: and I will cut off from Ahab, him that maketh water against the wall, as well him that is shut vp, as him that is left in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the dogges shall eate Iezebel in the fielde of Izreel, and there shalbe none to burie her; he opened the doore, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jehu came forth to the  servants of his lord: and [one] said unto him, [Is] all well? wherefore came this  mad [fellow] to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they sayde, It is false, tell vs it nowe. Then he sayd, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saieth the Lorde, I haue anointed thee for King ouer Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they made haste, and tooke euerie man his garment, and put it vnder him on the top of the staires, and blewe the trumpet, saying, Iehu is King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Iehu ye sonne of Iehoshaphat the sonne of Nimshi conspired against Ioram: (Now Ioram kept Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael King of Aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And King Ioram returned to bee healed in Izreel of the woundes, which the Aramites had giuen him, when hee fought with Hazael King of Aram) and Iehu sayde, If it be your mindes, let no man depart and escape out of the citie, to goe and tell in Izreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And  Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the watchman that stoode in the towre in Izreel spyed the companie of Iehu as hee came, & sayd, I see a companie; Iehoram said, Take a horseman and send to meete them, that hee may say, Is it peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So there went one on horseback to meete him, and sayde, Thus sayth the King, Is it peace? And Iehu sayd, What hast thou to do with peace? Turne behinde me; the watchman tolde, saying, The messenger came to them, but he commeth not againe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then hee sent out another on horsebacke, which came to them, and sayde, Thus sayth the King, Is it peace? And Iehu answered, What hast thou to doe with peace? turne behinde me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving [is] like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth  furiously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Iehoram sayd, Make ready: and his charet was made ready; Iehoram King of Israel and Ahaziah King of Iudah went out eyther of them in his charet against Iehu, and met him in the fielde of Naboth the Izreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, [Is it]  peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts [are so] many?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Iehoram turned his hand, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, O Ahaziah, there is treason.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Iehu tooke a bowe in his hande, and smote Iehoram betweene the shoulders, that the arowe went through his heart: and he fell downe in his charet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said Iehu to Bidkar a captaine, Take, and cast him in some place of the fielde of Naboth the Izreelite: for I remember that when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the Lorde layed this burden vpon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his  sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take [and] cast him into the plat [of ground], according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw [this], he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. [And they did so] at the going up to Gur, which [is] by Ibleam. And he fled to  Megiddo, and died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And his seruants caried him in a charet to Ierusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the citie of Dauid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And in the  eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard [of it]; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and  looked out at a window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, [Had]  Zimri peace, who slew his master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he lift vp his eyes to the windowe, and sayd, Who is on my side, who? Then two or three of her Eunuches looked vnto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down:  and [some] of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed [woman], and bury her: for she [is] a  king's daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they went to burie her, but they foud no more of her, then the skull and the feete, and the palmes of her handes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Wherefore they came agayne and tolde him; he said, This is the worde of the Lorde, which he spake by his seruant Eliiah the Tishbite, saying, In the fielde of Izreel shall ye dogs eate the flesh of Iezebel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; [so] that they shall not say,  This [is] Jezebel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
