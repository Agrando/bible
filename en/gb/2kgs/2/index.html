But Elisha said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came downe to Beth-el.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the  sons of the prophets that [were] at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from  thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I  know [it]; hold ye your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Againe Eliiah saide vnto him, Elisha, tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lorde hath sent me to Iericho: But he said, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came to Iericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of the prophets that [were] at  Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know [it]; hold ye your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moreouer Eliiah saide vnto him, Tarie, I pray thee, here: for the Lorde hath sent me to Iorden. But he saide, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they went both together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And fiftie men of the sonnes of the Prophets went and stoode on the other side a farre off, and they two stoode by Iorden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped [it] together, and smote the  waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee,  let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saide, Thou hast asked an hard thing: yet if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt haue it so: & if not, it shal not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into  heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elisha saw it, and he cryed, My father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof: and he sawe him no more: and he tooke his owne clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He tooke vp also the cloke of Eliiah that fell from him, and returned, and stoode by the banke of Iorden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After, he tooke the cloke of Eliiah, that fell from him, and smote the waters, and sayde, Where is the Lord God of Eliiah? And so he also, after he had striken the waters, so that they were deuided this way and that way, went ouer, euen Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of the prophets which [were] to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The  spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said,  Ye shall not send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet they were instant vpon him, til he was ashamed: wherefore he saide, Sende. So they sent fiftie men, which sought three dayes, but founde him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore they returned to him, (for he taryed at Iericho) and he said vnto them, Did not I say vnto you, Goe not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the men of the citie saide vnto Elisha, Beholde, we pray thee: the situation of this citie is pleasant, as thou, my lorde, seest, but the water is naught, and the ground baren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he saide, Bring me a newe cruse, and put salt therein; they brought it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast  the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren [land].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the waters were healed vntill this day, according to the worde of Elisha which hee had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went vp from thence vnto Beth-el; as he was going vp the way, litle children came out of the citie, and mocked him, and saide vnto him, Come vp, thou balde head, come vp, thou balde head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned back, and looked on them, and  cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
