His mothers name also was Iedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozcath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, and  walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in the eighteenth yeere of King Iosiah, the King sent Shaphan the sonne of Azaliah the sonne of Meshullam the chanceller to ye house of the Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the  door have gathered of the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And let  them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which [is] in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>To wit, vnto the artificers and carpenters & masons, and to bye timber, and hewed stone to repaire the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt  faithfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the  book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Shaphan the chanceller came to ye King, and brought him word againe, and saide, Thy seruants haue gathered the money, that was found in the house, and haue deliuered it vnto the hands of them that doe the worke, and haue the ouersight of the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also Shaphan the chanceller shewed the King saying, Hilkiah the Priest hath deliuered me a booke; Shaphan read it before the King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the King had heard the wordes of the booke of the Law, he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore the King commaunded Hilkiah the Priest, & Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan, and Achbor the sonne of Michaiah, and Shaphan the chanceller, and Asahiah the Kings seruant, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go ye,  enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the  college;) and they communed with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And shee answered them, Thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel, Tel the man that sent you to mee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus sayth the Lorde, Behold, I wil bring euill vpon this place, & on the inhabitants thereof, euen al the words of the booke which ye King of Iudah hath read,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the  works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But to the King of Iudah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, so shal ye say vnto him, Thus sayeth the Lorde God of Israel, The wordes that thou hast heard, shal come to passe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because thine heart was  tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard [thee], saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in  peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
