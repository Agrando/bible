And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this [is] the woman, and this [is] her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that [was] hers, and all the  fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-hadad the King of Aram was sicke, and one told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king sayd vnto Hazael, Take a present in thine hande, and goe meete the man of God, that thou mayest inquire of ye Lord by him, saying, Shall I recouer of this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every  good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly  recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And hee looked vpon him stedfastly, till Hazael was ashamed, and the man of God wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hazael sayde, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I knowe the euill that thou shalt do vnto the children of Israel: for their strong cities shalt thou set on fire, and their yong men shalt thou slay with the sworde, and shalt dash their infantes against the stones, and rent in pieces their women with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hazael said, But what, [is] thy servant  a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou [shalt be] king over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What saide Elisha to thee? And he answered, Hee tolde mee that thou shouldest recouer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped [it] in water, and  spread [it] on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat [being] then king of Judah,  Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He was two and thirtie yere olde, when he began to reigne: and hee reigned eight yeere in Ierusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the  daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet the Lord would not destroy Iudah, for Dauid his seruants sake, as he had promised him to giue him a light, and to his children for euer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In his days Edom  revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore Ioram went to Zair, and all his charets with him, and he arose by night, & smote the Edomites which were about him with the captains of the charets, and the people fled into their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then  Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Concerning the rest of the actes of Ioram and all that hee did, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Ioram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid; Ahaziah his sonne reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the twelft yere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab King of Israel did Ahaziah the sonne of Iehoram King of Iudah begin to reigne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Two and twenty years old [was] Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did euill in the sight of the Lord, like the house of Ahab: for hee was the sonne in law of the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in  Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And king Joram went back to be healed in  Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
