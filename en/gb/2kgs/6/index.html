And he answered, Go ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And one said, Vouchsafe, I pray thee, to go with thy seruants, and he answered, I will goe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So he went with them, & when they came to Iorden, they cut downe wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And as one was felling of a tree, the yron fell into the water: then he cryed, and said, Alas master, it was but borowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast [it] in thither; and the iron did  swim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he saide, Take it vp to thee; he stretched out his hand, and tooke it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In  such and such a place [shall be] my camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore the man of God sent vnto the King of Israel, saying, Beware thou goe not ouer to such a place: for there the Aramites are come downe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and  saved himself there, not once nor twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the heart of the King of Aram was troubled for this thing: therefore he called his seruants and saide vnto them, Will ye not shewe me, which of vs bewrayeth our counsel to the king of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that [is] in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy  bedchamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, Goe, and espie where he is, that I may sende and fetch him; one tolde him, saying, Beholde, he is in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a  great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the seruant of the man of God arose earely to goe out, beholde, an hoste compassed the citie with horses and charets. Then his seruant sayde vnto him, Alas master, howe shall we doe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he answered,  Fear not: for they that [be] with us [are] more than they that [be] with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,  that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain [was] full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when  they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Elisha said unto them, This [is] not the way, neither [is] this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led  them to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they were come to Samaria, Elisha saide, Lorde, open their eyes that they may see; the Lorde opened their eyes, and they saw, & beholde, they were in the mids of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them,  My father, shall I smite [them]? shall I smite [them]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: doest thou not smite them that thou hast taken with thy sworde, and with thy bowe? but set bread and water before them, that they may eate and drinke and goe to their master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no  more into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But afterward Ben-hadad King of Aram gathered all his hoste, and went vp, and besieged Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was [sold] for fourscore [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's  dung for five [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as the King of Israel was going vpon the wall, there cryed a woman vnto him, saying, Helpe, my lord, O King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the  barnfloor, or out of the winepress?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Also the King said vnto her, What ayleth thee? And she answered, This woman sayde vnto me, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him to day, and we will eate my sonne to morowe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So we sod my sonne, and did eate him: & I saide to her the day after, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him, but she hath hid her sonne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, [he had] sackcloth within  upon his flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he saide, God doe so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the sonne of Shaphat shall stande on him this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a  murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: [is] not the sound of his master's feet behind him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil [is] of the LORD; what  should I wait for the LORD any longer?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
