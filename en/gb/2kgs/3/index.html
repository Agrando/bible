And he said, I will go up:  I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, [and] my horses as thy horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said he, What way shall we goe vp? And he answered, The way of the wildernesse of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the  king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore the King of Israel sayde, Alas, that the Lord hath called these three Kings, to giue them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here [is] Elisha the son of Shaphat, which  poured water on the hands of Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehoshaphat said,  The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elisha said unto the king of Israel,  What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him,  Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Elisha said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would  not look toward thee, nor see thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel  played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saide, Thus saith the Lorde, Make this valley full of ditches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus saith the Lorde, Ye shall neither see winde nor see raine, yet the valley shalbe filled with water, that ye may drinke, both ye and your cattel, and your beastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this is [but] a  light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and  mar every good piece of land with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in the morning whe the meat offring was offred, beholde, there came water by the way of Edom: and the countrey was filled with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when al the Moabites heard that the Kings were come vp to fight against them, they gathered all that was able to put on harnesse, & vpwarde, and stood in their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they rose earely in the morning, when the sunne arose vpon the water, and the Moabites saw the water ouer against them, as red as blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they said,  This [is] blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they  went forward smiting the Moabites, even in [their] country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in  Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about [it], and smote it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the King of Moab saw that the battel was too sore for him, he tooke with him seuen hudreth men that drew the sword, to break through vnto the King of Edom: but they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and  offered him [for] a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to [their own] land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
