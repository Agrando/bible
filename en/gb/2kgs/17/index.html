and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the children of Israel walked in all the sinnes of Ieroboam, which he did, and departed not therefrom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Vntill the Lord put Israel away out of his sight, as he had said by all his seruants the Prophets, and caryed Israel away out of their land to Asshur vnto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king of Assyria brought [men] from Babylon, and from  Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed [them] in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And [so] it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, [that] they  feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew [some] of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wherefore they spake to the King of Asshur, saying, The nations which thou hast remoued, and placed in the cities of Samaria, knowe not the maner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they knowe not the maner of the God of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God  of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So one of the Priestes, which they had caryed from Samaria, came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they shoulde feare the Lorde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Howbeit euery nation made their gods, & put them in the houses of the hie places, which the Samaritanes had made, euery nation in their cities, wherein they dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the men of Babylon made  Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Auims made Nibhaz, and Tartak: and the Sepharuims burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech, and Anammelech the gods of Sepharuaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus they feared the Lorde, and appoynted out Priestes out of them selues for the hie places, who prepared for them sacrifices in the houses of the hie places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They  feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after  their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And with whom the Lord had made a couenant, and charged them, saying, Feare none other gods, nor bowe your selues to them, nor serue them, nor sacrifice to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But feare the Lorde which brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power, and a stretched out arme: him feare ye, and worshippe him, and sacrifice to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also keepe ye diligently the statutes and the ordinances, and the Lawe, and the commandement, which he wrote for you, that ye do them continually, and feare not other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And forget not the couenant that I haue made with you, neither feare ye other gods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But feare the Lord your God, and he will deliuer you out of the handes of all your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Howbeit they obeyed not, but did after their olde custome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So these  nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
