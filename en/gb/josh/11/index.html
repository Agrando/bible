and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Ioshua did vnto them as the Lorde bade him: he houghed their horses, & burnt their charets with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>At that time also Ioshua turned backe, and tooke Hazor, & smote the King thereof with the sword: for Hazor before time was the head of all those kingdomes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they smote all the  souls that [were] therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying [them]: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So all ye cities of those Kings, & all the kings of them did Ioshua take, & smote them with the edge of the sword, and vtterly destroyed them, as Moses the seruant of the Lord had commaunded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But [as for] the cities that stood still in their  strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; [that] did Joshua burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every  man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the Lorde had commaunded Moses his seruant, so did Moses commande Ioshua, and so did Ioshua: he left nothing vndone of all that the Lord had commaunded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the  mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Even] from the mount  Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Ioshua made warre long time with all those Kings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Neither was there any citie that made peace with the children of Israel, saue those Hiuites that inhabited Gibeon: all other they tooke by battell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it was of the LORD to  harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, [and] that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And that same season came Ioshua, and destroyed the Anakims out of the mountaines: as out of Hebron, out of Debir, out of Anab, and out of all the mountaines of Iudah, and out of all the mountaines of Israel: Ioshua destroyed them vtterly with their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza,  in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Ioshua tooke the whole land, according to all that the Lorde had saide vnto Moses: and Ioshua gaue it for an inheritance vnto Israel according to their portion through their tribes: then the land was at rest without warre.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
