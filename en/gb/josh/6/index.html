Thus shalt thou do six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of  rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when they make a long blast with the rams horne, and ye heare the sound of the trumpet, al the people shal shoute with a great shoute: then shall the wall of the citie fall downe flat, and the people shall ascend vp, euery man streight before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then, Ioshua the sonne of Nun called the Priests & said vnto them, Take vp the Arke of the couenant, and let seuen Priests beare seuen trumpets of rams hornes before the Arke of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said unto the people,  Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when Ioshua had spoken vnto the people, the seuen Priestes bare the seuen trumpets of rams hornes, and went foorth before the Arke of the Lorde, and blew with the trumpets, & the Arke of the couenant of ye Lord followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the  rereward came after the ark, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(Nowe Ioshua had commaunded the people, saying, Ye shall nor shout, neither make any noyse with your voyce, neither shall a worde proceede out of your mouth, vntill the day that I say vnto you, Shout, then shall ye shoute)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about [it]  once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Ioshua rose early in the morning, and the Priestes bare the Arke of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the  rereward came after the ark of the LORD, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the second day they compassed the citie once, and returned into the host: thus they did sixe dayes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner  seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the Priests had blowen ye trumpets the seuenth time, Ioshua said vnto ye people, Shoute: for the Lord hath giuen you the citie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the city shall be  accursed, [even] it, and all that [are] therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that [are] with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Notwithstanding, be ye ware of the execrable thing, lest ye make your selues execrable, and in taking of the execrable thing, make also the hoste of Israel execrable, and trouble it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, [are]  consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the people shouted, whe they had blowen trumpets: for when the people had heard the sound of the trumpet, they shouted with a great shoute: and the wall fel downe flat: so the people went vp into the citie, euery man streight before him: and they tooke the citie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they vtterly destroyed all that was in the citie, both man and woman, yong, and olde, and oxe, and sheepe, and asse, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Ioshua had said vnto the two men that had spied out the countrey, Go into the harlots house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them  without the camp of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that [was] therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the  house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she  dwelleth in Israel [even] unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua adjured [them] at that time, saying, Cursed [be] the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho:  he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest [son] shall he set up the gates of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the Lord was with Ioshua, and he was famous through all the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
