and they presented themselves before  God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the  flood in old time, [even] Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I tooke your father Abraham from beyond the flood, and brought him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seede, and gaue him Izhak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I gaue vnto Izhak, Iaakob and Esau: and I gaue vnto Esau mount Seir, to possesse it: but Iaakob and his children went downe into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I sent Moses also & Aaron, and I plagued Egypt: and when I had so done among them, I brought you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came vnto the Sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with charets and horsemen vnto the red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a  long season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>After, I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt beyond Iorden, and they fought with you: but I gaue them into your hand, and ye possessed their countrey, and I destroyed them out of your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also Balak the sonne of Zippor King of Moab arose and warred against Israel, and sent to call Balaam the sonne of Beor for to curse you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I would not heare Balaam: therefore he blessed you, and I deliuered you out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the  men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I sent hornets before you, which cast them out before you, euen the two kings of the Amorites, and not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I haue giuen you a land, wherein ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and yee dwell in them, and eate of the vineyards and oliue trees, which yee planted not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now therefore  fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that [were] on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell:  but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the people answered and saide, God forbid, that we shoulde forsake the Lord, to serue other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Lorde our God, he brought vs and our fathers out of the lande of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and he did those great miracles in our sight, and preserued vs in all the way that we went, and among all the people through whome we came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: [therefore] will we also serve the LORD;  for he [is] our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Ioshua saide vnto the people, Ye can not serue the Lorde: for he is an holie God: he is a ielous God: hee will not pardon your iniquitie nor your sinnes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If yee forsake the Lorde and serue strange gods, then he will returne and bring euill vpon you, and consume you, after that hee hath done you good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people saide vnto Ioshua, Nay, but we will serue the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye [are] witnesses  against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, [We are] witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore put away, [said he], the strange  gods which [are] among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And ye people saide vnto Ioshua, The Lord our God wil we serue, & his voyce wil we obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Joshua  made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ioshua wrote these woordes in the booke of the Lawe of God, and tooke a great stone, and pitched it there vnder an oke that was in the Sanctuarie of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it  hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Ioshua let the people depart, euery man vnto his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And after these things Ioshua the sonne of Nun, the seruaunt of the Lord died, being an hundreth and ten yeeres olde.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they buried him in ye border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the Northside of mount Gaash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel  served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the bones of Ioseph, which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in a parcell of ground which Iaakob bought of the sonnes of Hamor the father of Shechem, for an hundreth pieces of siluer, and the children of Ioseph had them in their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Also Eleazar the sonne of Aaron died, whome they buried in the hill of Phinehas his sonne, which was giuen him in mount Ephraim.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
