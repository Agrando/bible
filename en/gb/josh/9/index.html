Then Ioshua saide vnto them, Who are ye? And whence come ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of  the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all that he hath done to the two Kings of the Amorites that were beyonde Iorden, to Sihon King of Heshbon, & to Og King of Bashan, which were at Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our countrey spake to vs, saying, Take vitailes with you for the iourney, and go to meete them, and say vnto them, Wee are your seruants: now therefore make ye a league with vs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This our  bread we took hot [for] our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also these bottels of wine which we filled, were newe, and lo, they be rent, and these our garments and our shooes are olde, by reason of the exceeding great iourney.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the  men took of their victuals, and asked not [counsel] at the mouth of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Ioshua made peace with them, & made a league with them, that he would suffer them to liue: also the Princes of the Congregation sware vnto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But at the end of three dayes, after they had made a league with them, they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel  journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day.
