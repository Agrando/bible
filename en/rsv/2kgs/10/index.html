So Jehu wrote letters, and sent them to Sama'ria, to the rulers of the city, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"Now then, as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and weapons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>select the best and fittest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, "Behold, the two kings could not stand before him; how then can we stand?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he who was over the palace, and he who was over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, sent to Jehu, saying, "We are your servants, and we will do all that you bid us. We will not make any one king; do whatever is good in your eyes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master's sons, and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time." Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were bringing them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the letter came to them, they took the king's sons, and slew them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the messenger came and told him, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons," he said, "Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then in the morning, when he went out, he stood, and said to all the people, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master, and slew him; but who struck down all these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD has done what he said by his servant Eli'jah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he set out and went to Sama'ria. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehu met the kinsmen of Ahazi'ah king of Judah, and he said, "Who are you?" And they answered, "We are the kinsmen of Ahazi'ah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said, "Take them alive." And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons, and he spared none of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he departed from there, he met Jehon'adab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him, and said to him, "Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?" And Jehon'adab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." So he gave him his hand. And Jehu took him up with him into the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, "Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD." So he had him ride in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he came to Sama'ria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Sama'ria, till he had wiped them out, according to the word of the LORD which he spoke to Eli'jah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jehu assembled all the people, and said to them, "Ahab served Ba'al a little; but Jehu will serve him much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Ba'al, all his worshipers and all his priests; let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Ba'al; whoever is missing shall not live." But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Ba'al.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehu ordered, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Ba'al." So they proclaimed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Ba'al came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they entered the house of Ba'al, and the house of Ba'al was filled from one end to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He said to him who was in charge of the wardrobe, "Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Ba'al." So he brought out the vestments for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jehu went into the house of Ba'al with Jehon'adab the son of Rechab; and he said to the worshipers of Ba'al, "Search, and see that there is no servant of the LORD here among you, but only the worshipers of Ba'al."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.  Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, and said, "The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape shall forfeit his life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the officers, "Go in and slay them; let not a man escape." So when they put them to the sword, the guard and the officers cast them out and went into the inner room of the house of Ba'al</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and they brought out the pillar that was in the house of Ba'al, and burned it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they demolished the pillar of Ba'al, and demolished the house of Ba'al, and made it a latrine to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus Jehu wiped out Ba'al from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD the God of Israel with all his heart; he did not turn from the sins of Jerobo'am, which he made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In those days the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel. Haz'ael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manas'sites, from Aro'er, which is by the valley of the Arnon, that is, Gilead and Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Sama'ria. And Jeho'ahaz his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Sama'ria was twenty-eight years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
