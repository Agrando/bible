And they went in the direction of the Arabah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the army of the Chalde'ans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they captured the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, who passed sentence upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They slew the sons of Zedeki'ah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedeki'ah, and bound him in fetters, and took him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month--which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnez'zar, king of Babylon--Nebu'zarad'an, the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the army of the Chalde'ans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the multitude, Nebu'zarad'an the captain of the guard carried into exile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chalde'ans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>the firepans also, and the bowls. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands, which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the capital was three cubits; a network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were upon the capital round about. And the second pillar had the like, with the network.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the captain of the guard took Serai'ah the chief priest, and Zephani'ah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and five men of the king's council who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Nebu'zarad'an the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnez'zar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedali'ah the son of Ahi'kam, son of Shaphan, governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedali'ah governor, they came with their men to Gedali'ah at Mizpah, namely, Ish'mael the son of Nethani'ah, and Joha'nan the son of Kare'ah, and Serai'ah the son of Tanhu'meth the Netoph'athite, and Ja-azani'ah the son of the Ma-ac'athite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gedali'ah swore to them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid because of the Chalde'an officials; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But in the seventh month, Ish'mael the son of Nethani'ah, son of Eli'shama, of the royal family, came with ten men, and attacked and killed Gedali'ah and the Jews and the Chalde'ans who were with him at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose, and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chalde'ans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoi'achin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evil-mero'dach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, graciously freed Jehoi'achin king of Judah from prison;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So Jehoi'achin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, every day a portion, as long as he lived.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
