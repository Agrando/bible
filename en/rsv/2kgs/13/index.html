The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Eli'sha said to him, "Take a bow and arrows"; so he took a bow and arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he said to the king of Israel, "Draw the bow"; and he drew it. And Eli'sha laid his hands upon the king's hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, "Open the window eastward"; and he opened it. Then Eli'sha said, "Shoot"; and he shot. And he said, "The LORD's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria! For you shall fight the Syrians in Aphek until you have made an end of them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, "Take the arrows"; and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground with them"; and he struck three times, and stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the man of God was angry with him, and said, "You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Syria only three times."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Eli'sha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as a man was being buried, lo, a marauding band was seen and the man was cast into the grave of Eli'sha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Eli'sha, he revived, and stood on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Haz'ael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jeho'ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them, and he turned toward them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them; nor has he cast them from his presence until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When Haz'ael king of Syria died, Ben-ha'dad his son became king in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jeho'ash the son of Jeho'ahaz took again from Ben-ha'dad the son of Haz'ael the cities which he had taken from Jeho'ahaz his father in war. Three times Jo'ash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
