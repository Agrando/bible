Then open the door and flee; do not tarry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in council; and he said, "I have an errand to you, O commander." And Jehu said, "To which of us all?" And he said, "To you, O commander."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he arose, and went into the house; and the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, "Thus says the LORD the God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge on Jez'ebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba'asha the son of Ahi'jah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the dogs shall eat Jez'ebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her." Then he opened the door, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him, "Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?" And he said to them, "You know the fellow and his talk."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said, "That is not true; tell us now." And he said, "Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, `Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then in haste every man of them took his garment, and put it under him on the bare steps, and they blew the trumpet, and proclaimed, "Jehu is king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus Jehu the son of Jehosh'aphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against Haz'ael king of Syria;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Haz'ael king of Syria.) So Jehu said, "If this is your mind, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Jehu mounted his chariot, and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahazi'ah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, "I see a company." And Joram said, "Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, `Is it peace?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So a man on horseback went to meet him, and said, "Thus says the king, `Is it peace?'" And Jehu said, "What have you to do with peace? Turn round and ride behind me." And the watchman reported, saying, "The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them, and said, "Thus the king has said, `Is it peace?'" And Jehu answered, "What have you to do with peace? Turn round and ride behind me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again the watchman reported, "He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Joram said, "Make ready." And they made ready his chariot. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahazi'ah king of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu, and met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" He answered, "What peace can there be, so long as the harlotries and the sorceries of your mother Jez'ebel are so many?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahazi'ah, "Treachery, O Ahazi'ah!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, "Take him up, and cast him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how the LORD uttered this oracle against him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons--says the LORD--I will requite you on this plot of ground.' Now therefore take him up and cast him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When Ahazi'ah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him, and said, "Shoot him also"; and they shot him in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megid'do, and died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahazi'ah began to reign over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jez'ebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out of the window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down; and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then he went in and ate and drank; and he said, "See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When they came back and told him, he said, "This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Eli'jah the Tishbite, `In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jez'ebel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and the corpse of Jez'ebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is Jez'ebel.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
