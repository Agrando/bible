They built for themselves high places at all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>they set up for themselves pillars and Ashe'rim on every high hill and under every green tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and there they burned incense on all the high places, as the nations did whom the LORD carried away before them. And they did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, "You shall not do this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But they would not listen, but were stubborn, as their fathers had been, who did not believe in the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They despised his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and the warnings which he gave them. They went after false idols, and became false, and they followed the nations that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had commanded them that they should not do like them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they forsook all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves molten images of two calves; and they made an Ashe'rah, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Ba'al.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings, and used divination and sorcery, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the customs which Israel had introduced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel, and afflicted them, and gave them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When he had torn Israel from the house of David they made Jerobo'am the son of Nebat king. And Jerobo'am drove Israel from following the LORD and made them commit great sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The people of Israel walked in all the sins which Jerobo'am did; they did not depart from them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had spoken by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their own land to Assyria until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sephar-va'im, and placed them in the cities of Sama'ria instead of the people of Israel; and they took possession of Sama'ria, and dwelt in its cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the king of Assyria was told, "The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Sama'ria do not know the law of the god of the land; therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the king of Assyria commanded, "Send there one of the priests whom you carried away thence; and let him go and dwell there, and teach them the law of the god of the land."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Sama'ria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But every nation still made gods of its own, and put them in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities in which they dwelt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the men of Babylon made Suc'coth-be'noth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashi'ma,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the Av'vites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sephar'vites burned their children in the fire to Adram'melech and Anam'melech, the gods of Sephar-va'im.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They also feared the LORD, and appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they feared the LORD but also served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>To this day they do according to the former manner.  They do not fear the LORD, and they do not follow the statutes or the ordinances or the law or the commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The LORD made a covenant with them, and commanded them, "You shall not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>but you shall fear the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm; you shall bow yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to do. You shall not fear other gods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>However they would not listen, but they did according to their former manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So these nations feared the LORD, and also served their graven images; their children likewise, and their children's children--as their fathers did, so they do to this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
