His mother's name was Jedi'dah the daughter of Adai'ah of Bozkath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the eighteenth year of King Josi'ah, the king sent Shaphan the son of Azali'ah, son of Meshul'lam, the secretary, to the house of the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Go up to Hilki'ah the high priest, that he may reckon the amount of the money which has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and let it be given into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD; and let them give it to the workmen who are at the house of the LORD, repairing the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that is, to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, as well as for buying timber and quarried stone to repair the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But no accounting shall be asked from them for the money which is delivered into their hand, for they deal honestly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hilki'ah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD." And Hilki'ah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Shaphan the secretary came to the king, and reported to the king, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, "Hilki'ah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the king heard the words of the book of the law, he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king commanded Hilki'ah the priest, and Ahi'kam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micai'ah, and Shaphan the secretary, and Asai'ah the king's servant, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Hilki'ah the priest, and Ahi'kam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asai'ah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they talked with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: `Tell the man who sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words which you have heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard how I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have rent your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.'"
