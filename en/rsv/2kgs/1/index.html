So Eli'jah went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, "Why have you returned?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they said to him, "There came a man to meet us, and said to us, `Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Ba'al-ze'bub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone, but shall surely die.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said to them, "What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They answered him, "He wore a garment of haircloth, with a girdle of leather about his loins." And he said, "It is Eli'jah the Tishbite."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Eli'jah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "O man of God, the king says, `Come down.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Eli'jah answered the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he went up and said to him, "O man of God, this is the king's order, `Come down quickly!'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Eli'jah answered them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Eli'jah, and entreated him, "O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Lo, fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the angel of the LORD said to Eli'jah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So he arose and went down with him to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, `Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Ba'al-ze'bub, the god of Ekron,--is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?--therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Eli'jah had spoken. Jeho'ram, his brother, became king in his stead in the second year of Jeho'ram the son of Jehosh'aphat, king of Judah, because Ahazi'ah had no son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahazi'ah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
