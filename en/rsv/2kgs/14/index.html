His mother's name was Jeho-ad'din of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not like David his father; he did in all things as Jo'ash his father had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants who had slain the king his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he did not put to death the children of the murderers; according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, or the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He killed ten thousand E'domites in the Valley of Salt and took Sela by storm, and called it Jok'the-el, which is its name to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Amazi'ah sent messengers to Jeho'ash the son of Jeho'ahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jeho'ash king of Israel sent word to Amazi'ah king of Judah, "A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, `Give your daughter to my son for a wife'; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have indeed smitten Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Amazi'ah would not listen. So Jeho'ash king of Israel went up, and he and Amazi'ah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-she'mesh, which belongs to Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jeho'ash king of Israel captured Amazi'ah king of Judah, the son of Jeho'ash, son of Ahazi'ah, at Beth-she'mesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the E'phraim Gate to the Corner Gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house, also hostages, and he returned to Sama'ria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jeho'ash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amazi'ah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jeho'ash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Sama'ria with the kings of Israel; and Jerobo'am his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Amazi'ah the son of Jo'ash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jeho'ash son of Jeho'ahaz, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the deeds of Amazi'ah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the people of Judah took Azari'ah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amazi'ah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the fifteenth year of Amazi'ah the son of Jo'ash, king of Judah, Jerobo'am the son of Jo'ash, king of Israel, began to reign in Sama'ria, and he reigned forty-one years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the son of Amit'tai, the prophet, who was from Gath-he'pher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the LORD saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, for there was none left, bond or free, and there was none to help Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the LORD had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, so he saved them by the hand of Jerobo'am the son of Jo'ash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jerobo'am, and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered for Israel Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jerobo'am slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel, and Zechari'ah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
