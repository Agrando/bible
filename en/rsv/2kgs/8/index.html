And Geha'zi said, "My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Eli'sha restored to life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, "Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Eli'sha came to Damascus. Ben-ha'dad the king of Syria was sick; and when it was told him, "The man of God has come here,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the king said to Haz'ael, "Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD through him, saying, `Shall I recover from this sickness?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Haz'ael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camel loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, "Your son Ben-ha'dad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, `Shall I recover from this sickness?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Eli'sha said to him, "Go, say to him, `You shall certainly recover'; but the LORD has shown me that he shall certainly die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was ashamed. And the man of God wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Haz'ael said, "Why does my lord weep?" He answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel; you will set on fire their fortresses, and you will slay their young men with the sword, and dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Haz'ael said, "What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Eli'sha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you are to be king over Syria."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he departed from Eli'sha, and came to his master, who said to him, "What did Eli'sha say to you?" And he answered, "He told me that you would certainly recover."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But on the morrow he took the coverlet and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died. And Haz'ael became king in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jeho'ram the son of Jehosh'aphat, king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, since he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah, and set up a king of their own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Joram passed over to Za'ir with all his chariots, and rose by night, and he and his chariot commanders smote the E'domites who had surrounded him; but his army fled home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahazi'ah his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahazi'ah the son of Jeho'ram, king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ahazi'ah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athali'ah; she was a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He also walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was son-in-law to the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He went with Joram the son of Ahab to make war against Haz'ael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, where the Syrians wounded Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Haz'ael king of Syria. And Ahazi'ah the son of Jeho'ram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
