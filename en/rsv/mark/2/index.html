It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you question thus in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise, take up your pallet and walk'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd gathered about him, and he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as he passed on, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as he sat at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, "Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>how he entered the house of God, when Abi'athar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, "The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
