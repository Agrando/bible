How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus asked his father, "How long has he had this?" And he said, "From childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said to him, "If you can! All things are possible to him who believes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said, "He is dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, "This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would not have any one know it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, "The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they came to Caper'na-um; and when he was in the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, "If any one would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took a child, and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John said to him, "Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he was not following us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said, "Do not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For he that is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ, will by no means lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For every one will be salted with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its saltness, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
