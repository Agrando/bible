So they are no longer two but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when Jesus saw it he was indignant, and said to them, "Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know the commandments: `Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to him, "Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him, "You lack one thing; go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>At that saying his countenance fell, and he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it will be for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, "Then who can be saved?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus looked at them and said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter began to say to him, "Lo, we have left everything and followed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many that are first will be last, and the last first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>saying, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and kill him; and after three days he will rise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And James and John, the sons of Zeb'edee, came forward to him, and said to him, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they said to him, "Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said to him, "We are able." And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus called them to him and said to them, "You know that those who are supposed to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they came to Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimae'us, a blind beggar, the son of Timae'us, was sitting by the roadside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." And they called the blind man, saying to him, "Take heart; rise, he is calling you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And throwing off his mantle he sprang up and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?" And the blind man said to him, "Master, let me receive my sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to him, "Go your way; your faith has made you well." And immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
