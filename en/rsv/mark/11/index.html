Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming! Hosanna in the highest!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple; and when he had looked round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he taught, and said to them, "Is it not written, `My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when evening came they went out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter remembered and said to him, "Master, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, `Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against any one; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and they said to him, "By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to them, "I will ask you a question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they argued with one another, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will say, `Why then did you not believe him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But shall we say, `From men'?"--they were afraid of the people, for all held that John was a real prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
