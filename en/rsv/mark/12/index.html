"A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and dug a pit for the wine press, and built a tower, and let it out to tenants, and went into another country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He had still one other, a beloved son; finally he sent him to them, saying, `They will respect my son.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But those tenants said to one another, `This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have you not read this scripture: `The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they tried to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them; so they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Hero'di-ans, to entrap him in his talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they came and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are true, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Should we pay them, or should we not?" But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why put me to the test? Bring me a coin, and let me look at it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they brought one. And he said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They said to him, "Caesar's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were amazed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Sad'ducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the second took her, and died, leaving no children; and the third likewise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the seven left no children. Last of all the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus said to them, "Is not this why you are wrong, that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, `I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not God of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the first of all?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered, "The first is, `Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The second is this, `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the scribe said to him, "You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that he is one, and there is no other but he;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And after that no one dared to ask him any question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, "How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>David himself, inspired by the Holy Spirit, declared, `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put thy enemies under thy feet.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David himself calls him Lord; so how is he his son?" And the great throng heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And in his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to go about in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, "Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, her whole living."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
