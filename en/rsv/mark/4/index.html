And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Listen! A sower went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, "To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again, and be forgiven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower sows the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but the cares of the world, and the delight in riches, and the desire for other things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on a stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, "Take heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The earth produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care if we perish?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
