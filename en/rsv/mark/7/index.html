And many such things you do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he called the people to him again, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when he had entered the house, and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, "Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>since it enters, not his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?" (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, "What comes out of a man is what defiles a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultery,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and would not have any one know it; yet he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But immediately a woman, whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell down at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoeni'cian by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to her, "Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she answered him, "Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to her, "For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And she went home, and found the child lying in bed, and the demon gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decap'olis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Eph'phatha," that is, "Be opened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well; he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
