What is the wisdom given to him? What mighty works are wrought by his hands!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick people and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he marveled because of their unbelief.  And he went about among the villages teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, "Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they went out and preached that men should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>King Herod heard of it; for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, "John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But others said, "It is Eli'jah." And others said, "It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard of it he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Hero'di-as, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hero'di-as had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For when Hero'di-as' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he vowed to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the baptizer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king was exceedingly sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while." For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As he went ashore he saw a great throng, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>send them away, to go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he answered them, "You give them something to eat." And they said to him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, "How many loaves have you? Go and see." And when they had found out, they said, "Five, and two fish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he commanded them all to sit down by companies upon the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they all ate and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Beth-sa'ida, while he dismissed the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>for they all saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take heart, it is I; have no fear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennes'aret, and moored to the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and ran about the whole neighborhood and began to bring sick people on their pallets to any place where they heard he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or country, they laid the sick in the market places, and besought him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
