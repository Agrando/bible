Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately he left the synagogue, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her; and she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the whole city was gathered together about the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and those who were with him pursued him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they found him and said to him, "Every one is searching for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, "Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And a leper came to him beseeching him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, "I will; be clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he sternly charged him, and sent him away at once,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and said to him, "See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in the country; and people came to him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
