And he answered him, "You have said so."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused him of many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barab'bas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he answered them, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barab'bas instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cried out again, "Crucify him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barab'bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyre'ne, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they brought him to the place called Gol'gotha (which means the place of a skull).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>save yourself, and come down from the cross!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the scribes, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "E'lo-i, E'lo-i, la'ma sabach-tha'ni?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling Eli'jah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Eli'jah will come to take him down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salo'me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Joseph of Arimathe'a, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Mary Mag'dalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
