He has risen, he is not here; see the place where they laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went out and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it.
