So they are without excuse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man or birds or animals or reptiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a base mind and to improper conduct.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity, they are gossips,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Though they know God's decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do them but approve those who practice them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
