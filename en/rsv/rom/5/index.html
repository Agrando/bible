For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift in the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man's act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man's obedience many will be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Law came in, to increase the trespass; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
