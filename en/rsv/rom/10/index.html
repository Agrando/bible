(that is, to bring Christ down)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>or "Who will descend into the abyss?" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what does it say? The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart (that is, the word of faith which we preach);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>because, if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his lips and so is saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The scripture says, "No one who believes in him will be put to shame."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, "every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they have not all obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for  "Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says,  "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But of Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
