"Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now to one who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not reckon his sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is this blessing pronounced only upon the circumcised, or also upon the uncircumcised? We say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it reckoned to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He received circumcision as a sign or seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and likewise the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but also follow the example of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The promise to Abraham and his descendants, that they should inherit the world, did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants-- not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, for he is the father of us all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations" --in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations; as he had been told, "So shall your descendants be."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That is why his faith was "reckoned to him as righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the words, "it was reckoned to him," were written not for his sake alone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him that raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
