By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Eli'jah, how he pleads with God against Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have demolished thy altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what is God's reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Ba'al."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>as it is written,  "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear, down to this very day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David says,  "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a retribution for them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs for ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in order to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If the dough offered as first fruits is holy, so is the whole lump; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive tree,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And even the others, if they do not persist in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brethren: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles come in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and so all Israel will be saved; as it is written,  "The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory for ever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
