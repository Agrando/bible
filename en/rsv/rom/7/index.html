But if her husband dies she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now we are discharged from the law, dead to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet, if it had not been for the law, I should not have known sin. I should not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, wrought in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law sin lies dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the very commandment which promised life proved to be death to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then it is no longer I that do it, but sin which dwells within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin which dwells within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God, in my inmost self,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
