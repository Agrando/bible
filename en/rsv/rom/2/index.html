Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he will render to every man according to his works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For God shows no partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely upon the law and boast of your relation to God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed in the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>you then who teach others, will you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, spiritual and not literal. His praise is not from men but from God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
