Since you saw no form on the day that the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>beware lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves, in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And beware lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and worship them and serve them, things which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people of his own possession, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Furthermore the LORD was angry with me on your account, and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan, and that I should not enter the good land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over and take possession of that good land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make a graven image in the form of anything which the LORD your God has forbidden you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the LORD your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"When you beget children and children's children, and have grown old in the land, if you act corruptly by making a graven image in the form of anything, and by doing what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, so as to provoke him to anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you will soon utterly perish from the land which you are going over the Jordan to possess; you will not live long upon it, but will be utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD will drive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of men's hands, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, you will return to the LORD your God and obey his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for the LORD your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers which he swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>To you it was shown, that you might know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you; and on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And because he loved your fathers and chose their descendants after them, and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which the LORD your God gives you for ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Moses set apart three cities in the east beyond the Jordan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without being at enmity with him in time past, and that by fleeing to one of these cities he might save his life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manas'sites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>these are the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-pe'or, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel defeated when they came out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And they took possession of his land and the land of Og the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who lived to the east beyond the Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>from Aro'er, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, as far as Mount Si'rion (that is, Hermon),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
