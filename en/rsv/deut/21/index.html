but let the guilt of blood be forgiven them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"When you go forth to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God gives them into your hands, and you take them captive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have desire for her and would take her for yourself as wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and pare her nails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And she shall put off her captive's garb, and shall remain in your house and bewail her father and her mother a full month; after that you may go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then, if you have no delight in her, you shall let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her for money, you shall not treat her as a slave, since you have humiliated her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"If a man has two wives, the one loved and the other disliked, and they have borne him children, both the loved and the disliked, and if the first-born son is hers that is disliked,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then on the day when he assigns his possessions as an inheritance to his sons, he may not treat the son of the loved as the first-born in preference to the son of the disliked, who is the first-born,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the disliked, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the first issue of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they chastise him, will not give heed to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and they shall say to the elders of his city, `This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones; so you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"And if a man has committed a crime punishable by death and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall bury him the same day, for a hanged man is accursed by God; you shall not defile your land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
