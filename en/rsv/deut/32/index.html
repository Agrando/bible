Ascribe greatness to our God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"The Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They have dealt corruptly with him, they are no longer his children because of their blemish; they are a perverse and crooked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do you thus requite the LORD, you foolish and senseless people? Is not he your father, who created you, who made you and established you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations; ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of men, he fixed the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the LORD's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"He found him in a desert land, and in the howling waste of the wilderness; he encircled him, he cared for him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, that flutters over its young, spreading out its wings, catching them, bearing them on its pinions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no foreign god with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He made him ride on the high places of the earth, and he ate the produce of the field; and he made him suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Curds from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs and rams, herds of Bashan and goats, with the finest of the wheat--and of the blood of the grape you drank wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"But Jesh'urun waxed fat, and kicked; you waxed fat, you grew thick, you became sleek; then he forsook God who made him, and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods; with abominable practices they provoked him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They sacrificed to demons which were no gods, to gods they had never known, to new gods that had come in of late, whom your fathers had never dreaded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You were unmindful of the Rock that begot you, and you forgot the God who gave you birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"The LORD saw it, and spurned them, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, `I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be, for they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have stirred me to jealousy with what is no god; they have provoked me with their idols. So I will stir them to jealousy with those who are no people; I will provoke them with a foolish nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a fire is kindled by my anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol, devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"`And I will heap evils upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>they shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and poisonous pestilence; and I will send the teeth of beasts against them, with venom of crawling things of the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the open the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers shall be terror, destroying both young man and virgin, the sucking child with the man of gray hairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I would have said, "I will scatter them afar, I will make the remembrance of them cease from among men,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>had I not feared provocation by the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge amiss, lest they should say, "Our hand is triumphant, the LORD has not wrought all this."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"For they are a nation void of counsel, and there is no understanding in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If they were wise, they would understand this, they would discern their latter end!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had given them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom, and from the fields of Gomor'rah; their grapes are grapes of poison, their clusters are bitter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>their wine is the poison of serpents, and the cruel venom of asps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up in my treasuries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Vengeance is mine, and recompense, for the time when their foot shall slip; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and their doom comes swiftly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none remaining, bond or free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he will say, `Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, let them be your protection!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"`See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For I lift up my hand to heaven, and swear, As I live for ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>if I whet my glittering sword, and my hand takes hold on judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries, and will requite those who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh--with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the long-haired heads of the enemy.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"Praise his people, O you nations; for he avenges the blood of his servants, and takes vengeance on his adversaries, and makes expiation for the land of his people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>he said to them, "Lay to heart all the words which I enjoin upon you this day, that you may command them to your children, that they may be careful to do all the words of this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For it is no trifle for you, but it is your life, and thereby you shall live long in the land which you are going over the Jordan to possess."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the LORD said to Moses that very day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"Ascend this mountain of the Ab'arim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho; and view the land of Canaan, which I give to the people of Israel for a possession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered to his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>because you broke faith with me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Mer'i-bath-ka'desh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you did not revere me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there, into the land which I give to the people of Israel."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
