even to the tenth generation none of his descendants shall enter the assembly of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"No Ammonite or Moabite shall enter the assembly of the LORD; even to the tenth generation none belonging to them shall enter the assembly of the LORD for ever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because they did not meet you with bread and with water on the way, when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Be'or from Pethor of Mesopota'mia, to curse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Nevertheless the LORD your God would not hearken to Balaam; but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall not seek their peace or their prosperity all your days for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"You shall not abhor an E'domite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a sojourner in his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The children of the third generation that are born to them may enter the assembly of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"When you go forth against your enemies and are in camp, then you shall keep yourself from every evil thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"If there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of what chances to him by night, then he shall go outside the camp, he shall not come within the camp;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but when evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water, and when the sun is down, he may come within the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"You shall have a place outside the camp and you shall go out to it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and you shall have a stick with your weapons; and when you sit down outside, you shall dig a hole with it, and turn back and cover up your excrement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp, to save you and to give up your enemies before you, therefore your camp must be holy, that he may not see anything indecent among you, and turn away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>he shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place which he shall choose within one of your towns, where it pleases him best; you shall not oppress him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"There shall be no cult prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a cult prostitute of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God in payment for any vow; for both of these are an abomination to the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"You shall not lend upon interest to your brother, interest on money, interest on victuals, interest on anything that is lent for interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To a foreigner you may lend upon interest, but to your brother you shall not lend upon interest; that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land which you are entering to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"When you make a vow to the LORD your God, you shall not be slack to pay it; for the LORD your God will surely require it of you, and it would be sin in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if you refrain from vowing, it shall be no sin in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You shall be careful to perform what has passed your lips, for you have voluntarily vowed to the LORD your God what you have promised with your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"When you go into your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes, as many as you wish, but you shall not put any in your vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When you go into your neighbor's standing grain, you may pluck the ears with your hand, but you shall not put a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
