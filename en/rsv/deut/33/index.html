With thy hands contend for him, and be a help against his adversaries."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And of Levi he said, "Give to Levi thy Thummim, and thy Urim to thy godly one, whom thou didst test at Massah, with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Mer'ibah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who said of his father and mother, `I regard them not'; he disowned his brothers, and ignored his children. For they observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall teach Jacob thy ordinances, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt offering upon thy altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Bless, O LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; crush the loins of his adversaries, of those that hate him, that they rise not again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Of Benjamin he said, "The beloved of the LORD, he dwells in safety by him; he encompasses him all the day long, and makes his dwelling between his shoulders."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And of Joseph he said, "Blessed by the LORD be his land, with the choicest gifts of heaven above, and of the deep that couches beneath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>with the choicest fruits of the sun, and the rich yield of the months,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>with the finest produce of the ancient mountains, and the abundance of the everlasting hills,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>with the best gifts of the earth and its fulness, and the favor of him that dwelt in the bush. Let these come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His firstling bull has majesty, and his horns are the horns of a wild ox; with them he shall push the peoples, all of them, to the ends of the earth; such are the ten thousands of E'phraim, and such are the thousands of Manas'seh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And of Zeb'ulun he said, "Rejoice, Zeb'ulun, in your going out; and Is'sachar, in your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall call peoples to their mountain; there they offer right sacrifices; for they suck the affluence of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And of Gad he said, "Blessed be he who enlarges Gad! Gad couches like a lion, he tears the arm, and the crown of the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He chose the best of the land for himself, for there a commander's portion was reserved; and he came to the heads of the people, with Israel he executed the commands and just decrees of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's whelp, that leaps forth from Bashan."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of Naph'tali he said, "O Naph'tali, satisfied with favor, and full of the blessing of the LORD, possess the lake and the south."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And of Asher he said, "Blessed above sons be Asher; let him be the favorite of his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your bars shall be iron and bronze; and as your days, so shall your strength be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"There is none like God, O Jesh'urun, who rides through the heavens to your help, and in his majesty through the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy before you, and said, Destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Israel dwelt in safety, the fountain of Jacob alone, in a land of grain and wine; yea, his heavens drop down dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and the sword of your triumph! Your enemies shall come fawning to you; and you shall tread upon their high places."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
