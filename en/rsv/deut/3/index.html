Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aro'er, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manas'seh. (The whole of that Bashan is called the land of Reph'aim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ja'ir the Manas'site took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Gesh'urites and the Ma-ac'athites, and called the villages after his own name, Hav'voth-ja'ir, as it is to this day.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To Machir I gave Gilead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a boundary, as far over as the river Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the boundary, from Chin'nereth as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And I commanded you at that time, saying, `The LORD your God has given you this land to possess; all your men of valor shall pass over armed before your brethren the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But your wives, your little ones, and your cattle (I know that you have many cattle) shall remain in the cities which I have given you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>until the LORD gives rest to your brethren, as to you, and they also occupy the land which the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan; then you shall return every man to his possession which I have given you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I commanded Joshua at that time, `Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are going over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall not fear them; for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`O Lord GOD, thou hast only begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as thine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let me go over, I pray, and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that goodly hill country, and Lebanon.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the LORD was angry with me on your account, and would not hearken to me; and the LORD said to me, `Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and behold it with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him; for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land which you shall see.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-pe'or.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
