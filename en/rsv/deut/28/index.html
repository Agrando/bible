you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell in it; you shall plant a vineyard, and you shall not use the fruit of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat of it; your ass shall be violently taken away before your face, and shall not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and there shall be no one to help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, while your eyes look on and fail with longing for them all the day; and it shall not be in the power of your hand to prevent it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>A nation which you have not known shall eat up the fruit of your ground and of all your labors; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>so that you shall be driven mad by the sight which your eyes shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The LORD will smite you on the knees and on the legs with grievous boils of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"The LORD will bring you, and your king whom you set over you, to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known;

for the locust shall consume it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All your trees and the fruit of your ground the locust shall possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The sojourner who is among you shall mount above you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>All these curses shall come upon you and pursue you and overtake you, till you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They shall be upon you as a sign and a wonder, and upon your descendants for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joyfulness and gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against you, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness, and in want of all things; and he will put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he has destroyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The LORD will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you do not understand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>a nation of stern countenance, who shall not regard the person of the old or show favor to the young,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and shall eat the offspring of your cattle and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed; who also shall not leave you grain, wine, or oil, the increase of your cattle or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They shall besiege you in all your towns, until your high and fortified walls, in which you trusted, come down throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all your towns throughout all your land, which the LORD your God has given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And you shall eat the offspring of your own body, the flesh of your sons and daughters, whom the LORD your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The man who is the most tender and delicately bred among you will grudge food to his brother, to the wife of his bosom, and to the last of the children who remain to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>so that he will not give to any of them any of the flesh of his children whom he is eating, because he has nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The most tender and delicately bred woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot upon the ground because she is so delicate and tender, will grudge to the husband of her bosom, to her son and to her daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>her afterbirth that comes out from between her feet and her children whom she bears, because she will eat them secretly, for want of all things, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>"If you are not careful to do all the words of this law which are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awful name, the LORD your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>then the LORD will bring on you and your offspring extraordinary afflictions, afflictions severe and lasting, and sicknesses grievous and lasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he will bring upon you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Every sickness also, and every affliction which is not recorded in the book of this law, the LORD will bring upon you, until you are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Whereas you were as the stars of heaven for multitude, you shall be left few in number; because you did not obey the voice of the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And as the LORD took delight in doing you good and multiplying you, so the LORD will take delight in bringing ruin upon you and destroying you; and you shall be plucked off the land which you are entering to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And the LORD will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among these nations you shall find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot; but the LORD will give you there a trembling heart, and failing eyes, and a languishing soul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>your life shall hang in doubt before you; night and day you shall be in dread, and have no assurance of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning you shall say, `Would it were evening!' and at evening you shall say, `Would it were morning!' because of the dread which your heart shall fear, and the sights which your eyes shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And the LORD will bring you back in ships to Egypt, a journey which I promised that you should never make again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no man will buy you."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
