And to your bondwoman you shall do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for at half the cost of a hired servant he has served you six years. So the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"All the firstling males that are born of your herd and flock you shall consecrate to the LORD your God; you shall do no work with the firstling of your herd, nor shear the firstling of your flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall eat it, you and your household, before the LORD your God year by year at the place which the LORD will choose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if it has any blemish, if it is lame or blind, or has any serious blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall eat it within your towns; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it, as though it were a gazelle or a hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
