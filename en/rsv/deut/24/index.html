for that is an abomination before the LORD, and you shall not bring guilt upon the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"When a man is newly married, he shall not go out with the army or be charged with any business; he shall be free at home one year, to be happy with his wife whom he has taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"No man shall take a mill or an upper millstone in pledge; for he would be taking a life in pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"If a man is found stealing one of his brethren, the people of Israel, and if he treats him as a slave or sells him, then that thief shall die; so you shall purge the evil from the midst of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Take heed, in an attack of leprosy, to be very careful to do according to all that the Levitical priests shall direct you; as I commanded them, so you shall be careful to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the way as you came forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"When you make your neighbor a loan of any sort, you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you make the loan shall bring the pledge out to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if he is a poor man, you shall not sleep in his pledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>when the sun goes down, you shall restore to him the pledge that he may sleep in his cloak and bless you; and it shall be righteousness to you before the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your brethren or one of the sojourners who are in your land within your towns;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>you shall give him his hire on the day he earns it, before the sun goes down (for he is poor, and sets his heart upon it); lest he cry against you to the LORD, and it be sin in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"You shall not pervert the justice due to the sojourner or to the fatherless, or take a widow's garment in pledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you from there; therefore I command you to do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow; that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I command you to do this.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
