and that your days may be prolonged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them; that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And when the LORD your God brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, with great and goodly cities, which you did not build,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and houses full of all good things, which you did not fill, and cisterns hewn out, which you did not hew, and vineyards and olive trees, which you did not plant, and when you eat and are full,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then take heed lest you forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall fear the LORD your God;

lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that it may go well with you, and that you may go in and take possession of the good land which the LORD swore to give to your fathers</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>by thrusting out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"When your son asks you in time to come, `What is the meaning of the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD our God has commanded you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then you shall say to your son, `We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt;
