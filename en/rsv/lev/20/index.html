the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I myself will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech, defiling my sanctuary and profaning my holy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if the people of the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then I will set my face against that man and against his family, and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in playing the harlot after Molech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"If a person turns to mediums and wizards, playing the harlot after them, I will set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Keep my statutes, and do them; I am the LORD who sanctify you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For every one who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his blood is upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death; they have committed incest, their blood is upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man takes a wife and her mother also, it is wickedness; they shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there may be no wickedness among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"If a man takes his sister, a daughter of his father or a daughter of his mother, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful thing, and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people; he has uncovered his sister's nakedness, he shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, and uncovers her nakedness, he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood; both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister or of your father's sister, for that is to make naked one's near kin; they shall bear their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If a man lies with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness; they shall bear their sin, they shall die childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If a man takes his brother's wife, it is impurity; he has uncovered his brother's nakedness, they shall be childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"You shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and do them; that the land where I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I have said to you, `You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey.' I am the LORD your God, who have separated you from the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; you shall not make yourselves abominable by beast or by bird or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You shall be holy to me; for I the LORD am holy, and have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"A man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall be put to death; they shall be stoned with stones, their blood shall be upon them."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
