He shall be brought to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall make an examination. Then, if the leprous disease is healed in the leper,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds and cedarwood and scarlet stuff and hyssop;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He shall take the living bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet stuff and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he shall sprinkle it seven times upon him who is to be cleansed of leprosy; then he shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird go into the open field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean; and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head; he shall shave off his beard and his eyebrows, all his hair. Then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a cereal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and one log of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before the LORD, at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer it for a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place; for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and sprinkle some oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the guilt offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill the burnt offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the cereal offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"But if he is poor and cannot afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a guilt offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a cereal offering, and a log of oil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>also two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he can afford; the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting, before the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and the great toe of his right foot, in the place where the blood of the guilt offering was put;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he shall offer, of the turtledoves or young pigeons such as he can afford,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, along with a cereal offering; and the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for him who is being cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is the law for him in whom is a leprous disease, who cannot afford the offerings for his cleansing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, `There seems to me to be some sort of disease in my house.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be declared unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he shall examine the disease; and if the disease is in the walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to be deeper than the surface,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look; and if the disease has spread in the walls of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped round about, and the plaster that they scrape off they shall pour into an unclean place outside the city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other plaster and plaster the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>then the priest shall go and look; and if the disease has spread in the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house; it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all the plaster of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city to an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Moreover he who enters the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"But if the priest comes and makes an examination, and the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the disease is healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And for the cleansing of the house he shall take two small birds, with cedarwood and scarlet stuff and hyssop,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and shall take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the scarlet stuff, along with the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet stuff;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field; so he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is the law for any leprous disease: for an itch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>for leprosy in a garment or in a house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and for a swelling or an eruption or a spot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>to show when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law for leprosy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
