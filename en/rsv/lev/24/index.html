And they brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelo'mith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they put him in custody, till the will of the LORD should be declared to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And say to the people of Israel, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him; the sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who kills a man shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who kills a beast shall make it good, life for life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When a man causes a disfigurement in his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has disfigured a man, he shall be disfigured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who kills a beast shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall have one law for the sojourner and for the native; for I am the LORD your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Moses spoke to the people of Israel; and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones.
