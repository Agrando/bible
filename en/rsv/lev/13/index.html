and if the hair in the diseased spot has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous disease; when the priest has examined him he shall pronounce him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But if the spot is white in the skin of his body, and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall shut up the diseased person for seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the diseased spot is dim and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the eruption spreads in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the priest shall make an examination, and if the eruption has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"When a man is afflicted with leprosy, he shall be brought to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the priest shall make an examination, and if there is a white swelling in the skin, which has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if the leprosy breaks out in the skin, so that the leprosy covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>then the priest shall make an examination, and if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it has all turned white, and he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean; raw flesh is unclean, for it is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean; he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And when there is in the skin of one's body a boil that has healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, then it shall be shown to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the priest shall make an examination, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the disease of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the priest examines it, and the hair on it is not white and it is not deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and if it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is diseased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Or, when the body has a burn on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, reddish-white or white,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, then it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the priest examines it, and the hair in the spot is not white and it is no deeper than the skin, but is dim, the priest shall shut him up seven days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the priest shall examine him the seventh day; if it is spreading in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin, but is dim, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"When a man or woman has a disease on the head or the beard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the priest shall examine the disease; and if it appears deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an itch, a leprosy of the head or the beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if the priest examines the itching disease, and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the disease; and if the itch has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>then he shall shave himself, but the itch he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch, and if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then the priest shall examine him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if in his eyes the itch is checked, and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>the priest shall make an examination, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is tetter that has broken out in the skin; he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"If a man's hair has fallen from his head, he is bald but he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if a man's hair has fallen from his forehead and temples, he has baldness of the forehead but he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased spot, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest must pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"The leper who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry, `Unclean, unclean.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease; he is unclean; he shall dwell alone in a habitation outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"When there is a leprous disease in a garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>if the disease shows greenish or reddish in the garment, whether in warp or woof or in skin or in anything made of skin, it is a leprous disease and shall be shown to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the priest shall examine the disease, and shut up that which has the disease for seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>then he shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the garment, in warp or woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, the disease is a malignant leprosy; it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall burn the garment, whether diseased in warp or woof, woolen or linen, or anything of skin, for it is a malignant leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>"And if the priest examines, and the disease has not spread in the garment in warp or woof or in anything of skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the disease, and he shall shut it up seven days more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed. And if the diseased spot has not changed color, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether the leprous spot is on the back or on the front.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>"But if the priest examines, and the disease is dim after it is washed, he shall tear the spot out of the garment or the skin or the warp or woof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>then if it appears again in the garment, in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading; you shall burn with fire that in which is the disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But the garment, warp or woof, or anything of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and be clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This is the law for a leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, to decide whether it is clean or unclean.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
