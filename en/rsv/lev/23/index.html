but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no work; it is a sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at the time appointed for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, is the LORD's passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to the LORD; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD seven days; on the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Say to the people of Israel, When you come into the land which I give you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, that you may find acceptance; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the cereal offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, to be offered by fire to the LORD, a pleasing odor; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall eat neither bread nor grain parched or fresh until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"And you shall count from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven full weeks shall they be,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>counting fifty days to the morrow after the seventh sabbath; then you shall present a cereal offering of new grain to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall bring from your dwellings two loaves of bread to be waved, made of two tenths of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, as first fruits to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, and one young bull, and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their cereal offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you shall make proclamation on the same day; you shall hold a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field to its very border, nor shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Say to the people of Israel, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of solemn rest, a memorial proclaimed with blast of trumpets, a holy convocation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You shall do no laborious work; and you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"On the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be for you a time of holy convocation, and you shall afflict yourselves and present an offering by fire to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you shall do no work on this same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whoever is not afflicted on this same day shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And whoever does any work on this same day, that person I will destroy from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You shall do no work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It shall be to you a sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict yourselves; on the ninth day of the month beginning at evening, from evening to evening shall you keep your sabbath."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Say to the people of Israel, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month and for seven days is the feast of booths to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Seven days you shall present offerings by fire to the LORD; on the eighth day you shall hold a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD; it is a solemn assembly; you shall do no laborious work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim as times of holy convocation, for presenting to the LORD offerings by fire, burnt offerings and cereal offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>besides the sabbaths of the LORD, and besides your gifts, and besides all your votive offerings, and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall keep the feast of the LORD seven days; on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And you shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You shall keep it as a feast to the LORD seven days in the year; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>You shall dwell in booths for seven days; all that are native in Israel shall dwell in booths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thus Moses declared to the people of Israel the appointed feasts of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
