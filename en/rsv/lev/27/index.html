according to the ability of him who vowed the priest shall value him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"If it is an animal such as men offer as an offering to the LORD, all of such that any man gives to the LORD is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall not substitute anything for it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he makes any exchange of beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if it is an unclean animal such as is not offered as an offering to the LORD, then the man shall bring the animal before the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a fifth to the valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"When a man dedicates his house to be holy to the LORD, the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if he who dedicates it wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a fifth of the valuation in money to it, and it shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"If a man dedicates to the LORD part of the land which is his by inheritance, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it; a sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, it shall stand at your full valuation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall compute the money-value for it according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of the valuation in money to it, and it shall remain his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but the field, when it is released in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field that has been devoted; the priest shall be in possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If he dedicates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not a part of his possession by inheritance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then the priest shall compute the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give the amount of the valuation on that day as a holy thing to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to whom the land belongs as a possession by inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Every valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"But a firstling of animals, which as a firstling belongs to the LORD, no man may dedicate; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back at your valuation, and add a fifth to it; or, if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at your valuation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"But no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD, of anything that he has, whether of man or beast, or of his inherited field, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>No one devoted, who is to be utterly destroyed from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If a man wishes to redeem any of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And all the tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>A man shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange it; and if he exchanges it, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
