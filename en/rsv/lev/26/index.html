And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will set my face against you, and you shall be smitten before your enemies; those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee when none pursues you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if in spite of this you will not hearken to me, then I will chastise you again sevenfold for your sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like brass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its increase, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Then if you walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring more plagues upon you, sevenfold as many as your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will let loose the wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, so that your ways shall become desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"And if by this discipline you are not turned to me, but walk contrary to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then I also will walk contrary to you, and I myself will smite you sevenfold for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute vengeance for the covenant; and if you gather within your cities I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and shall deliver your bread again by weight; and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"And if in spite of this you will not hearken to me, but walk contrary to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then I will walk contrary to you in fury, and chastise you myself sevenfold for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the dead bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will lay your cities waste, and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your pleasing odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will devastate the land, so that your enemies who settle in it shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate, while you are in your enemies' land; then the land shall rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, the rest which it had not in your sabbaths when you dwelt upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as for those of you that are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues; and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those of you that are left shall pine away in your enemies' lands because of their iniquity; and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away like them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their treachery which they committed against me, and also in walking contrary to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>so that I walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the land shall be left by them, and enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; and they shall make amends for their iniquity, because they spurned my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, neither will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>but I will for their sake remember the covenant with their forefathers, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the LORD made between him and the people of Israel on Mount Sinai by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
