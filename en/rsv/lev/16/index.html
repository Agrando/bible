He shall bathe his body in water, and then put them on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"And Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he shall take the two goats, and set them before the LORD at the door of the tent of meeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for Aza'zel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the LORD, and offer it as a sin offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but the goat on which the lot fell for Aza'zel shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Aza'zel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house; he shall kill the bull as a sin offering for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small;

their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"And it shall be a statute to you for ever that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict yourselves, and shall do no work, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; it is a statute for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the priest who is anointed and consecrated as priest in his father's place shall make atonement, wearing the holy linen garments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he shall make atonement for the sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this shall be an everlasting statute for you, that atonement may be made for the people of Israel once in the year because of all their sins." And Moses did as the LORD commanded him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
