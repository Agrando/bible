But the word of God is not fettered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The saying is sure:  If we have died with him, we shall also live with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>if we endure, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>if we are faithless, he remains faithful-- for he cannot deny himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remind them of this, and charge them before the Lord to avoid disputing about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Avoid such godless chatter, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and their talk will eat its way like gangrene. Among them are Hymenae'us and Phile'tus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who have swerved from the truth by holding that the resurrection is past already. They are upsetting the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for noble use, some for ignoble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If any one purifies himself from what is ignoble, then he will be a vessel for noble use, consecrated and useful to the master of the house, ready for any good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So shun youthful passions and aim at righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Have nothing to do with stupid, senseless controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to every one, an apt teacher, forbearing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and they may escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
