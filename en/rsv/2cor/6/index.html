Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We put no obstacle in any one's way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>beatings, imprisonments, tumults, labors, watching, hunger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>by purity, knowledge, forbearance, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as punished, and yet not killed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In return--I speak as to children--widen your hearts also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do not be mismated with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What accord has Christ with Be'lial? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, "I will live in them and move among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore come out from them, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
