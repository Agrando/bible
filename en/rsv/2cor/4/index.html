Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
