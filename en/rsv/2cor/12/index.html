But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities; for when I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was not at all inferior to these superlative apostles, even though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The signs of a true apostle were performed among you in all patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Here for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for I seek not what is yours but you; for children ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you the more, am I to be loved the less?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But granting that I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear that perhaps I may come and find you not what I wish, and that you may find me not what you wish; that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and licentiousness which they have practiced.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
