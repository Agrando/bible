With all our affliction, I am overjoyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even when we came into Macedo'nia, our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted at every turn--fighting without and fear within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it (though I did regret it), for I see that that letter grieved you, though only for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting; for you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but worldly grief produces death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore we are comforted.  And besides our own comfort we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his mind has been set at rest by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I have expressed to him some pride in you, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting before Titus has proved true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his heart goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, and the fear and trembling with which you received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice, because I have perfect confidence in you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
