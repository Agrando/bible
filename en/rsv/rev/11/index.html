And in the sight of their foes they went up to heaven in a cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying,  "We give thanks to thee, Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast, that thou hast taken thy great power and begun to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The nations raged, but thy wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, for rewarding thy servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear thy name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
