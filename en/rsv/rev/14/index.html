No one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are chaste; it is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes; these have been redeemed from mankind as first fruits for God and the Lamb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are spotless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he said with a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come; and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Another angel, a second, followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of her impure passion."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If any one worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he also shall drink the wine of God's wrath, poured unmixed into the cup of his anger, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth." "Blessed indeed," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I looked, and lo, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat upon the cloud, "Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So he who sat upon the cloud swung his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Put in your sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as a horse's bridle, for one thousand six hundred stadia.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
