And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>she brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which to be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world--he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rejoice then, O heaven and you that dwell therein! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had borne the male child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon had poured from his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus. And he stood on the sand of the sea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
