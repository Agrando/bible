If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet this you have, you hate the works of the Nicola'itans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: `The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"`I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who conquers shall not be hurt by the second death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"And to the angel of the church in Per'gamum write: `The words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"`I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; you hold fast my name and you did not deny my faith even in the days of An'tipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So you also have some who hold the teaching of the Nicola'itans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent then. If not, I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one knows except him who receives it.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And to the angel of the church in Thyati'ra write: `The words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"`I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jez'ebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I will throw her on a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her doings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you as your works deserve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to the rest of you in Thyati'ra, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay upon you any other burden;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>only hold fast what you have, until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, I will give him power over the nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received power from my Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I will give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
