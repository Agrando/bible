He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he who sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." Also he said, "Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, "It is done!
