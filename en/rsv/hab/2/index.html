If it seem slow, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, he whose soul is not upright in him shall fail, but the righteous shall live by his faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover, wine is treacherous; the arrogant man shall not abide. His greed is as wide as Sheol; like death he has never enough. He gathers for himself all nations, and collects as his own all peoples."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Shall not all these take up their taunt against him, in scoffing derision of him, and say, "Woe to him who heaps up what is not his own--for how long?--and loads himself with pledges!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will not your debtors suddenly arise, and those awake who will make you tremble? Then you will be booty for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you, for the blood of men and violence to the earth, to cities and all who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to be safe from the reach of harm!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have devised shame to your house by cutting off many peoples; you have forfeited your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam from the woodwork respond.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and founds a city on iniquity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, is it not from the LORD of hosts that peoples labor only for fire, and nations weary themselves for nought?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink of the cup of his wrath, and makes them drunk, to gaze on their shame!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will be sated with contempt instead of glory. Drink, yourself, and stagger! The cup in the LORD's right hand will come around to you, and shame will come upon your glory!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you; the destruction of the beasts will terrify you, for the blood of men and violence to the earth, to cities and all who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What profit is an idol when its maker has shaped it, a metal image, a teacher of lies? For the workman trusts in his own creation when he makes dumb idols!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, Awake; to a dumb stone, Arise! Can this give revelation? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
