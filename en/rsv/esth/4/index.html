And I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they told Mor'decai what Esther had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Mor'decai told them to return answer to Esther, "Think not that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Esther told them to reply to Mor'decai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Mor'decai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
