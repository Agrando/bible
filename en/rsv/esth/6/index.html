The king's servants who attended him said, "Nothing has been done for him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace to speak to the king about having Mor'decai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the king's servants told him, "Haman is there, standing in the court." And the king said, "Let him come in."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Haman came in, and the king said to him, "What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?" And Haman said to himself, "Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king delights to honor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown is set;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble princes; let him array the man whom the king delights to honor, and let him conduct the man on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him: `Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king said to Haman, "Make haste, take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mor'decai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he arrayed Mor'decai and made him ride through the open square of the city, proclaiming, "Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Mor'decai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, "If Mor'decai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and brought Haman in haste to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
