But Mor'decai did not bow down or do obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mor'decai, "Why do you transgress the king's command?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mor'decai's words would avail; for he had told them that he was a Jew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Haman saw that Mor'decai did not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman was filled with fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he disdained to lay hands on Mor'decai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mor'decai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mor'decai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasu-e'rus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasu-e'rus, they cast Pur, that is the lot, before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Haman said to King Ahasu-e'rus, "There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not for the king's profit to tolerate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, that they may put it into the king's treasuries."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Ag'agite, the son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king said to Haman, "The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the king's secretaries were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the princes of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasu-e'rus and sealed with the king's ring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The couriers went in haste by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the capital. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
