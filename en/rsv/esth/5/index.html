The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the palace opposite the entrance to the palace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said to her, "What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esther said, "If it please the king, let the king and Haman come this day to a dinner that I have prepared for the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said the king, "Bring Haman quickly, that we may do as Esther desires." So the king and Haman came to the dinner that Esther had prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And as they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, "What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Esther said, "My petition and my request is:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and fulfil my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the dinner which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mor'decai in the king's gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mor'decai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and his wife Zeresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Haman added, "Even Queen Esther let no one come with the king to the banquet she prepared but myself. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet all this does me no good, so long as I see Mor'decai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mor'decai hanged upon it; then go merrily with the king to the dinner." This counsel pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
