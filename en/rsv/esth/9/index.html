And no one could make a stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and the royal officials also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mor'decai had fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Mor'decai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mor'decai grew more and more powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the Jews smote all their enemies with the sword, slaughtering, and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In Susa the capital itself the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and also slew Par-shan-da'tha and Dalphon and Aspa'tha</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Pora'tha and Ada'lia and Arida'tha</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and Parmash'ta and Ar'isai and Ar'idai and Vaiza'tha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of the Jews; but they laid no hand on the plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That very day the number of those slain in Susa the capital was reported to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king said to Queen Esther, "In Susa the capital the Jews have slain five hundred men and also the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what further is your request? It shall be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Esther said, "If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict. And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the king commanded this to be done; a decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they slew three hundred men in Susa; but they laid no hands on the plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the other Jews who were in the king's provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies, and slew seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they laid no hands on the plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the open towns, hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting and holiday-making, and a day on which they send choice portions to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Mor'decai recorded these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasu-e'rus, both near and far,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>enjoining them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending choice portions to one another and gifts to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mor'decai had written to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Haman the Ag'agite, the son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to crush and destroy them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but when Esther came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his wicked plot which he had devised against the Jews should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term Pur. And therefore, because of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter, and of what had befallen them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the Jews ordained and took it upon themselves and their descendants and all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at the time appointed every year,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, in every family, province, and city, and that these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Ab'ihail, and Mor'decai the Jew gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Letters were sent to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasu-e'rus, in words of peace and truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons, as Mor'decai the Jew and Queen Esther enjoined upon the Jews, and as they had laid down for themselves and for their descendants, with regard to their fasts and their lamenting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The command of Queen Esther fixed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
