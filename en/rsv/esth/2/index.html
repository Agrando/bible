This pleased the king, and he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now there was a Jew in Susa the capital whose name was Mor'decai, the son of Ja'ir, son of Shim'e-i, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconi'ah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnez'zar king of Babylon had carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He had brought up Hadas'sah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother; the maiden was beautiful and lovely, and when her father and her mother died, Mor'decai adopted her as his own daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when the king's order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many maidens were gathered in Susa the capital in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king's palace and put in custody of Hegai who had charge of the women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the maiden pleased him and won his favor; and he quickly provided her with her ointments and her portion of food, and with seven chosen maids from the king's palace, and advanced her and her maids to the best place in the harem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mor'decai had charged her not to make it known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every day Mor'decai walked in front of the court of the harem, to learn how Esther was and how she fared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when the turn came for each maiden to go in to King Ahasu-e'rus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>when the maiden went in to the king in this way she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the evening she went, and in the morning she came back to the second harem in custody of Sha-ash'gaz the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines; she did not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Ab'ihail the uncle of Mor'decai, who had adopted her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Esther was taken to King Ahasu-e'rus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king gave a great banquet to all his princes and servants; it was Esther's banquet. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces, and gave gifts with royal liberality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mor'decai was sitting at the king's gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mor'decai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Mor'decai just as when she was brought up by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in those days, as Mor'decai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasu-e'rus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And this came to the knowledge of Mor'decai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mor'decai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows. And it was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
