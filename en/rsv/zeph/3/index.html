She does not trust in the LORD, she does not draw near to her God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Her officials within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves that leave nothing till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Her prophets are wanton, faithless men; her priests profane what is sacred, they do violence to the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The LORD within her is righteous, he does no wrong; every morning he shows forth his justice, each dawn he does not fail; but the unjust knows no shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"I have cut off nations; their battlements are in ruins; I have laid waste their streets so that none walks in them; their cities have been made desolate, without a man, without an inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I said, `Surely she will fear me, she will accept correction; she will not lose sight of all that I have enjoined upon her.' But all the more they were eager to make all their deeds corrupt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Therefore wait for me," says the LORD, "for the day when I arise as a witness. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out upon them my indignation, all the heat of my anger; for in the fire of my jealous wrath all the earth shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Yea, at that time I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him with one accord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, the daughter of my dispersed ones, shall bring my offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"On that day you shall not be put to shame because of the deeds by which you have rebelled against me; for then I will remove from your midst your proudly exultant ones, and you shall no longer be haughty in my holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will leave in the midst of you a people humble and lowly. They shall seek refuge in the name of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>those who are left in Israel; they shall do no wrong and utter no lies, nor shall there be found in their mouth a deceitful tongue. For they shall pasture and lie down, and none shall make them afraid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The LORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has cast out your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear evil no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: "Do not fear, O Zion; let not your hands grow weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>as on a day of festival. "I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, at that time I will deal with all your oppressors. And I will save the lame and gather the outcast, and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you together; yea, I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes," says the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
