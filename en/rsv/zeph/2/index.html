The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; and I will destroy you till no inhabitant is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures, meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The seacoast shall become the possession of the remnant of the house of Judah, on which they shall pasture, and in the houses of Ash'kelon they shall lie down at evening. For the LORD their God will be mindful of them and restore their fortunes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"I have heard the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites, how they have taunted my people and made boasts against their territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, as I live," says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Moab shall become like Sodom, and the Ammonites like Gomor'rah, a land possessed by nettles and salt pits, and a waste for ever. The remnant of my people shall plunder them, and the survivors of my nation shall possess them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This shall be their lot in return for their pride, because they scoffed and boasted against the people of the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The LORD will be terrible against them; yea, he will famish all the gods of the earth, and to him shall bow down, each in its place, all the lands of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You also, O Ethiopians, shall be slain by my sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and he will make Nin'eveh a desolation, a dry waste like the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the field; the vulture and the hedgehog shall lodge in her capitals; the owl shall hoot in the window, the raven croak on the threshold; for her cedar work will be laid bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This is the exultant city that dwelt secure, that said to herself, "I am and there is none else."
