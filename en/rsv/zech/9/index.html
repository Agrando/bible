For to the LORD belong the cities of Aram, even as all the tribes of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Hamath also, which borders thereon, Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Tyre has built herself a rampart, and heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But lo, the Lord will strip her of her possessions and hurl her wealth into the sea, and she shall be devoured by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ash'kelon shall see it, and be afraid; Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; Ekron also, because its hopes are confounded. The king shall perish from Gaza; Ash'kelon shall be uninhabited;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>a mongrel people shall dwell in Ashdod; and I will make an end of the pride of Philistia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will take away its blood from its mouth, and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah, and Ekron shall be like the Jeb'usites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I will encamp at my house as a guard, so that none shall march to and fro; no oppressor shall again overrun them, for now I see with my own eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on an ass, on a colt the foal of an ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I will cut off the chariot from E'phraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall command peace to the nations; his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your captives free from the waterless pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have bent Judah as my bow; I have made E'phraim its arrow. I will brandish your sons, O Zion, over your sons, O Greece, and wield you like a warrior's sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the LORD will appear over them, and his arrow go forth like lightning; the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet, and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The LORD of hosts will protect them, and they shall devour and tread down the slingers; and they shall drink their blood like wine, and be full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>On that day the LORD their God will save them for they are the flock of his people; for like the jewels of a crown they shall shine on his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea, how good and how fair it shall be! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maidens.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
