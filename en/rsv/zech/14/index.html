Then the LORD your God will come, and all the holy ones with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On that day there shall be neither cold nor frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there shall be continuous day (it is known to the LORD), not day and not night, for at evening time there shall be light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea; it shall continue in summer as in winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD will become king over all the earth; on that day the LORD will be one and his name one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft upon its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Han'anel to the king's wine presses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall be inhabited, for there shall be no more curse; Jerusalem shall dwell in security.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh shall rot while they are still on their feet, their eyes shall rot in their sockets, and their tongues shall rot in their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And on that day a great panic from the LORD shall fall on them, so that each will lay hold on the hand of his fellow, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the nations round about shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the asses, and whatever beasts may be in those camps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then every one that survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of booths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the family of Egypt do not go up and present themselves, then upon them shall come the plague with which the LORD afflicts the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of booths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of booths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "Holy to the LORD." And the pots in the house of the LORD shall be as the bowls before the altar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be sacred to the LORD of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil the flesh of the sacrifice in them.
