For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and none shall make them afraid; for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the peoples walk each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day, says the LORD, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away, and those whom I have afflicted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the lame I will make the remnant; and those who were cast off, a strong nation; and the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pangs have seized you like a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now you shall go forth from the city and dwell in the open country; you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued, there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now many nations are assembled against you, saying, "Let her be profaned, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD, they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron and your hoofs bronze; you shall beat in pieces many peoples, and shall devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
