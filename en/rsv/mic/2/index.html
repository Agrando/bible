When the morning dawns, they perform it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away; they oppress a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, against this family I am devising evil, from which you cannot remove your necks; and you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be an evil time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you, and wail with bitter lamentation, and say, "We are utterly ruined; he changes the portion of my people; how he removes it from me! Among our captors he divides our fields."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Do not preach"--thus they preach--"one should not preach of such things; disgrace will not overtake us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you rise against my people as an enemy; you strip the robe from the peaceful, from those who pass by trustingly with no thought of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The women of my people you drive out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away my glory for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Arise and go, for this is no place to rest; because of uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If a man should go about and utter wind and lies, saying, "I will preach to you of wine and strong drink," he would be the preacher for this people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob, I will gather the remnant of Israel; I will set them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture, a noisy multitude of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who opens the breach will go up before them; they will break through and pass the gate, going out by it. Their king will pass on before them, the LORD at their head.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
