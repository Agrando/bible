And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezeki'ah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Thus shall you speak to Hezeki'ah king of Judah: `Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. And shall you be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations which my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharva'im, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Hezeki'ah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezeki'ah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezeki'ah prayed to the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, who art enthroned above the cherubim, thou art the God, thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Incline thy ear, O LORD, and hear; open thy eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennach'erib, which he has sent to mock the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of a truth, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they were destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou alone art the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezeki'ah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennach'erib king of Assyria,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: `She despises you, she scorns you-- the virgin daughter of Zion; she wags her head behind you-- the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>`Whom have you mocked and reviled? Against whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By your servants you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon; I felled its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses; I came to its remotest height, its densest forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I dug wells and drank waters, and I dried up with the sole of my foot all the streams of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`Have you not heard that I determined it long ago? I planned from days of old what now I bring to pass, that you should make fortified cities crash into heaps of ruins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, are dismayed and confounded, and have become like plants of the field and like tender grass, like grass on the housetops, blighted before it is grown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>`I know your sitting down and your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because you have raged against me and your arrogance has come to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will turn you back on the way by which you came.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"And this shall be the sign for you: this year eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs of the same; then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, or shoot an arrow there, or come before it with a shield, or cast up a siege mound against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the angel of the LORD went forth, and slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Sennach'erib king of Assyria departed, and went home and dwelt at Nin'eveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adram'melech and Share'zer, his sons, slew him with the sword, and escaped into the land of Ar'arat. And E'sar-had'don his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
