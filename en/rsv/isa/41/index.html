He gives up nations before him, so that he tramples kings under foot; he makes them like dust with his sword, like driven stubble with his bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He pursues them and passes on safely, by paths his feet have not trod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who has performed and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am He.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The coastlands have seen and are afraid, the ends of the earth tremble; they have drawn near and come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Every one helps his neighbor, and says to his brother, "Take courage!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, and he who smooths with the hammer him who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, "It is good"; and they fasten it with nails so that it cannot be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, "You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>fear not, for I am with you, be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, "Fear not, I will help you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel! I will help you, says the LORD; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, I will make of you a threshing sledge, new, sharp, and having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, and you shall make the hills like chaff;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest shall scatter them. And you shall rejoice in the LORD; in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue is parched with thirst, I the LORD will answer them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive; I will set in the desert the cypress, the plane and the pine together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that men may see and know, may consider and understand together, that the hand of the LORD has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Set forth your case, says the LORD; bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let them bring them, and tell us what is to happen. Tell us the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, that we may know their outcome; or declare to us the things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods; do good, or do harm, that we may be dismayed and terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, you are nothing, and your work is nought; an abomination is he who chooses you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I stirred up one from the north, and he has come, from the rising of the sun, and he shall call on my name; he shall trample on rulers as on mortar, as the potter treads clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Who declared it from the beginning, that we might know, and beforetime, that we might say, "He is right"? There was none who declared it, none who proclaimed, none who heard your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I first have declared it to Zion, and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when I look there is no one; among these there is no counselor who, when I ask, gives an answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, they are all a delusion; their works are nothing; their molten images are empty wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
