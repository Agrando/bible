Those who are weaned from the milk, those taken from the breast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nay, but by men of strange lips and with an alien tongue the LORD will speak to this people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>to whom he has said, "This is rest; give rest to the weary; and this is repose"; yet they would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore the word of the LORD will be to them precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers, who rule this people in Jerusalem!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol we have an agreement; when the overwhelming scourge passes through it will not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood we have taken shelter";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am laying in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation: `He who believes will not be in haste.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overwhelm the shelter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through you will be beaten down by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As often as it passes through it will take you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Pera'zim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; to do his deed-- strange is his deed! and to work his work-- alien is his work!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore do not scoff, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord GOD of hosts upon the whole land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Does he who plows for sowing plow continually? does he continually open and harrow his ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter dill, sow cummin, and put in wheat in rows and barley in its proper place, and spelt as the border?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he is instructed aright; his God teaches him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cummin; but dill is beaten out with a stick, and cummin with a rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Does one crush bread grain? No, he does not thresh it for ever; when he drives his cart wheel over it with his horses, he does not crush it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also comes from the LORD of hosts; he is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
