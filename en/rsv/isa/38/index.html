And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order; for you shall die, you shall not recover."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Hezeki'ah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said, "Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in thy sight." And Hezeki'ah wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Go and say to Hezeki'ah, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and defend this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"This is the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has promised:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps." So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A writing of Hezeki'ah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I said, In the noontide of my days I must depart; I am consigned to the gates of Sheol for the rest of my years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I said, I shall not see the LORD in the land of the living; I shall look upon man no more among the inhabitants of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd's tent; like a weaver I have rolled up my life; he cuts me off from the loom; from day to night thou dost bring me to an end;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I cry for help until morning; like a lion he breaks all my bones; from day to night thou dost bring me to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like a swallow or a crane I clamor, I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; be thou my security!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But what can I say? For he has spoken to me, and he himself has done it. All my sleep has fled because of the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these is the life of my spirit. Oh, restore me to health and make me live!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Lo, it was for my welfare that I had great bitterness; but thou hast held back my life from the pit of destruction, for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Sheol cannot thank thee, death cannot praise thee; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for thy faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The living, the living, he thanks thee, as I do this day; the father makes known to the children thy faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The LORD will save me, and we will sing to stringed instruments all the days of our life, at the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs, and apply it to the boil, that he may recover."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hezeki'ah also had said, "What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
