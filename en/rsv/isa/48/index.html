From this time forth I make you hear new things, hidden things which you have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, not long ago; before today you have never heard of them, lest you should say, `Behold, I knew them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You have never heard, you have never known, from of old your ear has not been opened. For I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and that from birth you were called a rebel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"For my name's sake I defer my anger, for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined you, but not like silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am He, I am the first, and I am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand forth together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Assemble, all of you, and hear! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, and his arm shall be against the Chalde'ans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have spoken and called him, I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Draw near to me, hear this: from the beginning I have not spoken in secret, from the time it came to be I have been there."
