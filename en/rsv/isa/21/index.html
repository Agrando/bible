As whirlwinds in the Negeb sweep on, it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A stern vision is told to me; the plunderer plunders, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam, lay siege, O Media; all the sighing she has caused I bring to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman in travail; I am bowed down so that I cannot hear, I am dismayed so that I cannot see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My mind reels, horror has appalled me; the twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They prepare the table, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink. Arise, O princes, oil the shield!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus the Lord said to me: "Go, set a watchman, let him announce what he sees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, riders on asses, riders on camels, let him listen diligently, very diligently."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he who saw cried: "Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord, continually by day, and at my post I am stationed whole nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, here come riders, horsemen in pairs!" And he answered, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the images of her gods he has shattered to the ground."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my threshed and winnowed one, what I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I announce to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The oracle concerning Dumah. One is calling to me from Se'ir, "Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman says: "Morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; come back again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The oracle concerning Arabia. In the thickets in Arabia you will lodge, O caravans of De'danites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>To the thirsty bring water, meet the fugitive with bread, O inhabitants of the land of Tema.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the press of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus the Lord said to me, "Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar will be few; for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
