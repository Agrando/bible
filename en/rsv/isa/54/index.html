For the children of the desolate one will be more than the children of her that is married, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; hold not back, lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left, and your descendants will possess the nations and will people the desolate cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Fear not, for you will not be ashamed; be not confounded, for you will not be put to shame; for you will forget the shame of your youth, and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For your Maker is your husband, the LORD of hosts is his name; and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer, the God of the whole earth he is called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the LORD has called you like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth when she is cast off, says your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the LORD, your Redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"For this is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed, says the LORD, who has compassion on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"O afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will make your pinnacles of agate, your gates of carbuncles, and all your wall of precious stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All your sons shall be taught by the LORD, and great shall be the prosperity of your sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any one stirs up strife, it is not from me; whoever stirs up strife with you shall fall because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and produces a weapon for its purpose.
