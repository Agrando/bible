And I said, "What shall I cry?" All flesh is grass, and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people is grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings, lift it up, fear not; say to the cities of Judah, "Behold your God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arms, he will carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or as his counselor has instructed him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whom did he consult for his enlightenment, and who taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as the dust on the scales; behold, he takes up the isles like fine dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lebanon would not suffice for fuel, nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the nations are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The idol! a workman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts for it silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who is impoverished chooses for an offering wood that will not rot; he seeks out a skilful craftsman to set up an image that will not move.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who brings princes to nought, and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth, when he blows upon them, and they wither, and the tempest carries them off like stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power not one is missing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, "My way is hid from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary, his understanding is unsearchable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even youths shall faint and be weary, and young men shall fall exhausted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
