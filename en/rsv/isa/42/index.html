Let the sea roar and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD goes forth like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his fury; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For a long time I have held my peace, I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in travail, I will gasp and pant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbage; I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will lead the blind in a way that they know not, in paths that they have not known I will guide them. I will turn the darkness before them into light, the rough places into level ground. These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They shall be turned back and utterly put to shame, who trust in graven images, who say to molten images, "You are our gods."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is blind but my servant, or deaf as my messenger whom I send? Who is blind as my dedicated one, or blind as the servant of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sees many things, but does not observe them; his ears are open, but he does not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The LORD was pleased, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify his law and make it glorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But this is a people robbed and plundered, they are all of them trapped in holes and hidden in prisons; they have become a prey with none to rescue, a spoil with none to say, "Restore!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who among you will give ear to this, will attend and listen for the time to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave up Jacob to the spoiler, and Israel to the robbers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, in whose ways they would not walk, and whose law they would not obey?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he poured upon him the heat of his anger and the might of battle; it set him on fire round about, but he did not understand; it burned him, but he did not take it to heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
