Then the LORD said to me, "Call his name Ma'her-shal'al-hash-baz;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for before the child knows how to cry `My father' or `My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Sama'ria will be carried away before the king of Assyria."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The LORD spoke to me again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Because this people have refused the waters of Shilo'ah that flow gently, and melt in fear before Rezin and the son of Remali'ah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory; and it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck; and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Imman'u-el."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be broken, you peoples, and be dismayed; give ear, all you far countries; gird yourselves and be dismayed; gird yourselves and be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take counsel together, but it will come to nought; speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Do not call conspiracy all that this people call conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the LORD of hosts, him you shall regard as holy; let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will become a sanctuary, and a stone of offense, and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And many shall stumble thereon; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they say to you, "Consult the mediums and the wizards who chirp and mutter," should not a people consult their God?
