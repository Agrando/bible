But I say, "I pine away, I pine away. Woe is me! For the treacherous deal treacherously, the treacherous deal very treacherously."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Terror, and the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who flees at the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit; and he who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows of heaven are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The earth is utterly broken, the earth is rent asunder, the earth is violently shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The earth staggers like a drunken man, it sways like a hut; its transgression lies heavy upon it, and it falls, and will not rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven, in heaven, and the kings of the earth, on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They will be gathered together as prisoners in a pit; they will be shut up in a prison, and after many days they will be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and before his elders he will manifest his glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
