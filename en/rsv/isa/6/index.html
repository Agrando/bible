For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having in his hand a burning coal which he had taken with tongs from the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he touched my mouth, and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin forgiven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here am I! Send me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, "Go, and say to this people: `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and see, but do not perceive.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I said, "How long, O Lord?" And he said: "Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the land is utterly desolate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the LORD removes men far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains standing when it is felled." The holy seed is its stump.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
