Hark, an uproar of kingdoms, of nations gathering together! The LORD of hosts is mustering a host for battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They come from a distant land, from the end of the heavens, the LORD and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; as destruction from the Almighty it will come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore all hands will be feeble, and every man's heart will melt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and they will be dismayed. Pangs and agony will seize them; they will be in anguish like a woman in travail. They will look aghast at one another; their faces will be aflame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the day of the LORD comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, to make the earth a desolation and to destroy its sinners from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be dark at its rising and the moon will not shed its light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant, and lay low the haughtiness of the ruthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will make men more rare than fine gold, and mankind than the gold of Ophir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place, at the wrath of the LORD of hosts in the day of his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And like a hunted gazelle, or like sheep with none to gather them, every man will turn to his own people, and every man will flee to his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever is found will be thrust through, and whoever is caught will fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Their infants will be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered and their wives ravished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, I am stirring up the Medes against them, who have no regard for silver and do not delight in gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their bows will slaughter the young men; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; their eyes will not pity children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the splendor and pride of the Chalde'ans, will be like Sodom and Gomor'rah when God overthrew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It will never be inhabited or dwelt in for all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherds will make their flocks lie down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But wild beasts will lie down there, and its houses will be full of howling creatures; there ostriches will dwell, and there satyrs will dance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hyenas will cry in its towers, and jackals in the pleasant palaces; its time is close at hand and its days will not be prolonged.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
