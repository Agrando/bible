Behold, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and comes to Egypt; and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence, and the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, and they will fight, every man against his brother and every man against his neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out, and I will confound their plans; and they will consult the idols and the sorcerers, and the mediums and the wizards;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard master; and a fierce king will rule over them, says the Lord, the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the waters of the Nile will be dried up, and the river will be parched and dry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and its canals will become foul, and the branches of Egypt's Nile will diminish and dry up, reeds and rushes will rot away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There will be bare places by the Nile, on the brink of the Nile, and all that is sown by the Nile will dry up, be driven away, and be no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The fishermen will mourn and lament, all who cast hook in the Nile; and they will languish who spread nets upon the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The workers in combed flax will be in despair, and the weavers of white cotton.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those who are the pillars of the land will be crushed, and all who work for hire will be grieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The princes of Zo'an are utterly foolish; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you and make known what the LORD of hosts has purposed against Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The princes of Zo'an have become fools, and the princes of Memphis are deluded; those who are the cornerstones of her tribes have led Egypt astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD has mingled within her a spirit of confusion; and they have made Egypt stagger in all her doings as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there will be nothing for Egypt which head or tail, palm branch or reed, may do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In that day the Egyptians will be like women, and tremble with fear before the hand which the LORD of hosts shakes over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians; every one to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose which the LORD of hosts has purposed against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt which speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts. One of these will be called the City of the Sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; when they cry to the LORD because of oppressors he will send them a savior, and will defend and deliver them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians; and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day and worship with sacrifice and burnt offering, and they will make vows to the LORD and perform them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD will smite Egypt, smiting and healing, and they will return to the LORD, and he will heed their supplications and heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my heritage."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
