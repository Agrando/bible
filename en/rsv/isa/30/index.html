Through a land of trouble and anguish, from where come the lioness and the lion, the viper and the flying serpent, they carry their riches on the backs of asses, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that cannot profit them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For Egypt's help is worthless and empty, therefore I have called her "Rahab who sits still."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now, go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come as a witness for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they are a rebellious people, lying sons, sons who will not hear the instruction of the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who say to the seers, "See not"; and to the prophets, "Prophesy not to us what is right; speak to us smooth things, prophesy illusions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>leave the way, turn aside from the path, let us hear no more of the Holy One of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a break in a high wall, bulging out, and about to collapse, whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and its breaking is like that of a potter's vessel which is smashed so ruthlessly that among its fragments not a sherd is found with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, "In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength." And you would not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but you said, "No! We will speed upon horses," therefore you shall speed away; and, "We will ride upon swift steeds," therefore your pursuers shall be swift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A thousand shall flee at the threat of one, at the threat of five you shall flee, till you are left like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, like a signal on a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you; therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you. For the LORD is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, O people in Zion who dwell at Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then you will defile your silver-covered graven images and your gold-plated molten images. You will scatter them as unclean things; you will say to them, "Begone!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and grain, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. In that day your cattle will graze in large pastures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and the oxen and the asses that till the ground will eat salted provender, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And upon every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when the LORD binds up the hurt of his people, and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke; his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>his breath is like an overflowing stream that reaches up to the neck; to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction, and to place on the jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the LORD will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst and tempest and hailstones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the LORD, when he smites with his rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And every stroke of the staff of punishment which the LORD lays upon them will be to the sound of timbrels and lyres; battling with brandished arm he will fight with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For a burning place has long been prepared; yea, for the king it is made ready, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, kindles it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
