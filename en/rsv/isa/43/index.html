I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because you are precious in my eyes, and honored, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Do not withhold; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>every one who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bring forth the people who are blind, yet have eyes, who are deaf, yet have ears!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let all the nations gather together, and let the peoples assemble. Who among them can declare this, and show us the former things? Let them bring their witnesses to justify them, and let them hear and say, It is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"You are my witnesses," says the LORD, "and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may know and believe me and understand that I am He.

I have not burdened you with offerings, or wearied you with frankincense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You have not bought me sweet cane with money, or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins, you have wearied me with your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Put me in remembrance, let us argue together; set forth your case, that you may be proved right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Your first father sinned, and your mediators transgressed against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, I delivered Jacob to utter destruction and Israel to reviling.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
