For the righteous man is taken away from calamity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>he enters into peace; they rest in their beds who walk in their uprightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But you, draw near hither, sons of the sorceress, offspring of the adulterer and the harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Of whom are you making sport? Against whom do you open your mouth wide and put out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, the offspring of deceit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>you who burn with lust among the oaks, under every green tree; who slay your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they, are your lot; to them you have poured out a drink offering, you have brought a cereal offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Upon a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed, and thither you went up to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your symbol; for, deserting me, you have uncovered your bed, you have gone up to it, you have made it wide; and you have made a bargain for yourself with them, you have loved their bed, you have looked on nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You journeyed to Molech with oil and multiplied your perfumes; you sent your envoys far off, and sent down even to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You were wearied with the length of your way, but you did not say, "It is hopeless"; you found new life for your strength, and so you were not faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whom did you dread and fear, so that you lied, and did not remember me, did not give me a thought? Have I not held my peace, even for a long time, and so you do not fear me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will tell of your righteousness and your doings, but they will not help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! The wind will carry them off, a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it shall be said, "Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every obstruction from my people's way."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: "I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will not contend for ever, nor will I always be angry; for from me proceeds the spirit, and I have made the breath of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, I smote him, I hid my face and was angry; but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and requite him with comfort, creating for his mourners the fruit of the lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Peace, peace, to the far and to the near, says the LORD; and I will heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked are like the tossing sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters toss up mire and dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
