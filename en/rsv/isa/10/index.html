To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ah, Assyria, the rod of my anger, the staff of my fury!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Against a godless nation I send him, and against the people of my wrath I command him, to take spoil and seize plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But he does not so intend, and his mind does not so think; but it is in his mind to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for he says: "Are not my commanders all kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not Calno like Car'chemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Sama'ria like Damascus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols whose graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Sama'ria,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Sama'ria and her images?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem he will punish the arrogant boasting of the king of Assyria and his haughty pride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he says: "By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; I have removed the boundaries of peoples, and have plundered their treasures; like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples; and as men gather eggs that have been forsaken so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing, or opened the mouth, or chirped."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall the axe vaunt itself over him who hews with it, or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield him who lifts it, or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors, and under his glory a burning will be kindled, like the burning of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The light of Israel will become a fire, and his Holy One a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land the LORD will destroy, both soul and body, and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean upon him that smote them, but will lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore thus says the Lord, the LORD of hosts: "O my people, who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrians when they smite with the rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For in a very little while my indignation will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD of hosts will wield against them a scourge, as when he smote Mid'ian at the rock of Oreb; and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke will be destroyed from your neck."  He has gone up from Rimmon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he has come to Ai'ath; he has passed through Migron, at Michmash he stores his baggage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>they have crossed over the pass, at Geba they lodge for the night; Ramah trembles, Gib'e-ah of Saul has fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cry aloud, O daughter of Gallim! Hearken, O La'ishah! Answer her, O An'athoth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Madme'nah is in flight, the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This very day he will halt at Nob, he will shake his fist at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts will lop the boughs with terrifying power; the great in height will be hewn down, and the lofty will be brought low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe, and Lebanon with its majestic trees will fall.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
