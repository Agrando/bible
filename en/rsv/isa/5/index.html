When I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and briers and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, a cry!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Woe to those who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is no more room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing: "Surely many houses shall be desolate, large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Woe to those who rise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink, who tarry late into the evening till wine inflames them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have lyre and harp, timbrel and flute and wine at their feasts; but they do not regard the deeds of the LORD, or see the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge; their honored men are dying of hunger, and their multitude is parched with thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth beyond measure, and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go down, her throng and he who exults in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Man is bowed down, and men are brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are humbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice, and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture, fatlings and kids shall feed among the ruins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, who draw sin as with cart ropes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who say: "Let him make haste, let him speed his work that we may see it; let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near, and let it come, that we may know it!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and shrewd in their own sight!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant men in mixing strong drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them and smote them, and the mountains quaked; and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He will raise a signal for a nation afar off, and whistle for it from the ends of the earth; and lo, swiftly, speedily it comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>None is weary, none stumbles, none slumbers or sleeps, not a waistcloth is loose, not a sandal-thong broken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>their arrows are sharp, all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like the whirlwind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Their roaring is like a lion, like young lions they roar; they growl and seize their prey, they carry it off, and none can rescue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They will growl over it on that day, like the roaring of the sea. And if one look to the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened by its clouds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
