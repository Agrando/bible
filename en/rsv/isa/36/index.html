And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And there came out to him Eli'akim the son of Hilki'ah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Jo'ah the son of Asaph, the recorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Rab'shakeh said to them, "Say to Hezeki'ah, `Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this confidence of yours?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? On whom do you now rely, that you have rebelled against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, you are relying on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if you say to me, "We rely on the LORD our God," is it not he whose high places and altars Hezeki'ah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You shall worship before this altar"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Eli'akim, Shebna, and Jo'ah said to the Rab'shakeh, "Pray, speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the Rab'shakeh said, "Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the Rab'shakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says the king: `Do not let Hezeki'ah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do not let Hezeki'ah make you rely on the LORD by saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not listen to Hezeki'ah; for thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me; then every one of you will eat of his own vine, and every one of his own fig tree, and every one of you will drink the water of his own cistern;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Beware lest Hezeki'ah mislead you by saying, "The LORD will deliver us." Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharva'im? Have they delivered Sama'ria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who among all the gods of these countries have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Eli'akim the son of Hilki'ah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Jo'ah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezeki'ah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of the Rab'shakeh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
