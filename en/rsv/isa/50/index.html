Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was put away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, by my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink for lack of water, and die of thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and make sackcloth their covering."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with a word him that is weary. Morning by morning he wakens, he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I turned not backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been confounded; therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>he who vindicates me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the Lord GOD helps me; who will declare me guilty? Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of his servant, who walks in darkness and has no light, yet trusts in the name of the LORD and relies upon his God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who set brands alight! Walk by the light of your fire, and by the brands which you have kindled! This shall you have from my hand: you shall lie down in torment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
