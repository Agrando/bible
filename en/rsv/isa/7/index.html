Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, a young woman shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Imman'u-el.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The LORD will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that E'phraim departed from Judah-- the king of Assyria."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day the LORD will whistle for the fly which is at the sources of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day the Lord will shave with a razor which is hired beyond the River-- with the king of Assyria-- the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and because of the abundance of milk which they give, he will eat curds; for every one that is left in the land will eat curds and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>With bow and arrows men will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and as for all the hills which used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
