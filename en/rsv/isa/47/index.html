For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Take the millstones and grind meal, put off your veil, strip off your robe, uncover your legs, pass through the rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Our Redeemer-- the LORD of hosts is his name-- is the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chalde'ans; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I was angry with my people, I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand, you showed them no mercy; on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You said, "I shall be mistress for ever," so that you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children":</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These two things shall come to you in a moment, in one day; the loss of children and widowhood shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You felt secure in your wickedness, you said, "No one sees me"; your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But evil shall come upon you, for which you cannot atone; disaster shall fall upon you, which you will not be able to expiate; and ruin shall come on you suddenly, of which you know nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, with which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you may be able to succeed, perhaps you may inspire terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You are wearied with your many counsels; let them stand forth and save you, those who divide the heavens, who gaze at the stars, who at the new moons predict what shall befall you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, they are like stubble, the fire consumes them; they cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. No coal for warming oneself is this, no fire to sit before!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Such to you are those with whom you have labored, who have trafficked with you from your youth; they wander about each in his own direction; there is no one to save you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
