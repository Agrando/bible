Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds of violence are in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, desolation and destruction are in their highways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The way of peace they know not, and there is no justice in their paths; they have made their roads crooked, no one who goes in them knows peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us; we look for light, and behold, darkness, and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We grope for the wall like the blind, we grope like those who have no eyes; we stumble at noon as in the twilight, among those in full vigor we are like dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We all growl like bears, we moan and moan like doves; we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>transgressing, and denying the LORD, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.  The LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intervene; then his own arm brought him victory, and his righteousness upheld him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in fury as a mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to their deeds, so will he repay, wrath to his adversaries, requital to his enemies; to the coastlands he will render requital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come like a rushing stream, which the wind of the LORD drives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"And he will come to Zion as Redeemer, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says the LORD: my spirit which is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your children, or out of the mouth of your children's children, says the LORD, from this time forth and for evermore."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
