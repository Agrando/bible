When the LORD stretches out his hand, the helper will stumble, and he who is helped will fall, and they will all perish together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus the LORD said to me, As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey, and when a band of shepherds is called forth against him is not terrified by their shouting or daunted at their noise, so the LORD of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Like birds hovering, so the LORD of hosts will protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver it, he will spare and rescue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Turn to him from whom you have deeply revolted, O people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For in that day every one shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have sinfully made for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man; and a sword, not of man, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be put to forced labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>His rock shall pass away in terror, and his officers desert the standard in panic," says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
