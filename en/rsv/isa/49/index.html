The LORD called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I said, "I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my right is with the LORD, and my recompense with my God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now the LORD says, who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him, for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD, and my God has become my strength--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he says: "It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel; I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One, to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations, the servant of rulers: "Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall prostrate themselves; because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus says the LORD: "In a time of favor I have answered you, in a day of salvation I have helped you; I have kept you and given you as a covenant to the people, to establish the land, to apportion the desolate heritages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>saying to the prisoners, `Come forth,' to those who are in darkness, `Appear.' They shall feed along the ways, on all bare heights shall be their pasture;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall smite them, for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be raised up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Lo, these shall come from afar, and lo, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Syene."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth; break forth, O mountains, into singing! For the LORD has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have graven you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your builders outstrip your destroyers, and those who laid you waste go forth from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lift up your eyes round about and see; they all gather, they come to you. As I live, says the LORD, you shall put them all on as an ornament, you shall bind them on as a bride does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Surely your waste and your desolate places and your devastated land-- surely now you will be too narrow for your inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The children born in the time of your bereavement will yet say in your ears: `The place is too narrow for me; make room for me to dwell in.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then you will say in your heart: `Who has borne me these? I was bereaved and barren, exiled and put away, but who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; whence then have these come?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and raise my signal to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you, and lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who wait for me shall not be put to shame."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Surely, thus says the LORD: "Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken, and the prey of the tyrant be rescued, for I will contend with those who contend with you, and I will save your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine. Then all flesh shall know that I am the LORD your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
