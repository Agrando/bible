Was it not thou that didst cut Rahab in pieces, that didst pierce the dragon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Was it not thou that didst dry up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that didst make the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"I, I am he that comforts you; who are you that you are afraid of man who dies, of the son of man who is made like grass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he sets himself to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He who is bowed down shall speedily be released; he shall not die and go down to the Pit, neither shall his bread fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar-- the LORD of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have put my words in your mouth, and hid you in the shadow of my hand, stretching out the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth, and saying to Zion, `You are my people.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Rouse yourself, rouse yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, who have drunk to the dregs the bowl of staggering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne; there is none to take her by the hand among all the sons she has brought up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These two things have befallen you-- who will condole with you?-- devastation and destruction, famine and sword; who will comfort you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted, who are drunk, but not with wine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says your Lord, the LORD, your God who pleads the cause of his people: "Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering; the bowl of my wrath you shall drink no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, who have said to you, `Bow down, that we may pass over'; and you have made your back like the ground and like the street for them to pass over."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
