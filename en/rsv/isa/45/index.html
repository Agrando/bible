Does the clay say to him who fashions it, `What are you making'? or `Your work has no handles'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe to him who says to a father, `What are you begetting?' or to a woman, `With what are you in travail?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: "Will you question me about my children, or command me concerning the work of my hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I made the earth, and created man upon it; it was my hands that stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have aroused him in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build my city and set my exiles free, not for price or reward," says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says the LORD: "The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabe'ans, men of stature, shall come over to you and be yours, they shall follow you; they shall come over in chains and bow down to you. They will make supplication to you, saying: `God is with you only, and there is no other, no god besides him.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly, thou art a God who hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>All of them are put to shame and confounded, the makers of idols go in confusion together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Israel is saved by the LORD with everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it a chaos, he formed it to be inhabited!): "I am the LORD, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I did not speak in secret, in a land of darkness; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob, `Seek me in chaos.' I the LORD speak the truth, I declare what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, you survivors of the nations! They have no knowledge who carry about their wooden idols, and keep on praying to a god that cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together! Who told this long ago? Who declared it of old? Was it not I, the LORD? And there is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By myself I have sworn, from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall not return: `To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength; to him shall come and be ashamed, all who were incensed against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall triumph and glory."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
