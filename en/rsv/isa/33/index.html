When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed; and when you have made an end of dealing treacherously, you will be dealt with treacherously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>O LORD, be gracious to us; we wait for thee. Be our arm every morning, our salvation in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>At the thunderous noise peoples flee, at the lifting up of thyself nations are scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers; as locusts leap, men leap upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The LORD is exalted, for he dwells on high; he will fill Zion with justice and righteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and he will be the stability of your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is his treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, the valiant ones cry without; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases. Covenants are broken, witnesses are despised, there is no regard for man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Now I will arise," says the LORD, "now I will lift myself up; now I will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You conceive chaff, you bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that will consume you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the peoples will be as if burned to lime, like thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge my might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless: "Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands, lest they hold a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>he will dwell on the heights; his place of defense will be the fortresses of rocks; his bread will be given him, his water will be sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will behold a land that stretches afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your mind will muse on the terror: "Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed the tribute? Where is he who counted the towers?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will see no more the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech which you cannot comprehend, stammering in a tongue which you cannot understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, an immovable tent, whose stakes will never be plucked up, nor will any of its cords be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But there the LORD in majesty will be for us a place of broad rivers and streams, where no galley with oars can go, nor stately ship can pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our ruler, the LORD is our king; he will save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your tackle hangs loose; it cannot hold the mast firm in its place, or keep the sail spread out.  Then prey and spoil in abundance will be divided; even the lame will take the prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And no inhabitant will say, "I am sick"; the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
