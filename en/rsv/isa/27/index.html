Lest any one harm it, I guard it night and day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have no wrath. Would that I had thorns and briers to battle! I would set out against them, I would burn them up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or let them lay hold of my protection, let them make peace with me, let them make peace with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In days to come Jacob shall take root, Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots, and fill the whole world with fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Has he smitten them as he smote those who smote them?

For this is a people without discernment; therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, he that formed them will show them no favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day from the river Euphra'tes to the Brook of Egypt the LORD will thresh out the grain, and you will be gathered one by one, O people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
