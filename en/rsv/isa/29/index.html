Add year to year; let the feasts run their round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be moaning and lamentation, and she shall be to me like an Ariel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will encamp against you round about, and will besiege you with towers and I will raise siegeworks against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then deep from the earth you shall speak, from low in the dust your words shall come; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the multitude of your foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the ruthless like passing chaff. And in an instant, suddenly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>you will be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, all that fight against her and her stronghold and distress her, shall be like a dream, a vision of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As when a hungry man dreams he is eating and awakes with his hunger not satisfied, or as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking and awakes faint, with his thirst not quenched, so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Stupefy yourselves and be in a stupor, blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with strong drink!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the LORD has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets, and covered your heads, the seers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, "Read this," he says, "I cannot, for it is sealed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, "Read this," he says, "I cannot read."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Lord said: "Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men learned by rote;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore, behold, I will again do marvelous things with this people, wonderful and marvelous; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to those who hide deep from the LORD their counsel, whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us? Who knows us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay; that the thing made should say of its maker, "He did not make me"; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, "He has no understanding"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the ruthless shall come to nought and the scoffer cease, and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who by a word make a man out to be an offender, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: "Jacob shall no more be ashamed, no more shall his face grow pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And those who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will accept instruction."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
