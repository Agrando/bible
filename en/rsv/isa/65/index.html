I said, "Here am I, here am I," to a nation that did not call on my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and burning incense upon bricks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who sit in tombs, and spend the night in secret places; who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who say, "Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am set apart from you." These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, it is written before me: "I will not keep silent, but I will repay, yea, I will repay into their bosom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>their iniquities and their fathers' iniquities together, says the LORD; because they burned incense upon the mountains and reviled me upon the hills, I will measure into their bosom payment for their former doings."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus says the LORD: "As the wine is found in the cluster, and they say, `Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,' so I will do for my servants' sake, and not destroy them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah inheritors of my mountains; my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for my people who have sought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter; because, when I called, you did not answer, when I spoke, you did not listen, but you did what was evil in my eyes, and chose what I did not delight in."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, but you shall cry out for pain of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse, and the Lord GOD will slay you; but his servants he will call by a different name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth, and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hid from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and be glad in my people; no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days, for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity; for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD, and their children with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food.
