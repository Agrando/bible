They have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why will you still be smitten, that you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and bleeding wounds; they are not pressed out, or bound up, or softened with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by aliens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we should have been like Sodom, and become like Gomor'rah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Give ear to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomor'rah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"When you come to appear before me, who requires of you this trampling of my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath and the calling of assemblies-- I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How the faithful city has become a harlot, she that was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Every one loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not defend the fatherless, and the widow's cause does not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore the Lord says, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "Ah, I will vent my wrath on my enemies, and avenge myself on my foes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But rebels and sinners shall be destroyed together, and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For you shall be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted; and you shall blush for the gardens which you have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall become tow, and his work a spark, and both of them shall burn together, with none to quench them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
