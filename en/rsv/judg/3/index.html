Then Oth'ni-el the son of Kenaz died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amal'ekites, and went and defeated Israel; and they took possession of the city of palms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the people of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it on his right thigh under his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people that carried the tribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he commanded, "Silence." And all his attendants went out from his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ehud came to him, as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went out into the vestibule, and closed the doors of the roof chamber upon him, and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When he had gone, the servants came; and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, "He is only relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they waited till they were utterly at a loss; but when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them; and there lay their lord dead on the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the sculptured stones, and escaped to Se-i'rah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of E'phraim; and the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, having him at their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, "Follow after me; for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand." So they went down after him, and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and allowed not a man to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they killed at that time about ten thousand of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred of the Philistines with an oxgoad; and he too delivered Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
