And Gideon tested them; twenty-two thousand returned, and ten thousand remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many; take them down to the water and I will test them for you there; and he of whom I say to you, `This man shall go with you,' shall go with you; and any of whom I say to you, `This man shall not go with you,' shall not go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he brought the people down to the water; and the LORD said to Gideon, "Every one that laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself; likewise every one that kneels down to drink."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the number of those that lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Mid'ianites into your hand; and let all the others go every man to his home."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So he took the jars of the people from their hands, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Mid'ian was below him in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That same night the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp; for I have given it into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if you fear to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp." Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men that were in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Mid'ianites and the Amal'ekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the seashore for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade; and he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream; and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Mid'ian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his comrade answered, "This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Jo'ash, a man of Israel; into his hand God has given Mid'ian and all the host."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped; and he returned to the camp of Israel, and said, "Arise; for the LORD has given the host of Mid'ian into your hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, "Look at me, and do likewise; when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, `For the LORD and for Gideon.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars, holding in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow; and they cried, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They stood every man in his place round about the camp, and all the army ran; they cried out and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they blew the three hundred trumpets, the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shit'tah toward Zer'erah, as far as the border of A'bel-meho'lah, by Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel were called out from Naph'tali and from Asher and from all Manas'seh, and they pursued after Mid'ian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of E'phraim, saying, "Come down against the Mid'ianites and seize the waters against them, as far as Beth-bar'ah, and also the Jordan." So all the men of E'phraim were called out, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-bar'ah, and also the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took the two princes of Mid'ian, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press of Zeeb, as they pursued Mid'ian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
