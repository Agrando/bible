Gilead was the father of Jephthah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Gilead's wife also bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they thrust Jephthah out, and said to him, "You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and worthless fellows collected round Jephthah, and went raiding with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our leader, that we may fight with the Ammonites."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "That is why we have turned to you now, that you may go with us and fight with the Ammonites, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me home again to fight with the Ammonites, and the LORD gives them over to me, I will be your head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD will be witness between us; we will surely do as you say."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and said, "What have you against me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel on coming from Egypt took away my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore it peaceably."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said to him, "Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, `Let us pass, we pray, through your land'; but the king of Edom would not listen. And they sent also to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they journeyed through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and arrived on the east side of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Israel then sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, `Let us pass, we pray, through your land to our country.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped at Jahaz, and fought with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; so Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So then the LORD, the God of Israel, dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel; and are you to take possession of them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Will you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? And all that the LORD our God has dispossessed before us, we will possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever go to war with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aro'er and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I therefore have not sinned against you, and you do me wrong by making war on me; the LORD, the Judge, decide this day between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the king of the Ammonites did not heed the message of Jephthah which he sent to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manas'seh, and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD, and said, "If thou wilt give the Ammonites into my hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>then whoever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return victorious from the Ammonites, shall be the LORD's, and I will offer him up for a burnt offering."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them; and the LORD gave them into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he smote them from Aro'er to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a very great slaughter. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances; she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he saw her, he rent his clothes, and said, "Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble to me; for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot take back my vow."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And she said to him, "My father, if you have opened your mouth to the LORD, do to me according to what has gone forth from your mouth, now that the LORD has avenged you on your enemies, on the Ammonites."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, "Go." And he sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had made. She had never known a man. And it became a custom in Israel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>that the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
