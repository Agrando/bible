And they upbraided him violently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of E'phraim better than the vintage of Abi-e'zer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God has given into your hands the princes of Mid'ian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger against him was abated, when he had said this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, faint yet pursuing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he said to the men of Succoth, "Pray, give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmun'na, the kings of Mid'ian."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the officials of Succoth said, "Are Zebah and Zalmun'na already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Gideon said, "Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmun'na into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And from there he went up to Penu'el, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penu'el answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to the men of Penu'el, "When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Zebah and Zalmun'na were in Karkor with their army, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for there had fallen a hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Gideon went up by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jog'behah, and attacked the army; for the army was off its guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Zebah and Zalmun'na fled; and he pursued them and took the two kings of Mid'ian, Zebah and Zalmun'na, and he threw all the army into a panic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Gideon the son of Jo'ash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he caught a young man of Succoth, and questioned him; and he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, "Behold Zebah and Zalmun'na, about whom you taunted me, saying, `Are Zebah and Zalmun'na already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are faint?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he took the elders of the city and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he broke down the tower of Penu'el, and slew the men of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he said to Zebah and Zalmun'na, "Where are the men whom you slew at Tabor?" They answered, "As you are, so were they, every one of them; they resembled the sons of a king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to Jether his first-born, "Rise, and slay them." But the youth did not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zebah and Zalmun'na said, "Rise yourself, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength." And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and Zalmun'na; and he took the crescents that were on the necks of their camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also; for you have delivered us out of the hand of Mid'ian."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you; give me every man of you the earrings of his spoil." (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ish'maelites.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they answered, "We will willingly give them." And they spread a garment, and every man cast in it the earrings of his spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold; besides the crescents and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Mid'ian, and besides the collars that were about the necks of their camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah; and all Israel played the harlot after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Mid'ian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jerubba'al the son of Jo'ash went and dwelt in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abim'elech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Gideon the son of Jo'ash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Jo'ash his father, at Ophrah of the Abiez'rites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and played the harlot after the Ba'als, and made Ba'al-be'rith their god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the hand of all their enemies on every side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they did not show kindness to the family of Jerubba'al (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
