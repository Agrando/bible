So Simeon went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Per'izzites into their hand; and they defeated ten thousand of them at Bezek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They came upon Ado'ni-be'zek at Bezek, and fought against him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Per'izzites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ado'ni-be'zek fled; but they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Ado'ni-be'zek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their great toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has requited me." And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kir'iath-ar'ba); and they defeated She'shai and Ahi'man and Talmai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kir'iath-se'pher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Caleb said, "He who attacks Kir'iath-se'pher and takes it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Oth'ni-el the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field; and she alighted from her ass, and Caleb said to her, "What do you wish?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She said to him, "Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the descendants of the Ken'ite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad; and they went and settled with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Judah also took Gaza with its territory, and Ash'kelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had chariots of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said; and he drove out from it the three sons of Anak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jeb'usites who dwelt in Jerusalem; so the Jeb'usites have dwelt with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel; and the LORD was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, "Pray, show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he showed them the way into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city, and called its name Luz; that is its name to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Manas'seh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-she'an and its villages, or Ta'a-nach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megid'do and its villages; but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And E'phraim did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Zeb'ulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Na'halol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to forced labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Naph'tali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-she'mesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-she'mesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Har-heres, in Ai'jalon, and in Sha-al'bim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily upon them, and they became subject to forced labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrab'bim, from Sela and upward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
