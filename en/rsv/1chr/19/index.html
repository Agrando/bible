So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites, to console him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, "Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, "Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopota'mia, from Aram-ma'acah, and from Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Ma'acah with his army, who came and encamped before Med'eba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When David heard of it, he sent Jo'ab and all the army of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jo'ab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Syrians;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abi'shai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, "If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what seems good to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jo'ab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle; and they fled before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abi'shai, Jo'ab's brother, and entered the city. Then Jo'ab came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphra'tes, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadade'zer at their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and crossed the Jordan, and came to them, and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand foot soldiers, and killed also Shophach the commander of their army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the servants of Hadade'zer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to help the Ammonites any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
