Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>David said, "Whoever shall smite the Jeb'usites first shall be chief and commander." And Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah went up first, so he became chief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he built the city round about from the Millo in complete circuit; and Jo'ab repaired the rest of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now these are the chiefs of David's mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is an account of David's mighty men: Jasho'be-am, a Hach'monite, was chief of the three; he wielded his spear against three hundred whom he slew at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And next to him among the three mighty men was Elea'zar the son of Dodo, the Aho'hite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was with David at Pas-dam'mim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Reph'aim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said longingly, "O that some one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took and brought it to David. But David would not drink of it; he poured it out to the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and said, "Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Abi'shai, the brother of Jo'ab, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and slew them, and won a name beside the three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He was the most renowned of the thirty, and became their commander; but he did not attain to the three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds; he smote two ariels of Moab. He also went down and slew a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam; but Benai'ah went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These things did Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and won a name beside the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three.
