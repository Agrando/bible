But David remained at Jerusalem. And Jo'ab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David took the crown of their king from his head; he found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he brought forth the people who were in it, and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes; and thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And after this there arose war with the Philistines at Gezer; then Sib'becai the Hu'shathite slew Sip'pai, who was one of the descendants of the giants; and the Philistines were subdued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elha'nan the son of Ja'ir slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was descended from the giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shim'e-a, David's brother, slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These were descended from the giants in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
