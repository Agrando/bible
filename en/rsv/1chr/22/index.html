So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>David said to Solomon, "My son, I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, `You have shed much blood and have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood before me upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, a son shall be born to you; he shall be a man of peace. I will give him peace from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall build a house for my name. He shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel for ever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, my son, the LORD be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as he has spoken concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Only, may the LORD grant you discretion and understanding, that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong, and of good courage. Fear not; be not dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With great pains I have provided for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, a million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing, for there is so much of it; timber and stone too I have provided. To these you must add.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You have an abundance of workmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of craftsmen without number, skilled in working</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and be doing! The LORD be with you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not given you peace on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD and his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now set your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God. Arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the LORD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
