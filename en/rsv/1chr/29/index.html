Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the LORD?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the heads of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king's work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in the care of Jehi'el the Gershonite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the people rejoiced because these had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the LORD; David the king also rejoiced greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly; and David said: "Blessed art thou, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Both riches and honor come from thee, and thou rulest over all. In thy hand are power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now we thank thee, our God, and praise thy glorious name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from thee, and of thy own have we given thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building thee a house for thy holy name comes from thy hand and is all thy own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I know, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness; in the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen thy people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep for ever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of thy people, and direct their hearts toward thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Grant to Solomon my son that with a whole heart he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, performing all, and that he may build the palace for which I have made provision."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David said to all the assembly, "Bless the LORD your God." And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and did obeisance to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they performed sacrifices to the LORD, and on the next day offered burnt offerings to the LORD, a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness.  And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him as prince for the LORD, and Zadok as priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father; and he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD gave Solomon great repute in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of Gad the seer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances that came upon him and upon Israel, and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
