Moreover I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When your days are fulfilled to go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son; I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for ever.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and said, "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast shown me future generations, O LORD God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And what more can David say to thee for honoring thy servant? For thou knowest thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thy servant's sake, O LORD, and according to thy own heart, thou hast wrought all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There is none like thee, O LORD, and there is no God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What other nation on earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his people, making for thyself a name for great and terrible things, in driving out nations before thy people whom thou didst redeem from Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou didst make thy people Israel to be thy people for ever; and thou, O LORD, didst become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now, O LORD, let the word which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and thy name will be established and magnified for ever, saying, `The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God,' and the house of thy servant David will be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For thou, my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build a house for him; therefore thy servant has found courage to pray before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, O LORD, thou art God, and thou hast promised this good thing to thy servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>now therefore may it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for what thou, O LORD, hast blessed is blessed for ever."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
