But his armor-bearer would not; for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword, and fell upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilbo'a.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when all Ja'besh-gil'ead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore the LORD slew him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
