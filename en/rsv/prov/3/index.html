bind them about your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So you will find favor and good repute in the sight of God and man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not rely on your own insight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honor the LORD with your substance and with the first fruits of all your produce;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for the gain from it is better than gain from silver and its profit better than gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called happy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by his knowledge the deeps broke forth, and the clouds drop down the dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, keep sound wisdom and discretion; let them not escape from your sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then you will walk on your way securely and your foot will not stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If you sit down, you will not be afraid;
