The man says to Ith'i-el, to Ith'i-el and Ucal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Surely I am too stupid to be a man. I have not the understanding of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name? Surely you know!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you, and you be found a liar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Two things I ask of thee; deny them not to me before I die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, "Who is the LORD?" or lest I be poor, and steal, and profane the name of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There are those who are pure in their own eyes but are not cleansed of their filth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There are those--how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There are those whose teeth are swords, whose teeth are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The leech has two daughters; "Give, give," they cry. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough":</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Sheol, the barren womb, the earth ever thirsty for water, and the fire which never says, "Enough."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a maiden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is the way of an adulteress: she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, "I have done no wrong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maid when she succeeds her mistress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the rocks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the lion, which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the strutting cock, the he-goat, and a king striding before his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
