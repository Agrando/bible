Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it, and will he not requite man according to his work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My son, eat honey, for it is good, and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Know that wisdom is such to your soul; if you find it, there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous; do not violence to his home;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>lest the LORD see it, and be displeased, and turn away his anger from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Fret not yourself because of evildoers, and be not envious of the wicked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not disobey either of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for disaster from them will rise suddenly, and who knows the ruin that will come from them both?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These also are sayings of the wise.
