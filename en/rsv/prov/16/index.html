to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The highway of the upright turns aside from evil; he who guards his way preserves his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide the spoil with the proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who gives heed to the word will prosper, and happy is he who trusts in the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wise of heart is called a man of discernment, and pleasant speech increases persuasiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wisdom is a fountain of life to him who has it, but folly is the chastisement of fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The mind of the wise makes his speech judicious, and adds persuasiveness to his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A worker's appetite works for him;

it is gained in a righteous life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The lot is cast into the lap, but the decision is wholly from the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
