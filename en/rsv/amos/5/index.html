They shall call the farmers to mourning and to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and in all vineyards there shall be wailing, for I will pass through the midst of you," says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Woe to you who desire the day of the LORD! Why would you have the day of the LORD? It is darkness, and not light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>as if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned with his hand against the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Is not the day of the LORD darkness, and not light, and gloom with no brightness in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"I hate, I despise your feasts, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and cereal offerings, I will not accept them, and the peace offerings of your fatted beasts I will not look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take away from me the noise of your songs; to the melody of your harps I will not listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You shall take up Sakkuth your king, and Kaiwan your star-god, your images, which you made for yourselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>therefore I will take you into exile beyond Damascus," says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
