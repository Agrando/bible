How can Jacob stand? He is so small!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The LORD repented concerning this; "It shall not be," said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus the Lord GOD showed me: behold, the Lord GOD was calling for a judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I said, "O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The LORD repented concerning this; "This also shall not be," said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to me, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "Behold, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass by them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jerobo'am with the sword."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Amazi'ah the priest of Bethel sent to Jerobo'am king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thus Amos has said, `Jerobo'am shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Amazi'ah said to Amos, "O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Amos answered Amazi'ah, "I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, `Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Now therefore hear the word of the LORD. You say, `Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore thus says the LORD: `Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be parceled out by line; you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
