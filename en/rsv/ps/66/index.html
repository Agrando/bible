A Song. A Psalm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Say to God, "How terrible are thy deeds! So great is thy power that thy enemies cringe before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All the earth worships thee; they sing praises to thee, sing praises to thy name." [Selah]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Come and see what God has done: he is terrible in his deeds among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He turned the sea into dry land; men passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>who rules by his might for ever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations-- let not the rebellious exalt themselves. [Selah]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Bless our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who has kept us among the living, and has not let our feet slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thou, O God, hast tested us; thou hast tried us as silver is tried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou didst bring us into the net; thou didst lay affliction on our loins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>thou didst let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet thou hast brought us forth to a spacious place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will come into thy house with burnt offerings; I will pay thee my vows,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will offer to thee burnt offerings of fatlings, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. [Selah]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I cried aloud to him, and he was extolled with my tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But truly God has listened; he has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
