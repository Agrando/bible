Can he also give bread, or provide meat for his people?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob, his anger mounted against Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because they had no faith in God, and did not trust his saving power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he rained down upon them manna to eat, and gave them the grain of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he rained flesh upon them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But before they had sated their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the anger of God rose against them and he slew the strongest of them, and laid low the picked men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In spite of all this they still sinned; despite his wonders they did not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When he slew them, they sought for him; they repented and sought God earnestly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not true to his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Yet he, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often, and did not stir up all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They tested him again and again, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>They did not keep in mind his power, or the day when he redeemed them from the foe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>when he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the fields of Zo'an.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He gave their crops to the caterpillar, and the fruit of their labor to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He let loose on them his fierce anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He smote all the first-born in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then he led forth his people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God, and did not observe his testimonies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>He gave his people over to the sword, and vented his wrath on his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Fire devoured their young men, and their maidens had no marriage song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>He rejected the tent of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of E'phraim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>from tending the ewes that had young he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob his people, of Israel his inheritance. [ (Psalms 78:73) With upright heart he tended them, and guided them with skilful hand. ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
