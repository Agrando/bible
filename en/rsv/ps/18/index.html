A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD, who addressed the words of this song to the LORD on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I love thee, O LORD, my strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cords of death encompassed me, the torrents of perdition assailed me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>the cords of Sheol entangled me, the snares of death confronted me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He bowed the heavens, and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He rode on a cherub, and flew; he came swiftly upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He made darkness his covering around him, his canopy thick clouds dark with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Out of the brightness before him there broke through his clouds hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings, and routed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He reached from on high, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came upon me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He brought me forth into a broad place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the loyal thou dost show thyself loyal; with the blameless man thou dost show thyself blameless;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>with the pure thou dost show thyself pure; and with the crooked thou dost show thyself perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thou dost deliver a humble people; but the haughty eyes thou dost bring down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yea, thou dost light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yea, by thee I can crush a troop; and by my God I can leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>This God--his way is perfect; the promise of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>the God who girded me with strength, and made my way safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He made my feet like hinds' feet, and set me secure on the heights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand supported me, and thy help made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou didst give a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I pursued my enemies and overtook them; and did not turn back till they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thou didst gird me with strength for the battle; thou didst make my assailants sink under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thou didst make my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They cried for help, but there was none to save, they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thou didst deliver me from strife with the peoples; thou didst make me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Foreigners lost heart, and came trembling out of their fastnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>who delivered me from my enemies; yea, thou didst exalt me above my adversaries; thou didst deliver me from men of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For this I will extol thee, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to thy name. [ (Psalms 18:51) Great triumphs he gives to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his descendants for ever. ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
