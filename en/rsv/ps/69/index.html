A Psalm of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; mighty are those who would destroy me, those who attack me with lies. What I did not steal must I now restore?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O God, thou knowest my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let not those who hope in thee be put to shame through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; let not those who seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For it is for thy sake that I have borne reproach, that shame has covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have become a stranger to my brethren, an alien to my mother's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For zeal for thy house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult thee have fallen on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When I humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O LORD. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of thy steadfast love answer me. With thy faithful help</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>rescue me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Answer me, O LORD, for thy steadfast love is good; according to thy abundant mercy, turn to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in distress, make haste to answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Draw near to me, redeem me, set me free because of my enemies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor; my foes are all known to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Insults have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their own table before them become a snare; let their sacrificial feasts be a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and make their loins tremble continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy burning anger overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>May their camp be a desolation, let no one dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and him whom thou hast wounded, they afflict still more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But I am afflicted and in pain; let thy salvation, O God, set me on high!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Let the oppressed see it and be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the LORD hears the needy, and does not despise his own that are in bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; and his servants shall dwell there and possess it; [ (Psalms 69:37) the children of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell in it. ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
