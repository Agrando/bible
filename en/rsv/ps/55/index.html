I am distraught</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>by the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bring trouble upon me, and in anger they cherish enmity against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My heart is in anguish within me, the terrors of death have fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I say, "O that I had wings like a dove!
