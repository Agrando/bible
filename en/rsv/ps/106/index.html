O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty doings of the LORD, or show forth all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O LORD, when thou showest favor to thy people; help me when thou deliverest them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider thy wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of thy steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most High at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; and he led them through the deep as through a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he saved them from the hand of the foe, and delivered them from the power of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abi'ram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and would disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them over the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they attached themselves to the Ba'al of Pe'or, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>they provoked the LORD to anger with their doings, and a plague broke out among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Phin'ehas stood up and interposed, and the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And that has been reckoned to him as righteousness from generation to generation for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered him at the waters of Mer'ibah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke words that were rash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but they mingled with the nations and learned to do as they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They served their idols, which became a snare to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the harlot in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes, and were brought low through their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He remembered for their sake his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
