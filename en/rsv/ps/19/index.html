A Psalm of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>yet their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>which comes forth like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and like a strong man runs its course with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them; and there is nothing hid from its heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; the ordinances of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover by them is thy servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression. [ (Psalms 19:15) Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer. ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
