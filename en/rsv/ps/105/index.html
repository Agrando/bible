let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his presence continually!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember the wonderful works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O offspring of Abraham his servant, sons of Jacob, his chosen ones!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He is mindful of his covenant for ever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>the covenant which he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When he summoned a famine on the land, and broke every staff of bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>until what he had said came to pass the word of the LORD tested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king sent and released him, the ruler of the peoples set him free;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>he made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>to instruct his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD made his people very fruitful, and made them stronger than their foes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They wrought his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they rebelled against his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He gave them hail for rain, and lightning that flashed through their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He smote their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He spoke, and the locusts came, and young locusts without number;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>which devoured all the vegetation in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He smote all the first-born in their land, the first issue of all their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he led forth Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They asked, and he brought quails, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He opened the rock, and water gushed forth; it flowed through the desert like a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So he led forth his people with joy, his chosen ones with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he gave them the lands of the nations; and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>to the end that they should keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
