Is there knowledge in the Most High?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For all the day long I have been stricken, and chastened every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have been untrue to the generation of thy children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I perceived their end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Truly thou dost set them in slippery places; thou dost make them fall to ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They are like a dream when one awakes, on awaking you despise their phantoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was stupid and ignorant, I was like a beast toward thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou dost hold my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou dost guide me with thy counsel, and afterward thou wilt receive me to glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is nothing upon earth that I desire besides thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For lo, those who are far from thee shall perish; thou dost put an end to those who are false to thee. [ (Psalms 73:29) But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all thy works. ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
