A Psalm of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>O LORD, thou hast searched me and known me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou knowest when I sit down and when I rise up; thou discernest my thoughts from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even before a word is on my tongue, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou dost beset me behind and before, and layest thy hand upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If I ascend to heaven, thou art there! If I make my bed in Sheol, thou art there!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>even there thy hand shall lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I say, "Let only darkness cover me, and the light about me be night,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>even the darkness is not dark to thee, the night is bright as the day; for darkness is as light with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thou didst form my inward parts, thou didst knit me together in my mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I praise thee, for thou art fearful and wonderful. Wonderful are thy works! Thou knowest me right well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>my frame was not hidden from thee, when I was being made in secret, intricately wrought in the depths of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thy eyes beheld my unformed substance; in thy book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>How precious to me are thy thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If I would count them, they are more than the sand. When I awake, I am still with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O that thou wouldst slay the wicked, O God, and that men of blood would depart from me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>men who maliciously defy thee, who lift themselves up against thee for evil!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do I not hate them that hate thee, O LORD? And do I not loathe them that rise up against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! [ (Psalms 139:25) And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting! ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
