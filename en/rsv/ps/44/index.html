A Maskil of the Sons of Korah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what deeds thou didst perform in their days, in the days of old:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>thou with thy own hand didst drive out the nations, but them thou didst plant; thou didst afflict the peoples, but them thou didst set free;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm give them victory; but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance; for thou didst delight in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou art my King and my God, who ordainest victories for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Through thee we push down our foes; through thy name we tread down our assailants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But thou hast saved us from our foes, and hast put to confusion those who hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to thy name for ever.

Why dost thou forget our affliction and oppression?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our body cleaves to the ground.
