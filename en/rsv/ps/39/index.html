A Psalm of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I said, "I will guard my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue; I will bridle my mouth, so long as the wicked are in my presence."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I was dumb and silent, I held my peace to no avail; my distress grew worse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>my heart became hot within me. As I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"LORD, let me know my end, and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, thou hast made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing in thy sight. Surely every man stands as a mere breath! [Selah]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Surely man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nought are they in turmoil; man heaps up, and knows not who will gather!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Deliver me from all my transgressions. Make me not the scorn of the fool!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am dumb, I do not open my mouth; for it is thou who hast done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Remove thy stroke from me; I am spent by the blows of thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When thou dost chasten man with rebukes for sin, thou dost consume like a moth what is dear to him; surely every man is a mere breath! [Selah]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears! For I am thy passing guest, a sojourner, like all my fathers. [ (Psalms 39:14) Look away from me, that I may know gladness, before I depart and be no more!" ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
