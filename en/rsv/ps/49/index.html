A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>both low and high, rich and poor together!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of my persecutors surrounds me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>men who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Truly no man can ransom himself, or give to God the price of his life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for the ransom of his life is costly, and can never suffice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that he should continue to live on for ever, and never see the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yea, he shall see that even the wise die, the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Their graves are their homes for ever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they named lands their own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Man cannot abide in his pomp, he is like the beasts that perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is the fate of those who have foolish confidence, the end of those who are pleased with their portion. [Selah]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; straight to the grave they descend, and their form shall waste away; Sheol shall be their home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. [Selah]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be not afraid when one becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Though, while he lives, he counts himself happy, and though a man gets praise when he does well for himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>he will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never more see the light. [ (Psalms 49:21) Man cannot abide in his pomp, he is like the beasts that perish. ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
