A Psalm of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He drew me up from the desolate pit, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after false gods!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou hast multiplied, O LORD my God, thy wondrous deeds and thy thoughts toward us; none can compare with thee! Were I to proclaim and tell of them, they would be more than can be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire; but thou hast given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering thou hast not required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I said, "Lo, I come; in the roll of the book it is written of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is within my heart."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; lo, I have not restrained my lips, as thou knowest, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have not hid thy saving help within my heart, I have spoken of thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness from the great congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Do not thou, O LORD, withhold thy mercy from me, let thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness ever preserve me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For evils have encompassed me without number; my iniquities have overtaken me, till I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be put to shame and confusion altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let them be appalled because of their shame who say to me, "Aha, Aha!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But may all who seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; may those who love thy salvation say continually, "Great is the LORD!" [ (Psalms 40:18) As for me, I am poor and needy; but the Lord takes thought for me. Thou art my help and my deliverer; do not tarry, O my God! ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
