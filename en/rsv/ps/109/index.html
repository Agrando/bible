A Psalm of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Be not silent, O God of my praise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They beset me with words of hate, and attack me without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In return for my love they accuse me, even as I make prayer for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they reward me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Appoint a wicked man against him; let an accuser bring him to trial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When he is tried, let him come forth guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>May his days be few; may another seize his goods!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>May his children wander about and beg; may they be driven out of the ruins they inhabit!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor any to pity his fatherless children!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>May his posterity be cut off; may his name be blotted out in the second generation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let them be before the LORD continually; and may his memory be cut off from the earth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted to their death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He loved to curse; let curses come on him! He did not like blessing; may it be far from him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He clothed himself with cursing as his coat, may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>May it be like a garment which he wraps round him, like a belt with which he daily girds himself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>May this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, of those who speak evil against my life!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But thou, O GOD my Lord, deal on my behalf for thy name's sake; because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I am poor and needy, and my heart is stricken within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I am gone, like a shadow at evening; I am shaken off like a locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>My knees are weak through fasting; my body has become gaunt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they wag their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Help me, O LORD my God! Save me according to thy steadfast love!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them know that this is thy hand; thou, O LORD, hast done it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let them curse, but do thou bless! Let my assailants be put to shame; may thy servant be glad!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>May my accusers be clothed with dishonor; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a mantle!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>With my mouth I will give great thanks to the LORD; I will praise him in the midst of the throng. [ (Psalms 109:32) For he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who condemn him to death. ]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
