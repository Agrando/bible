Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear by thine own self, and didst say to them, `I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it for ever.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turned, and went down from the mountain with the two tables of the testimony in his hands, tables that were written on both sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a noise of war in the camp."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he said, "It is not the sound of shouting for victory, or the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the people of Israel drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon them?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron said, "Let not the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are set on evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they said to me, `Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I said to them, `Let any who have gold take it off'; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and there came out this calf."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, to their shame among their enemies),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Who is on the LORD's side? Come to me." And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, `Put every man his sword on his side, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, "Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the LORD, each one at the cost of his son and of his brother, that he may bestow a blessing upon you this day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>On the morrow Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Alas, this people have sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD sent a plague upon the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
