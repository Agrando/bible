So now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do with you.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; and he called it the tent of meeting. And every one who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose up, and every man stood at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the door of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, every man at his tent door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moses said to the LORD, "See, thou sayest to me, `Bring up this people'; but thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, `I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee and find favor in thy sight. Consider too that this nation is thy people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to him, "If thy presence will not go with me, do not carry us up from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? Is it not in thy going with us, so that we are distinct, I and thy people, from all other people that are upon the face of the earth?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "This very thing that you have spoken I will do; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moses said, "I pray thee, show me thy glory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you my name `The LORD'; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But," he said, "you cannot see my face; for man shall not see me and live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand upon the rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
