Let my people go, that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land; and they shall eat what is left to you after the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours which grows in the field,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.'" Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God; do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh; and he said to them, "Go, serve the LORD your God; but who are to go?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said, "We will go with our young and our old; we will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, "The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No! Go, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you desire." And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning the east wind had brought the locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt, and settled on the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever shall be again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste, and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore, forgive my sin, I pray you, only this once, and entreat the LORD your God only to remove this death from me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD turned a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be felt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>they did not see one another, nor did any rise from his place for three days; but all the people of Israel had light where they dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Pharaoh called Moses, and said, "Go, serve the LORD; your children also may go with you; only let your flocks and your herds remain behind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Moses said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our cattle also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we must take of them to serve the LORD our God, and we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me; take heed to yourself; never see my face again; for in the day you see my face you shall die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moses said, "As you say! I will not see your face again."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
