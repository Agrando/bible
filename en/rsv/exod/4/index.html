He said, "A rod."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said, "Cast it on the ground." So he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the LORD said to Moses, "Put out your hand, and take it by the tail"-- so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Again, the LORD said to him, "Put your hand into your bosom." And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then God said, "Put your hand back into your bosom." So he put his hand back into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"If they will not believe you," God said, "or heed the first sign, they may believe the latter sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If they will not believe even these two signs or heed your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it upon the dry ground; and the water which you shall take from the Nile will become blood upon the dry ground."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Moses said to the LORD, "Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either heretofore or since thou hast spoken to thy servant; but I am slow of speech and of tongue."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the LORD said to him, "Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said, "Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, "Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well; and behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall speak for you to the people; and he shall be a mouth for you, and you shall be to him as God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall take in your hand this rod, with which you shall do the signs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go back, I pray, to my kinsmen in Egypt and see whether they are still alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD said to Moses in Mid'ian, "Go back to Egypt; for all the men who were seeking your life are dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Moses took his wife and his sons and set them on an ass, and went back to the land of Egypt; and in his hand Moses took the rod of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall say to Pharaoh, `Thus says the LORD, Israel is my first-born son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and I say to you, "Let my son go that he may serve me"; if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your first-born son.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>At a lodging place on the way the LORD met him and sought to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Zippo'rah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin, and touched Moses' feet with it, and said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he let him alone. Then it was that she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood," because of the circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he went, and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him, and all the signs which he had charged him to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
