And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and took six hundred picked chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued the people of Israel as they went forth defiantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamped at the sea, by Pi-ha-hi'roth, in front of Ba'al-ze'phon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were in great fear. And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they said to Moses, "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us, in bringing us out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not this what we said to you in Egypt, `Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to the people, "Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be still."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The LORD said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go on dry ground through the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the angel of God who went before the host of Israel moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness; and the night passed without one coming near the other all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down upon the host of the Egyptians, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily; and the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from before Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its wonted flow when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled into it, and the LORD routed the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not so much as one of them remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw the great work which the LORD did against the Egyptians, and the people feared the LORD; and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
