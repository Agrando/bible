These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do." And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "Lo, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you for ever."  Then Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and be ready by the third day; for on the third day the LORD will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall set bounds for the people round about, saying, `Take heed that you do not go up into the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>no hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to the people, "Be ready by the third day; do not go near a woman."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God; and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze and many of them perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out upon them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for thou thyself didst charge us, saying, `Set bounds about the mountain, and consecrate it.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD said to him, "Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down to the people and told them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
