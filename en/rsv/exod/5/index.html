I do not know the LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us; let us go, we pray, a three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get to your burdens."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many and you make them rest from their burdens!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the number of bricks which they made heretofore you shall lay upon them, you shall by no means lessen it; for they are idle; therefore they cry, `Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let heavier work be laid upon the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, "Thus says Pharaoh, `I will not give you straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go yourselves, get your straw wherever you can find it; but your work will not be lessened in the least.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The taskmasters were urgent, saying, "Complete your work, your daily task, as when there was straw."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, "Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today, as hitherto?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, "Why do you deal thus with your servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, `Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said, "You are idle, you are idle; therefore you say, `Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Go now, and work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in evil plight, when they said, "You shall by no means lessen your daily number of bricks."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came forth from Pharaoh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they said to them, "The LORD look upon you and judge, because you have made us offensive in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Moses turned again to the LORD and said, "O LORD, why hast thou done evil to this people? Why didst thou ever send me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has done evil to this people, and thou hast not delivered thy people at all."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
