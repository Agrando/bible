They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that all the able men who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said to Moses, "The people bring much more than enough for doing the work which the LORD has commanded us to do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, "Let neither man nor woman do anything more for the offering for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for the stuff they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the able men among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains; they were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet stuff, with cherubim skilfully worked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he made loops of blue on the edge of the outmost curtain of the first set; likewise he made them on the edge of the outmost curtain of the second set;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>he made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps; so the tabernacle was one whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains had the same measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outmost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be one whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Each frame had two tenons, for fitting together; he did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The frames for the tabernacle he made thus: twenty frames for the south side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under one frame for its two tenons, and two bases under another frame for its two tenons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one frame and two bases under another frame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And for the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they were separate beneath, but joined at the top, at the first ring; he made two of them thus, for the two corners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he made the middle bar to pass through from end to end halfway up the frames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen; with cherubim skilfully worked he made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And for it he made four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He also made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen, embroidered with needlework;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and its five pillars with their hooks.
