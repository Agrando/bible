and you shall bring in the lampstand, and set up its lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the screen for the door of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and place the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall set up the court round about, and hang up the screen for the gate of the court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and consecrate it and all its furniture; and it shall become holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall also anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar; and the altar shall be most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall also anoint the laver and its base, and consecrate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and put upon Aaron the holy garments, and you shall anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve me as priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall bring his sons also and put coats on them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may serve me as priests: and their anointing shall admit them to a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus did Moses; according to all that the LORD commanded him, so he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was erected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moses erected the tabernacle; he laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the testimony and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the ark, and set the mercy seat above on the ark;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and set the bread in order on it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and set up the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and burnt fragrant incense upon it; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he put in place the screen for the door of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the cereal offering; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he erected the court round the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would go onward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not go onward till the day that it was taken up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For throughout all their journeys the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
