Moses said, "Be it as you say, that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The frogs shall depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they shall be left only in the Nile."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried to the LORD concerning the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; the frogs died out of the houses and courtyards and out of the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and would not listen to them; as the LORD had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, `Stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there came gnats on man and beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The magicians tried by their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the LORD had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and wait for Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, `Thus says the LORD, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there; that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus I will put a division between my people and your people. By tomorrow shall this sign be."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the LORD did so; there came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses, and in all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by reason of the flies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God within the land."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Moses said, "It would not be right to do so; for we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God offerings abominable to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We must go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he will command us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Make entreaty for me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Moses said, "Behold, I am going out from you and I will pray to the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal falsely again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
