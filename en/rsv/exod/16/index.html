For what are we, that you murmur against us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said, "When the LORD gives you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the LORD has heard your murmurings which you murmur against him--what are we? Your murmurings are not against us but against the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said to Aaron, "Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, `Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your murmurings.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"I have heard the murmurings of the people of Israel; say to them, `At twilight you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning dew lay round about the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as hoarfrost on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, "It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is what the LORD has commanded: `Gather of it, every man of you, as much as he can eat; you shall take an omer apiece, according to the number of the persons whom each of you has in his tent.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the people of Israel did so; they gathered, some more, some less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; each gathered according to what he could eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said to them, "Let no man leave any of it till the morning."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they did not listen to Moses; some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers apiece; and when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>he said to them, "This is what the LORD has commanded: `Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay by to be kept till the morning.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they laid it by till the morning, as Moses bade them; and it did not become foul, and there were no worms in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a sabbath, there will be none."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See! The LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days; remain every man of you in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the house of Israel called its name manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: `Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD, to be kept throughout your generations."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony, to be kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land; they ate the manna, till they came to the border of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
