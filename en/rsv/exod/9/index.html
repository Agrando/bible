But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of ashes from the kiln, and let Moses throw them toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they took ashes from the kiln, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses threw them toward heaven, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, `Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this time I will send all my plagues upon your heart, and upon your servants and your people, that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For by now I could have put forth my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but for this purpose have I let you live, to show you my power, so that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You are still exalting yourself against my people, and will not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore send, get your cattle and all that you have in the field into safe shelter; for the hail shall come down upon every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home, and they shall die."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he who feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his slaves and his cattle flee into the houses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but he who did not regard the word of the LORD left his slaves and his cattle in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man and beast and every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The hail struck down everything that was in the field throughout all the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and the hail struck down every plant of the field, and shattered every tree of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, there was no hail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Pharaoh sent, and called Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time; the LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Entreat the LORD; for there has been enough of this thunder and hail; I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, that you may know that the earth is the LORD's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>(The flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they are late in coming up.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and stretched out his hands to the LORD; and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken through Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
