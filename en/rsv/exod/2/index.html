She took pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." So the girl went and called the child's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son; and she named him Moses, for she said, "Because I drew him out of the water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together; and he said to the man that did the wrong, "Why do you strike your fellow?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He answered, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid, and thought, "Surely the thing is known."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses.  But Moses fled from Pharaoh, and stayed in the land of Mid'ian; and he sat down by a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the priest of Mid'ian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they came to their father Reu'el, he said, "How is it that you have come so soon today?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and even drew water for us and watered the flock."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to his daughters, "And where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zippo'rah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>She bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the course of those many days the king of Egypt died. And the people of Israel groaned under their bondage, and cried out for help, and their cry under bondage came up to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And God saw the people of Israel, and God knew their condition.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
