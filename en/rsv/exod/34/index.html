Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth or in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD; for it is a terrible thing that I will do with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Per'izzites, the Hivites, and the Jeb'usites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither you go, lest it become a snare in the midst of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall tear down their altars, and break their pillars, and cut down their Ashe'rim</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(for you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and when they play the harlot after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and one invites you, you eat of his sacrifice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and you take of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods and make your sons play the harlot after their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"You shall make for yourself no molten gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"The feast of unleavened bread you shall keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All that opens the womb is mine, all your male cattle, the firstlings of cow and sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the first-born of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall observe the feast of weeks, the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land, when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The first of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the people of Israel what he was commanded,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the people of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone; and Moses would put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
