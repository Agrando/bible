Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand about you from morning till evening?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God and his decisions."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moses' father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You and the people with you will wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God, and bring their cases to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and you shall teach them the statutes and the decisions, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moreover choose able men from all the people, such as fear God, men who are trustworthy and who hate a bribe; and place such men over the people as rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them judge the people at all times; every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves; so it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you do this, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Moses gave heed to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they judged the people at all times; hard cases they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own country.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
