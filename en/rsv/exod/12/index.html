It is the LORD's passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The blood shall be a sign for you, upon the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall fall upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as an ordinance for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses, for if any one eats what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly; no work shall be done on those days; but what every one must eat, that only may be prepared by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as an ordinance for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, and so until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for if any one eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said to them, "Select lambs for yourselves according to your families, and kill the passover lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood which is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the LORD will pass through to slay the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to slay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You shall observe this rite as an ordinance for you and for your sons for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when you come to the land which the LORD will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when your children say to you, `What do you mean by this service?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>you shall say, `It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he slew the Egyptians but spared our houses.'" And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then the people of Israel went and did so; as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At midnight the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the first-born of the cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where one was not dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he summoned Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up, go forth from among my people, both you and the people of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, "We are all dead men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their mantles on their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them, for they had asked of the Egyptians jewelry of silver and of gold, and clothing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. Thus they despoiled the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the people of Israel journeyed from Ram'eses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very many cattle, both flocks and herds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The time that the people of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, on that very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It was a night of watching by the LORD, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; so this same night is a night of watching kept to the LORD by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the passover: no foreigner shall eat of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>No sojourner or hired servant may eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth any of the flesh outside the house; and you shall not break a bone of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, then he may come near and keep it; he shall be as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Thus did all the people of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And on that very day the LORD brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
