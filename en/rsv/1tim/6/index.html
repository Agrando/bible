Teach and urge these duties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is puffed up with conceit, he knows nothing; he has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, base suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and wrangling among men who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is great gain in godliness with contentment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is the root of all evils; it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced their hearts with many pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But as for you, man of God, shun all this; aim at righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the presence of God who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I charge you to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and this will be made manifest at the proper time by the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches but on God who richly furnishes us with everything to enjoy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They are to do good, to be rich in good deeds, liberal and generous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>thus laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life which is life indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the godless chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith.  Grace be with you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
