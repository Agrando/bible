and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands round about the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The cities shall be theirs to dwell in, and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their livestock and for all their beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The pasture lands of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall measure, outside the city, for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the middle; this shall belong to them as pasture land for their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The cities which you give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, where you shall permit the manslayer to flee, and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the cities which you give to the Levites shall be forty-eight, with their pasture lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And as for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the people of Israel, from the larger tribes you shall take many, and from the smaller tribes you shall take few; each, in proportion to the inheritance which it inherits, shall give of its cities to the Levites."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Say to the people of Israel, When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then you shall select cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person without intent may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the cities which you give shall be your six cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities in the land of Canaan, to be cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>These six cities shall be for refuge for the people of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, that any one who kills any person without intent may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"But if he struck him down with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he struck him down with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Or if he struck him down with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if he stabbed him from hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>or in enmity struck him down with his hand, so that he died, then he who struck the blow shall be put to death; he is a murderer; the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"But if he stabbed him suddenly without enmity, or hurled anything on him without lying in wait,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>or used a stone, by which a man may die, and without seeing him cast it upon him, so that he died, though he was not his enemy, and did not seek his harm;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood, in accordance with these ordinances;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the congregation shall rescue the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, to which he had fled, and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the bounds of his city of refuge to which he fled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the avenger of blood finds him outside the bounds of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slays the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the man must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"And these things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If any one kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death on the evidence of witnesses; but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Moreover you shall accept no ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death; but he shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall accept no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You shall not thus pollute the land in which you live; for blood pollutes the land, and no expiation can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of him who shed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the LORD dwell in the midst of the people of Israel."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
