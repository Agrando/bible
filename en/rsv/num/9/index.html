according to all its statutes and all its ordinances you shall keep it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there were certain men who were unclean through touching the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and those men said to him, "We are unclean through touching the dead body of a man; why are we kept from offering the LORD's offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said to them, "Wait, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Say to the people of Israel, If any man of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is afar off on a journey, he shall still keep the passover to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the second month on the fourteenth day in the evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute for the passover they shall keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, yet refrains from keeping the passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not offer the LORD's offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a stranger sojourns among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the passover and according to its ordinance, so shall he do; you shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony; and at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it was continually; the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel encamped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the command of the LORD the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the LORD they encamped; as long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and did not set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp; then according to the command of the LORD they set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud was taken up they set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out; but when it was taken up they set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the command of the LORD they encamped, and at the command of the LORD they set out; they kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
