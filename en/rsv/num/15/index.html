all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the congregation brought him outside the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"Speak to the people of Israel, and bid them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put upon the tassel of each corner a cord of blue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and it shall be to you a tassel to look upon and remember all the commandments of the LORD, to do them, not to follow after your own heart and your own eyes, which you are inclined to go after wantonly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So you shall remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
