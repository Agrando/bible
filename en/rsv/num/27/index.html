The names of his daughters were: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they stood before Moses, and before Elea'zar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Our father died in the wilderness; he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah, but died for his own sin; and he had no sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why should the name of our father be taken away from his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father's brethren."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moses brought their case before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"The daughters of Zeloph'ehad are right; you shall give them possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall say to the people of Israel, `If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be to the people of Israel a statute and ordinance, as the LORD commanded Moses.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The LORD said to Moses, "Go up into this mountain of Ab'arim, and see the land which I have given to the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was gathered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin during the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes."
