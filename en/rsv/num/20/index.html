It is no place for grain, or figs, or vines, or pomegranates; and there is no water to drink."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the LORD said to Moses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water; so you shall bring water out of the rock for them; so you shall give drink to the congregation and their cattle."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These are the waters of Mer'ibah, where the people of Israel contended with the LORD, and he showed himself holy among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, "Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the adversity that has befallen us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel and brought us forth out of Egypt; and here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, neither will we drink water from a well; we will go along the King's Highway, we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, until we have passed through your territory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword against you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the people of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my cattle, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, nothing more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against them with many men, and with a strong force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the people of Israel, because you rebelled against my command at the waters of Mer'ibah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Take Aaron and Elea'zar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Elea'zar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Moses did as the LORD commanded; and they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Elea'zar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Elea'zar came down from the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
