And the Spirit of God came upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he took up his discourse, and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Be'or, the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>the oracle of him who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>how fair are your tents, O Jacob, your encampments, O Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Like valleys that stretch afar, like gardens beside a river, like aloes that the LORD has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>God brings him out of Egypt; he has as it were the horns of the wild ox, he shall eat up the nations his adversaries, and shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them through with his arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He couched, he lay down like a lion, and like a lioness; who will rouse him up? Blessed be every one who blesses you, and cursed be every one who curses you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore now flee to your place; I said, `I will certainly honor you,' but the LORD has held you back from honor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own will; what the LORD speaks, that will I speak'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now, behold, I am going to my people; come, I will let you know what this people will do to your people in the latter days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he took up his discourse, and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Be'or, the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the oracle of him who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh: a star shall come forth out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the forehead of Moab, and break down all the sons of Sheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Edom shall be dispossessed, Se'ir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed, while Israel does valiantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By Jacob shall dominion be exercised, and the survivors of cities be destroyed!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he looked on Am'alek, and took up his discourse, and said, "Am'alek was the first of the nations, but in the end he shall come to destruction."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he looked on the Ken'ite, and took up his discourse, and said, "Enduring is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>nevertheless Kain shall be wasted. How long shall Asshur take you away captive?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took up his discourse, and said, "Alas, who shall live when God does this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But ships shall come from Kittim and shall afflict Asshur and Eber; and he also shall come to destruction."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Balaam rose, and went back to his place; and Balak also went his way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
