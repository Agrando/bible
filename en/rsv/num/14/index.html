Or would that we had died in this wilderness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Why does the LORD bring us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become a prey; would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said to one another, "Let us choose a captain, and go back to Egypt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephun'neh, who were among those who had spied out the land, rent their clothes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, "The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the LORD delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Only, do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us; their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But all the congregation said to stone them with stones.  Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD said to Moses, "How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs which I have wrought among them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for thou didst bring up this people in thy might from among them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou, O LORD, art in the midst of this people; for thou, O LORD, art seen face to face, and thy cloud stands over them and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if thou dost kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard thy fame will say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to give to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, I pray thee, let the power of the LORD be great as thou hast promised, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`The LORD is slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of fathers upon children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray thee, according to the greatness of thy steadfast love, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the LORD said, "I have pardoned, according to your word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the proof these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>shall see the land which I swore to give to their fathers; and none of those who despised me shall see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, since the Amal'ekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"How long shall this wicked congregation murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the people of Israel, which they murmur against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say to them, `As I live,' says the LORD, `what you have said in my hearing I will do to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and of all your number, numbered from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>not one shall come into the land where I swore that I would make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephun'neh and Joshua the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But your little ones, who you said would become a prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land which you have despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and shall suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day a year, you shall bear your iniquity, forty years, and you shall know my displeasure.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I, the LORD, have spoken; surely this will I do to all this wicked congregation that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall come to a full end, and there they shall die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>the men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by plague before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephun'neh remained alive, of those men who went to spy out the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Moses told these words to all the people of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they rose early in the morning, and went up to the heights of the hill country, saying, "See, we are here, we will go up to the place which the LORD has promised; for we have sinned."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But Moses said, "Why now are you transgressing the command of the LORD, for that will not succeed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Do not go up lest you be struck down before your enemies, for the LORD is not among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For there the Amal'ekites and the Canaanites are before you, and you shall fall by the sword; because you have turned back from following the LORD, the LORD will not be with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But they presumed to go up to the heights of the hill country, although neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD, nor Moses, departed out of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the Amal'ekites and the Canaanites who dwelt in that hill country came down, and defeated them and pursued them, even to Hormah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
