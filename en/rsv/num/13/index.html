And Moses called Hoshe'a the son of Nun Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, "Go up into the Negeb yonder, and go up into the hill country,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there is wood in it or not. Be of good courage, and bring some of the fruit of the land." Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They went up into the Negeb, and came to Hebron; and Ahi'man, She'shai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zo'an in Egypt.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they brought also some pomegranates and figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the men of Israel cut down from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they told him, "We came to the land to which you sent us; it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Amal'ekites dwell in the land of the Negeb; the Hittites, the Jeb'usites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, "Let us go up at once, and occupy it; for we are well able to overcome it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they brought to the people of Israel an evil report of the land which they had spied out, saying, "The land, through which we have gone, to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim); and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
