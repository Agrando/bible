The holy stones lie scattered at the head of every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold, how they are reckoned as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even the jackals give the breast and suckle their young, but the daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The tongue of the nursling cleaves to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children beg for food, but no one gives to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those who feasted on dainties perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple lie on ash heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, no hand being laid on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, the beauty of their form was like sapphire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now their visage is blacker than soot, they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled upon their bones, it has become as dry as wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Happier were the victims of the sword than the victims of hunger, who pined away, stricken by want of the fruits of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The LORD gave full vent to his wrath, he poured out his hot anger; and he kindled a fire in Zion, which consumed its foundations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The kings of the earth did not believe, or any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed in the midst of her the blood of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They wandered, blind, through the streets, so defiled with blood that none could touch their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Away! Unclean!" men cried at them; "Away! Away! Touch not!" So they became fugitives and wanderers; men said among the nations, "They shall stay with us no longer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The LORD himself has scattered them, he will regard them no more; no honor was shown to the priests, no favor to the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; in our watching we watched for a nation which could not save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Men dogged our steps so that we could not walk in our streets; our end drew near; our days were numbered; for our end had come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Our pursuers were swifter than the vultures in the heavens; they chased us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The breath of our nostrils, the LORD's anointed, was taken in their pits, he of whom we said, "Under his shadow we shall live among the nations."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, dweller in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup shall pass; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished, he will keep you in exile no longer; but your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish, he will uncover your sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
