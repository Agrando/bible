Behold, three more kings shall arise in Persia; and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them; and when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Then the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his princes shall be stronger than he and his dominion shall be a great dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make peace; but she shall not retain the strength of her arm, and he and his offspring shall not endure; but she shall be given up, and her attendants, her child, and he who got possession of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"In those times a branch from her roots shall arise in his place; he shall come against the army and enter the fortress of the king of the north, and he shall deal with them and shall prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their molten images and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and for some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the latter shall come into the realm of the king of the south but shall return into his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on and overflow and pass through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the king of the south, moved with anger, shall come out and fight with the king of the north; and he shall raise a great multitude, but it shall be given into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the multitude is taken, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the former; and after some years he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"In those times many shall rise against the king of the south; and the men of violence among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfil the vision; but they shall fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the king of the north shall come and throw up siegeworks, and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, or even his picked troops, for there shall be no strength to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and all of it shall be in his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of peace and perform them. He shall give him the daughter of women to destroy the kingdom; but it shall not stand or be to his advantage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Afterward he shall turn his face to the coastlands, and shall take many of them; but a commander shall put an end to his insolence; indeed he shall turn his insolence back upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he shall turn his face back toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an exactor of tribute through the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he shall be broken, neither in anger nor in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In his place shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given; he shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Armies shall be utterly swept away before him and broken, and the prince of the covenant also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall act deceitfully; and he shall become strong with a small people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Without warning he shall come into the richest parts of the province; and he shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers' fathers have done, scattering among them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds, but only for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for plots shall be devised against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even those who eat his rich food shall be his undoing; his army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as for the two kings, their minds shall be bent on mischief; they shall speak lies at the same table, but to no avail; for the end is yet to be at the time appointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he shall return to his land with great substance, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. And he shall work his will, and return to his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south; but it shall not be this time as it was before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be afraid and withdraw, and shall turn back and be enraged and take action against the holy covenant. He shall turn back and give heed to those who forsake the holy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Forces from him shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt offering. And they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He shall seduce with flattery those who violate the covenant; but the people who know their God shall stand firm and take action.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those among the people who are wise shall make many understand, though they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and plunder, for some days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When they fall, they shall receive a little help. And many shall join themselves to them with flattery;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and some of those who are wise shall fall, to refine and to cleanse them and to make them white, until the time of the end, for it is yet for the time appointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"And the king shall do according to his will; he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods. He shall prosper till the indignation is accomplished; for what is determined shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He shall give no heed to the gods of his fathers, or to the one beloved by women; he shall not give heed to any other god, for he shall magnify himself above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He shall honor the god of fortresses instead of these; a god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god; those who acknowledge him he shall magnify with honor. He shall make them rulers over many and shall divide the land for a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"At the time of the end the king of the south shall attack him; but the king of the north shall rush upon him like a whirlwind, with chariots and horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall come into countries and shall overflow and pass through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He shall come into the glorious land. And tens of thousands shall fall, but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He shall become ruler of the treasures of gold and of silver, and all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall follow in his train.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But tidings from the east and the north shall alarm him, and he shall go forth with great fury to exterminate and utterly destroy many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, with none to help him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
