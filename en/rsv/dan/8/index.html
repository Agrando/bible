It had two horns; and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward; no beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power; he did as he pleased and magnified himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the river, and he ran at him in his mighty wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns; and the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled upon him; and there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It magnified itself, even up to the Prince of the host; and the continual burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression; and truth was cast down to the ground, and the horn acted and prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the one that spoke, "For how long is the vision concerning the continual burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled under foot?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to him, "For two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the U'lai, and it called, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened and fell upon my face. But he said to me, "Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and set me on my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said, "Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation; for it pertains to the appointed time of the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for the ram which you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the he-goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And at the latter end of their rule, when the transgressors have reached their full measure, a king of bold countenance, one who understands riddles, shall arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His power shall be great, and he shall cause fearful destruction, and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall magnify himself. Without warning he shall destroy many; and he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes; but, by no human hand, he shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The vision of the evenings and the mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it pertains to many days hence."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days; then I rose and went about the king's business; but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
