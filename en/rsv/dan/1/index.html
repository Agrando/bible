They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Among these were Daniel, Hanani'ah, Mish'a-el, and Azari'ah of the tribe of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshaz'zar, Hanani'ah he called Shadrach, Mish'a-el he called Meshach, and Azari'ah he called Abed'nego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's rich food, or with the wine which he drank; therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, "I fear lest my lord the king, who appointed your food and your drink, should see that you were in poorer condition than the youths who are of your own age. So you would endanger my head with the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hanani'ah, Mish'a-el, and Azari'ah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's rich food be observed by you, and according to what you see deal with your servants."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he hearkened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king's rich food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the steward took away their rich food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all letters and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnez'zar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the king spoke with them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hanani'ah, Mish'a-el, and Azari'ah; therefore they stood before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
