Then he wrote down the dream, and told the sum of the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Daniel said, "I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand upon two feet like a man; and the mind of a man was given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side; it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, `Arise, devour much flesh.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After this I looked, and lo, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion was given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrible and dreadful and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As I looked, thrones were placed and one that was ancient of days took his seat; his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, its wheels were burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I looked then because of the sound of the great words which the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And to him was given dominion and glory and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious and the visions of my head alarmed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made known to me the interpretation of the things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, for ever and ever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrible, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze; and which devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up and before which three of them fell, the horn which had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and which seemed greater than its fellows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As I looked, this horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints received the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Thus he said: `As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, two times, and half a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed; but I kept the matter in my mind."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
