Did you not sign an interdict, that any man who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?" The king answered, "The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they answered before the king, "That Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no heed to you, O king, or the interdict you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed, and set his mind to deliver Daniel; and he labored till the sun went down to rescue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then these men came by agreement to the king, and said to the king, "Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no interdict or ordinance which the king establishes can be changed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king went to his palace, and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish and said to Daniel, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Daniel said to the king, "O king, live for ever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king commanded, and those men who had accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions--they, their children, and their wives; and before they reached the bottom of the den the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: "Peace be multiplied to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, enduring for ever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He delivers and rescues, he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
