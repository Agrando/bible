He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then King Nebuchadnez'zar sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnez'zar had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, were assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnez'zar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnez'zar had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the herald proclaimed aloud, "You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnez'zar has set up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image which King Nebuchadnez'zar had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore at that time certain Chalde'ans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They said to King Nebuchadnez'zar, "O king, live for ever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego. These men, O king, pay no heed to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Nebuchadnez'zar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego be brought. Then they brought these men before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nebuchadnez'zar said to them, "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego answered the king, "O Nebuchadnez'zar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Nebuchadnez'zar was full of fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he ordered certain mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then these men were bound in their mantles, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were cast into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because the king's order was strict and the furnace very hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then King Nebuchadnez'zar was astonished and rose up in haste. He said to his counselors, "Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?" They answered the king, "True, O king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered, "But I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Nebuchadnez'zar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace and said, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego, servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego came out from the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their mantles were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nebuchadnez'zar said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set at nought the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
