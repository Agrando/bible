When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>having become as much superior to angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For to what angel did God ever say,  "Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee"? Or again,  "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And again, when he brings the first-born into the world, he says,  "Let all God's angels worship him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the angels he says,  "Who makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But of the Son he says,  "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, the righteous scepter is the scepter of thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy comrades."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And,  "Thou, Lord, didst found the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of thy hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>they will perish, but thou remainest; they will all grow old like a garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>like a mantle thou wilt roll them up, and they will be changed. But thou art the same, and thy years will never end."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But to what angel has he ever said,  "Sit at my right hand, till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to serve, for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
