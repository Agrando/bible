And we are his house if we hold fast our confidence and pride in our hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, when you hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, `They always go astray in their hearts; they have not known my ways.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As I swore in my wrath, `They shall never enter my rest.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Take care, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today," that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we share in Christ, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>while it is said, "Today, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were they that heard and yet were rebellious? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And with whom was he provoked forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to whom did he swear that they should never enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
