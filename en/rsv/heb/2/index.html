It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It has been testified somewhere, "What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man, that thou carest for him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou didst make him for a little while lower than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>putting everything in subjection under his feet." Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have all one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, "I will proclaim thy name to my brethren, in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
