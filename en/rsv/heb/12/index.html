God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Besides this, we have had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they disciplined us for a short time at their pleasure, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See to it that no one fail to obtain the grace of God; that no "root of bitterness" spring up and cause trouble, and by it the many become defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that no one be immoral or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers entreat that no further messages be spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they could not endure the order that was given, "If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, "I tremble with fear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and to the assembly of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to a judge who is God of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks more graciously than the blood of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less shall we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>His voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This phrase, "Yet once more," indicates the removal of what is shaken, as of what has been made, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
