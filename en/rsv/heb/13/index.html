Let them do this joyfully, and not sadly, for that would be of no advantage to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever.
