Is it not your passions that are at war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You desire and do not have; so you kill. And you covet and cannot obtain; so you fight and wage war. You do not have, because you do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Unfaithful creatures! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you suppose it is in vain that the scripture says, "He yearns jealously over the spirit which he has made to dwell in us"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives more grace; therefore it says, "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you men of double mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to dejection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not speak evil against one another, brethren. He that speaks evil against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you that you judge your neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and get gain";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whereas you do not know about tomorrow. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and we shall do this or that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Whoever knows what is right to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
