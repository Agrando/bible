You have laid up treasure for the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned, you have killed the righteous man; he does not resist you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it until it receives the early and the late rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not grumble, brethren, against one another, that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As an example of suffering and patience, brethren, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, we call those happy who were steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no be no, that you may not fall under condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any one among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Eli'jah was a man of like nature with ourselves and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My brethren, if any one among you wanders from the truth and some one brings him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
