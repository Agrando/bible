So will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Every good endowment and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Know this, my beloved brethren. Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore put away all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who observes his natural face in a mirror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for he observes himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer that forgets but a doer that acts, he shall be blessed in his doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If any one thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this man's religion is vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
