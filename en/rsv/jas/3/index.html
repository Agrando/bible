How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is an unrighteous world among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the cycle of nature, and set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by humankind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but no human being can tame the tongue--a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brethren, this ought not to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a spring pour forth from the same opening fresh water and brackish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good life let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not such as comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty or insincerity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
