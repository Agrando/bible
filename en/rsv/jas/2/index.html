Has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you, is it not they who drag you into court?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is it not they who blaspheme that honorable name which was invoked over you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you really fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," said also, "Do not kill." If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy; yet mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things needed for the body, what does it profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But some one will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe--and shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do you want to be shown, you shallow man, that faith apart from works is barren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness"; and he was called the friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the same way was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
