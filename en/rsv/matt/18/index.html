For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Peter came up and said to him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he began the reckoning, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, `Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And out of pity for him the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But that same servant, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat he said, `Pay what you owe.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So his fellow servant fell down and besought him, `Have patience with me, and I will pay you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then his lord summoned him and said to him, `You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you besought me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in anger his lord delivered him to the jailers, till he should pay all his debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
