So also the Son of man will suffer at their hands."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling before him said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured instantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them, "Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, `Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day." And they were greatly distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they came to Caper'na-um, the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said, "Does not your teacher pay the tax?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said, "Yes." And when he came home, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he said, "From others," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for me and for yourself."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
