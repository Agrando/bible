But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As he went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a lonely place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said, "They need not go away; you give them something to eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They said to him, "We have only five loaves here and two fish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, "Bring them here to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But immediately he spoke to them, saying, "Take heart, it is I; have no fear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, "O man of little faith, why did you doubt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent round to all that region and brought to him all that were sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
