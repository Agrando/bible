Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us this day our daily bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"And when you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but if your eye is not sound, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we drink?' or `What shall we wear?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day's own trouble be sufficient for the day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
