and the whole crowd stood on the beach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he told them many things in parables, saying: "A sower went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they had not much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but when the sun rose they were scorched; and since they had no root they withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Other seeds fell upon thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who has ears, let him hear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For to him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: `You shall indeed hear but never understand, and you shall indeed see but never perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this people's heart has grown dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should perceive with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Hear then the parable of the sower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As for what was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the delight in riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As for what was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit, and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable he put before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the servants of the householder came and said to him, `Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them, `An enemy has done this.' The servants said to him, `Then do you want us to go and gather them?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, `No; lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable he put before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All this Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed he said nothing to them without a parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the field is the world, and the good seed means the sons of the kingdom; the weeds are the sons of the evil one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>when it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"Have you understood all this?" They said to him, "Yes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
