And they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?" so that they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to them, "What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, whole like the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him, how to destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and ordered them not to make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim justice to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will any one hear his voice in the streets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick, till he brings justice to victory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and in his name will the Gentiles hope."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then a blind and dumb demoniac was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the people were amazed, and said, "Can this be the Son of David?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the Pharisees heard it they said, "It is only by Be-el'zebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I cast out demons by Be-el'zebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or how can one enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You brood of vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I tell you, on the day of judgment men will render account for every careless word they utter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Nin'eveh will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the South will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest, but he finds none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he says, `I will return to my house from which I came.' And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But he replied to the man who told him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
