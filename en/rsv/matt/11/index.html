A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why then did you go out? To see a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those who wear soft raiment are in kings' houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Why then did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is he of whom it is written, `Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if you are willing to accept it, he is Eli'jah who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places and calling to their playmates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`We piped to you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not mourn.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, `He has a demon';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, `Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to upbraid the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Woe to you, Chora'zin! woe to you, Beth-sa'ida! for if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I tell you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Caper'na-um, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus declared, "I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>yea, Father, for such was thy gracious will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
