You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah." So he left them and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sad'ducees."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they discussed it among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Jesus, aware of this, said, "O men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How is it that you fail to perceive that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sad'ducees."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sad'ducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesare'a Philip'pi, he asked his disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of man is?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Eli'jah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, "God forbid, Lord! This shall never happen to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you are not on the side of God, but of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus told his disciples, "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay every man for what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
