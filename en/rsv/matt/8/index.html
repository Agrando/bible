And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus said to him, "See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As he entered Caper'na-um, a centurion came forward to him, beseeching him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to him, "I will come and heal him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the centurion answered him, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, `Go,' and he goes, and to another, `Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, `Do this,' and he does it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And to the centurion Jesus said, "Go; be it done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed at that very moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they went and woke him, saying, "Save, Lord; we are perishing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to them, "Why are you afraid, O men of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the men marveled, saying, "What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demoniacs met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the demons begged him, "If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their neighborhood.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
