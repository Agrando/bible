Come, see the place where he lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Lo, I have told you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Hail!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sum of money to the soldiers</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said, "Tell people, `His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were directed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
