You received without paying, give without pay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>no bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the laborer deserves his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it, and stay with him until you depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As you enter the house, salute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomor'rah than for that town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils, and flog you in their synagogues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they deliver you up, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel, before the Son of man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Be-el'zebul, how much more will they malign those of his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim upon the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So every one who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and a man's foes will be those of his own household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
