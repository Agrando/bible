Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bear fruit that befits repentance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and do not presume to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>John would have prevented him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness." Then he consented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
