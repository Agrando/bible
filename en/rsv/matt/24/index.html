Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered them, "Take heed that no one leads you astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in my name, saying, `I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>all this is but the beginning of the birth-pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you to death; and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And then many will fall away, and betray one another, and hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because wickedness is multiplied, most men's love will grow cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who endures to the end will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"So when you see the desolating sacrilege spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>let him who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if those days had not been shortened, no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if any one says to you, `Lo, here is the Christ!' or `There he is!' do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Lo, I have told you beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So, if they say to you, `Lo, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out; if they say, `Lo, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But know this, that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that wicked servant says to himself, `My master is delayed,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eats and drinks with the drunken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and will punish him, and put him with the hypocrites; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
