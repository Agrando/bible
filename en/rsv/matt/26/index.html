For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said, "What will you give me if I deliver him to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the passover?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, "Go into the city to a certain one, and say to him, `The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When it was evening, he sat at table with the twelve disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and as they were eating, he said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, "Is it I, Lord?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He answered, "He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me, will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Judas, who betrayed him, said, "Is it I, Master?" He said to him, "You have said so."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, "Drink of it, all of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, `I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter declared to him, "Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, "Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you." And so said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsem'ane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go yonder and pray."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zeb'edee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he came up to Jesus at once and said, "Hail, Master!" And he kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Ca'iaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, "This fellow said, `I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest stood up and said, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his robes, and said, "He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What is your judgment?" They answered, "He deserves death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spat in his face, and struck him; and some slapped him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him, and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man." And immediately the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
