Come out to meet him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the foolish said to the wise, `Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise replied, `Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterward the other maidens came also, saying, `Lord, lord, open to us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he replied, `Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"For it will be as when a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his property;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So also, he who had the two talents made two talents more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, `Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His master said to him, `Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, `Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His master said to him, `Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, `Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But his master answered him, `You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not winnowed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he will place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the King will say to those at his right hand, `Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the righteous will answer him, `Lord, when did we see thee hungry and feed thee, or thirsty and give thee drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when did we see thee a stranger and welcome thee, or naked and clothe thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when did we see thee sick or in prison and visit thee?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King will answer them, `Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he will say to those at his left hand, `Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then they also will answer, `Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to thee?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he will answer them, `Truly, I say to you, as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
