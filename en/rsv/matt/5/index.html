It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"You have heard that it was said to the men of old, `You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council, and whoever says, `You fool!' shall be liable to the hell of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Make friends quickly with your accuser, while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"You have heard that it was said, `You shall not commit adultery.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"It was also said, `Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old, `You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Let what you say be simply `Yes' or `No'; anything more than this comes from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"You have heard that it was said, `An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and if any one would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and if any one forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him who begs from you, and do not refuse him who would borrow from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"You have heard that it was said, `You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you salute only your brethren, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
