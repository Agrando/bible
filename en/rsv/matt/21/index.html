Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, "Who is this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the crowds said, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said to them, "It is written, `My house shall be called a house of prayer'; but you make it a den of robbers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and they said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes; have you never read, `Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast brought perfect praise'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, "May no fruit ever come from you again!" And the fig tree withered at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the disciples saw it they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither at once?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and never doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, `Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you a question; and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven or from men?" And they argued with one another, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will say to us, `Why then did you not believe him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we say, `From men,' we are afraid of the multitude; for all hold that John was a prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and said, `Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he answered, `I will not'; but afterward he repented and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he went to the second and said the same; and he answered, `I go, sir,' but did not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Hear another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to tenants, and went into another country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to get his fruit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again he sent other servants, more than the first; and they did the same to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Afterward he sent his son to them, saying, `They will respect my son.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, `This is the heir; come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They said to him, "He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the scriptures: `The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him to be a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
