And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to the attendants, `Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but few are chosen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him in his talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Hero'di-ans, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, "Why put me to the test, you hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the money for the tax." And they brought him a coin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they heard it, they marveled; and they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day Sad'ducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, "Teacher, Moses said, `If a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So too the second and third, down to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After them all, the woman died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In the resurrection, therefore, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>`I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sad'ducees, they came together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, to test him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the great and first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said to them, "How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put thy enemies under thy feet'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David thus calls him Lord, how is he his son?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any one dare to ask him any more questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
