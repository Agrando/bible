What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, "Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, "For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another, commits adultery."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but Jesus said, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he laid his hands on them and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, one came up to him, saying, "Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? One there is who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him, "Which?" And Jesus said, "You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to him, "All these I have observed; what do I still lack?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly, I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus looked at them and said to them, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter said in reply, "Lo, we have left everything and followed you. What then shall we have?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many that are first will be last, and the last first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
