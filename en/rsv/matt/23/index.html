For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you say, `If any one swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, justice and mercy and faith; these you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and rapacity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You blind Pharisee! first cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate, that the outside also may be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>saying, `If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechari'ah the son of Barachi'ah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Truly, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, `Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
