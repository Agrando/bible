And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>While the people of Israel were encamped in Gilgal they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And on the morrow after the passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they ate of the produce of the land; and the people of Israel had manna no more, but ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood before him with his drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, "No; but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, "What does my lord bid his servant?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, "Put off your shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy." And Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
