Yet there shall be a space between you and it, a distance of about two thousand cubits; do not come near it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass on before the people." And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Joshua, "This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, `When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua said to the people of Israel, "Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Per'izzites, the Gir'gashites, the Amorites, and the Jeb'usites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is to pass over before you into the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be stopped from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So, when the people set out from their tents, to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap far off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zar'ethan, and those flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off; and the people passed over opposite Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And while all Israel were passing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
