And the men went up and spied out Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, "Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are but few."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So about three thousand went up there from the people; and they fled before the men of Ai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six men of them, and chased them before the gate as far as Sheb'arim, and slew them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The LORD said to Joshua, "Arise, why have you thus fallen upon your face?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, and lied, and put them among their own stuff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become a thing for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Up, sanctify the people, and say, `Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, God of Israel, "There are devoted things in the midst of you, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies, until you take away the devoted things from among you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes; and the tribe which the LORD takes shall come near by families; and the family which the LORD takes shall come near by households; and the household which the LORD takes shall come near man by man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done a shameful thing in Israel.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he brought near the families of Judah, and the family of the Zer'ahites was taken; and he brought near the family of the Zer'ahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel, and render praise to him; and tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Achan answered Joshua, "Of a truth I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them, and took them; and behold, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the people of Israel; and they laid them down before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the mantle and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters, and his oxen and asses and sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua said, "Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD brings trouble on you today." And all Israel stoned him with stones; they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day; then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
