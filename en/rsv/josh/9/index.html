And Joshua said to them, "Who are you? And where do you come from?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They said to him, "From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God; for we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ash'taroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, `Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, "We are your servants; come now, make a covenant with us."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is our bread; it was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey, on the day we set forth to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and moldy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>these wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they are burst; and these garments and shoes of ours are worn out from the very long journey."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the men partook of their provisions, and did not ask direction from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephi'rah, Be-er'oth, and Kir'iath-je'arim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the people of Israel did not kill them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But all the leaders said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This we will do to them, and let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders had said of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, "Why did you deceive us, saying, `We are very far from you,' when you dwell among us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall always be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They answered Joshua, "Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; so we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and did this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, behold, we are in your hand: do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel; and they did not kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to continue to this day, in the place which he should choose.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
