And when they come out against us, as before, we shall flee before them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, `They are fleeing from us, as before.' So we will flee from them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city; for the LORD your God will give it into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire, doing as the LORD has bidden; see, I have commanded you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the place of ambush, and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, with the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the fighting men who were with him went up, and drew near before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they stationed the forces, the main encampment which was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the king of Ai saw this he and all his people, the men of the city, made haste and went out early to the descent toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua and all Israel made a pretense of being beaten before them, and fled in the direction of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, who did not go out after Israel; they left the city open, and pursued Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand." And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and took it; and they made haste to set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and smote the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the others came forth from the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and Israel smote them, until there was left none that survived or escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When Israel had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as their booty, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Joshua burned Ai, and made it for ever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Joshua built an altar in Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, "an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man has lifted an iron tool"; and they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all Israel, sojourner as well as homeborn, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, half of them in front of Mount Ger'izim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
