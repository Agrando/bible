Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD hearkened to the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makke'dah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told Joshua, "The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makke'dah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joshua said, "Roll great stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but do not stay there yourselves, pursue your enemies, fall upon their rear, do not let them enter their cities; for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Joshua and the men of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were wiped out, and when the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makke'dah; not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out to me from the cave."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, "Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings." Then they came near, and put their feet on their necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and of good courage; for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And afterward Joshua smote them and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees. And they hung upon the trees until evening;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set great stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua took Makke'dah on that day, and smote it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed every person in it, he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makke'dah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Joshua passed on from Makke'dah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joshua passed on from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and laid siege to it, and assaulted it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he left none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Joshua passed on with all Israel from Lachish to Eglon; and they laid siege to it, and assaulted it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and every person in it he utterly destroyed that day, as he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Joshua went up with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron; and they assaulted it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it; he left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and utterly destroyed it with every person in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Joshua, with all Israel, turned back to Debir and assaulted it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and he took it with its king and all its towns; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person in it; he left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Joshua defeated the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Joshua defeated them from Ka'desh-bar'nea to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
