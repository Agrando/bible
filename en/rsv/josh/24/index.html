I gave him Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Se'ir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it; and afterwards I brought you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did to Egypt; and you lived in the wilderness a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan; they fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel; and he sent and invited Balaam the son of Be'or to curse you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you; so I delivered you out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the men of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Per'izzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Gir'gashites, the Hivites, and the Jeb'usites; and I gave them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you dwell therein; you eat the fruit of vineyards and oliveyards which you did not plant.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if you be unwilling to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land; therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Joshua said to the people, "You cannot serve the LORD; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people said to Joshua, "Nay; but we will serve the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him." And they said, "We are witnesses."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, "Then put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD, the God of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the people said to Joshua, "The LORD our God we will serve, and his voice we will obey."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us; therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they buried him in his own inheritance at Tim'nath-se'rah, which is in the hill country of E'phraim, north of the mountain of Ga'ash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work which the LORD did for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The bones of Joseph which the people of Israel brought up from Egypt were buried at Shechem, in the portion of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money; it became an inheritance of the descendants of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Elea'zar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gib'e-ah, the town of Phin'ehas his son, which had been given him in the hill country of E'phraim.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
