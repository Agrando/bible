And when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>he said to them, "Go back to your homes with much wealth, and with very many cattle, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much clothing; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh returned home, parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of which they had possessed themselves by command of the LORD through Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they came to the region about the Jordan, that lies in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of great size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the people of Israel heard say, "Behold, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh have built an altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the people of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh, to make war against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the people of Israel sent to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh, in the land of Gilead, Phin'ehas the son of Elea'zar the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manas'seh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, `What is this treachery which you have committed against the God of Israel in turning away this day from following the LORD, by building yourselves an altar this day in rebellion against the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have we not had enough of the sin at Pe'or from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the congregation of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? And if you rebel against the LORD today he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But now, if your land is unclean, pass over into the LORD's land where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us; only do not rebel against the LORD, or make us as rebels by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manas'seh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith toward the LORD, spare us not today</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for building an altar to turn away from following the LORD; or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or cereal offerings or peace offerings on it, may the LORD himself take vengeance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nay, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, `What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you Reubenites and Gadites; you have no portion in the LORD.' So your children might make our children cease to worship the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore we said, `Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations after us, that we do perform the service of the LORD in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings; lest your children say to our children in time to come, "You have no portion in the LORD."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we thought, If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, `Behold the copy of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offering, cereal offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Phin'ehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manas'sites spoke, it pleased them well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Phin'ehas the son of Elea'zar the priest said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manas'sites, "Today we know that the LORD is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this treachery against the LORD; now you have saved the people of Israel from the hand of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Phin'ehas the son of Elea'zar the priest, and the chiefs, returned from the Reubenites and the Gadites in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the report pleased the people of Israel; and the people of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them, to destroy the land where the Reubenites and the Gadites were settled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Reubenites and the Gadites called the altar Witness; "For," said they, "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
