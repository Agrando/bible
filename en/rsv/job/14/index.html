There is not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Since his days are determined, and the number of his months is with thee, and thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>look away from him, and desist, that he may enjoy, like a hireling, his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"For there is hope for a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stump die in the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth branches like a young plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But man dies, and is laid low; man breathes his last, and where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As waters fail from a lake, and a river wastes away and dries up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so man lies down and rises not again; till the heavens are no more he will not awake, or be roused out of his sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, that thou wouldest conceal me until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my service I would wait, till my release should come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee; thou wouldest long for the work of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For then thou wouldest number my steps, thou wouldest not keep watch over my sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>my transgression would be sealed up in a bag, and thou wouldest cover over my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"But the mountain falls and crumbles away, and the rock is removed from its place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the waters wear away the stones; the torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so thou destroyest the hope of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passes; thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; they are brought low, and he perceives it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He feels only the pain of his own body, and he mourns only for himself."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
