Do you observe the calving of the hinds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Can you number the months that they fulfil, and do you know the time when they bring forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>when they crouch, bring forth their offspring, and are delivered of their young?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open; they go forth, and do not return to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Who has let the wild ass go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>to whom I have given the steppe for his home, and the salt land for his dwelling place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He scorns the tumult of the city; he hears not the shouts of the driver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He ranges the mountains as his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will he spend the night at your crib?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes, or will he harrow the valleys after you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will you depend on him because his strength is great, and will you leave to him your labor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Do you have faith in him that he will return, and bring your grain to your threshing floor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; but are they the pinions and plumage of love?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For she leaves her eggs to the earth, and lets them be warmed on the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>forgetting that a foot may crush them, and that the wild beast may trample them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers; though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because God has made her forget wisdom, and given her no share in understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When she rouses herself to flee, she laughs at the horse and his rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Do you give the horse his might?

He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and spreads his wings toward the south?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>On the rock he dwells and makes his home in the fastness of the rocky crag.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thence he spies out the prey; his eyes behold it afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>His young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there is he."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
