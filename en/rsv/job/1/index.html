Thus Job did continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The LORD said to Satan, "Whence have you come?" Satan answered the LORD, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nought?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hast thou not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse thee to thy face."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself do not put forth your hand." So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and there came a messenger to Job, and said, "The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the Sabe'ans fell upon them and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "The Chalde'ans formed three companies, and made a raid upon the camels and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return; the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
