Yet who can keep from speaking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Think now, who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off+?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Now a word was brought to me stealthily, my ear received the whisper of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`an mortal man be righteous before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Between morning and evening they are destroyed; they perish for ever without any regarding it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If their tent-cord is plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
