There is no end to your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The man with power possessed the land, and the favored man dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless were crushed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore snares are round about you, and sudden terror overwhelms you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>your light is darkened, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Is not God high in the heavens?
