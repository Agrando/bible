And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Sama'ria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Philip went down to a city of Sama'ria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So there was much joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But there was a man named Simon who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the nation of Sama'ria, saying that he himself was somebody great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is that power of God which is called Great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Sama'ria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, "Give me also this power, that any one on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, "Your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." This is a desert road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he rose and went. And behold, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a minister of the Can'dace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and was returning; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, "How can I, unless some one guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this: "As a sheep led to the slaughter or a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken up from the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the eunuch said to Philip, "About whom, pray, does the prophet say this, about himself or about some one else?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "See, here is water! What is to prevent my being baptized?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Philip was found at Azo'tus, and passing on he preached the gospel to all the towns till he came to Caesare'a.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
