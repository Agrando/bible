He sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer; and being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Paul went down and bent over him, and embracing him said, "Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they took the lad away alive, and were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mityle'ne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chi'os; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we came to Mile'tus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And from Mile'tus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came to him, he said to them:  "You yourselves know how I lived among you all the time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which befell me through the plots of the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance to God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what shall befall me there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, behold, I know that all you among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God which he obtained with the blood of his own Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In all things I have shown you that by so toiling one must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, `It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he had spoken thus, he knelt down and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all wept and embraced Paul and kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>sorrowing most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
