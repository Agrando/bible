And he sprang up and walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycao'nian, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out among the multitude, crying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jews came there from Antioch and Ico'nium; and having persuaded the people, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city; and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Ico'nium and to Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they passed through Pisid'ia, and came to Pamphyl'ia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attali'a;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they remained no little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
