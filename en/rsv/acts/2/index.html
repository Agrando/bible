and they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and manifest day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But God raised him up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says concerning him, `I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will dwell in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou wilt not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let thy Holy One see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy presence.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he testified with many other words and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all who believed were together and had all things in common;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as any had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
