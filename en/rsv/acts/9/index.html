And he said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Anani'as. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Anani'as." And he said, "Here I am, Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he has seen a man named Anani'as come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Anani'as answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Anani'as departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and took food and was strengthened.  For several days he was with the disciples at Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in the synagogues immediately he proclaimed Jesus, saying, "He is the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all who heard him were amazed, and said, "Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name? And he has come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but his disciples took him by night and let him down over the wall, lowering him in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he had come to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists; but they were seeking to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesare'a, and sent him off to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Sama'ria had peace and was built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints that lived at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>There he found a man named Aene'as, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said to him, "Aene'as, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed." And immediately he rose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now there was at Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In those days she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him entreating him, "Please come to us without delay."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So Peter rose and went with them. And when he had come, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping, and showing tunics and other garments which Dorcas made while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, rise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
