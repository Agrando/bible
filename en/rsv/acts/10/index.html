And he said to him, "Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now send men to Joppa, and bring one Simon who is called Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those that waited on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The next day, as they were on their journey and coming near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he became hungry and desired something to eat; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and saw the heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came a voice to him, "Rise, Peter; kill and eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, "No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the voice came to him again a second time, "What God has cleansed, you must not call common."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rise and go down, and accompany them without hesitation; for I have sent them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter went down to the men and said, "I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear what you have to say."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he called them in to be his guests.  The next day he rose and went off with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And on the following day they entered Caesare'a. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his kinsmen and close friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Cornelius said, "Four days ago, about this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>saying, `Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the seaside.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So I sent to you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter opened his mouth and said: "Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but in every nation any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You know the word which he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>the word which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses to all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but God raised him on the third day and made him manifest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>To him all the prophets bear witness that every one who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter was still saying this, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the believers from among the circumcised who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
