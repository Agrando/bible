And they had John to assist them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But El'ymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said, "You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind and unable to see the sun for a time." Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphyl'ia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but they passed on from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisid'ia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:  "Men of Israel, and you that fear God, listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And for about forty years he bore with them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; of whom he testified and said, `I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of this man's posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as John was finishing his course, he said, `What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death, yet they asked Pilate to have him killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised him from the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, `Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he spoke in this way, `I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore he says also in another psalm, `Thou wilt not let thy Holy One see corruption.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David, after he had served the counsel of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Let it be known to you therefore, brethren, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and by him every one that believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Beware, therefore, lest there come upon you what is said in the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>`Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I do a deed in your days, a deed you will never believe, if one declares it to you.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The next sabbath almost the whole city gathered together to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and reviled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, "It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, `I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of God; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the word of the Lord spread throughout all the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went to Ico'nium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
