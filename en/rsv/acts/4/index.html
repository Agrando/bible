For that a notable sign has been performed through them is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to any one in this name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for all men praised God for what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they were released they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, didst say by the Holy Spirit, `Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed'--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for truly in this city there were gathered together against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do whatever thy hand and thy plan had predestined to take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>while thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of thy holy servant Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and laid it at the apostles' feet; and distribution was made to each as any had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus Joseph who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>sold a field which belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
