These six brethren also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, `Send to Joppa and bring Simon called Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, `John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard this they were silenced. And they glorified God, saying, "Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoeni'cia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none except Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyre'ne, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number that believed turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad; and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large company was added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church, and taught a large company of people; and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of them named Ag'abus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world; and this took place in the days of Claudius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brethren who lived in Judea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
