I appeal to Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Berni'ce arrived at Caesare'a to welcome Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a man left prisoner by Felix;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information about him, asking for sentence against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one before the accused met the accusers face to face, and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When therefore they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but they had certain points of dispute with him about their own superstition and about one Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be held until I could send him to Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, "I should like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," said he, "you shall hear him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So on the morrow Agrippa and Berni'ce came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then by command of Festus Paul was brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I found that he had done nothing deserving death; and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you, and, especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
