Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were outside the city; and kneeling down on the beach we prayed and bade one another farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolema'is; and we greeted the brethren and stayed with them for one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the morrow we departed and came to Caesare'a; and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>While we were staying for some days, a prophet named Ag'abus came down from Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, `So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this girdle and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, "The will of the Lord be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After these days we made ready and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And some of the disciples from Caesare'a went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; they are all zealous for the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you yourself live in observance of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from unchastity."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, to give notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, who had seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd, and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching men everywhere against the people and the law and this place; moreover he also brought Greeks into the temple, and he has defiled this holy place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they had previously seen Troph'imus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then all the city was aroused, and the people ran together; they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they were trying to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He at once took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the tribune came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for the mob of the people followed, crying, "Away with him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, "May I say something to you?" And he said, "Do you know Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Paul replied, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cili'cia, a citizen of no mean city; I beg you, let me speak to the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
