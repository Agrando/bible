This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." And the chains fell off his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the angel said to him, "Dress yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he said to him, "Wrap your mantle around you and follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Peter came to himself, and said, "Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and told that Peter was standing at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They said to her, "You are mad." But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Tell this to James and to the brethren." Then he departed and went to another place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when day came, there was no small stir among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when Herod had sought for him and could not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesare'a, and remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they came to him in a body, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and made an oration to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was eaten by worms and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the word of God grew and multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, bringing with them John whose other name was Mark.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
