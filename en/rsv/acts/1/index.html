This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was numbered among us, and was allotted his share in this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akel'dama, that is, Field of Blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms, `Let his habitation become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it'; and `His office let another take.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us--one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsab'bas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthi'as.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed and said, "Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which one of these two thou hast chosen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthi'as; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
