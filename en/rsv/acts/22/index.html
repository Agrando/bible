And he said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cili'cia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gama'li-el, educated according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as you all are this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>as the high priest and the whole council of elders bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brethren, and I journeyed to Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I answered, `Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, `I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I said, `What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, `Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"And one Anani'as, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>came to me, and standing by me said to me, `Brother Saul, receive your sight.' And in that very hour I received my sight and saw him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, `The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Just One and to hear a voice from his mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and saw him saying to me, `Make haste and get quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said, `Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by and approving, and keeping the garments of those who killed him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to me, `Depart; for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Up to this word they listened to him; then they lifted up their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he ought not to live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as they cried out and waved their garments and threw dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the tribune commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by scourging, to find out why they shouted thus against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen, and uncondemned?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the tribune came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" And he said, "Yes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The tribune answered, "I bought this citizenship for a large sum." Paul said, "But I was born a citizen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him instantly; and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But on the morrow, desiring to know the real reason why the Jews accused him, he unbound him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
