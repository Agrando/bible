And some said, "What would this babbler say?" Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities"--because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took hold of him and brought him to the Are-op'agus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is which you present?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you bring some strange things to our ears; we wish to know therefore what these things mean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Paul, standing in the middle of the Are-op'agus, said: "Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, `To an unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for `In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your poets have said, `For we are indeed his offspring.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, a representation by the art and imagination of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We will hear you again about this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul went out from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some men joined him and believed, among them Dionys'ius the Are-op'agite and a woman named Dam'aris and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
