You will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
