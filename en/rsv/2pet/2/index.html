Bold and wilful, they are not afraid to revile the glorious ones,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a reviling judgment upon them before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed, reviling in matters of which they are ignorant, will be destroyed in the same destruction with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>suffering wrong for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their dissipation, carousing with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Forsaking the right way they have gone astray; they have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Be'or, who loved gain from wrongdoing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but was rebuked for his own transgression; a dumb ass spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm; for them the nether gloom of darkness has been reserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, uttering loud boasts of folly, they entice with licentious passions of the flesh men who have barely escaped from those who live in error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a man, to that he is enslaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overpowered, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It has happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog turns back to his own vomit, and the sow is washed only to wallow in the mire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
