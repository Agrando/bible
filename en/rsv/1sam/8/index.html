And Samuel prayed to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, "Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According to all the deeds which they have done to me, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now then, hearken to their voice; only, you shall solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking a king from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said, "These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will take your menservants and maidservants, and the best of your cattle and your asses, and put them to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the LORD will not answer you in that day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, "No! but we will have a king over us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, "Hearken to their voice, and make them a king." Samuel then said to the men of Israel, "Go every man to his city."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
