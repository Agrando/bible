And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it they were afraid of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the people of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD; and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel; but the LORD thundered with a mighty voice that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion; and they were routed before Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Jesha'nah, and called its name Ebene'zer; for he said, "Hitherto the LORD has helped us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel rescued their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all these places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he would come back to Ramah, for his home was there, and there also he administered justice to Israel. And he built there an altar to the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
