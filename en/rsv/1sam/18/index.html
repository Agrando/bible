And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As they were coming home, when David returned from slaying the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with timbrels, with songs of joy, and with instruments of music.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the women sang to one another as they made merry, "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; he said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; and what more can he have but the kingdom?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Saul eyed David from that day on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the morrow an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Saul cast the spear, for he thought, "I will pin David to the wall." But David evaded him twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David had success in all his undertakings; for the LORD was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Saul said to David, "Here is my elder daughter Merab; I will give her to you for a wife; only be valiant for me and fight the LORD'S battles." For Saul thought, "Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David said to Saul, "Who am I, and who are my kinsfolk, my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to A'driel the Meho'lathite for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Saul thought, "Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." Therefore Saul said to David a second time, "You shall now be my son-in-law."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David in private and say, `Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you; now then become the king's son-in-law.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, "Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and of no repute?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the servants of Saul told him, "Thus and so did David speak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Saul said, "Thus shall you say to David, `The king desires no marriage present except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king's enemies.'" Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. Before the time had expired,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines; and David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that all Israel loved him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David's enemy continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the princes of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was highly esteemed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
