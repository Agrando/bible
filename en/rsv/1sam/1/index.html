And Penin'nah had children, but Hannah had no children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin'ehas, were priests of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>On the day when Elka'nah sacrificed, he would give portions to Penin'nah his wife and to all her sons and daughters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and, although he loved Hannah, he would give Hannah only one portion, because the LORD had closed her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her rival used to provoke her sorely, to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elka'nah, her husband, said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow and said, "O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy maidservant, and remember me, and not forget thy maidservant, but wilt give to thy maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman sorely troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not regard your maidservant as a base woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered, "Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have made to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, "Let your maidservant find favor in your eyes." Then the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no longer sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elka'nah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, "I have asked him of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elka'nah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and to pay his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, that he may appear in the presence of the LORD, and abide there for ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Elka'nah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine; and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh; and the child was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then they slew the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, "Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this child I prayed; and the LORD has granted me my petition which I made to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD."  And they worshiped the LORD there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
