So the Ken'ites departed from among the Amal'ekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul defeated the Amal'ekites, from Hav'ilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag the king of the Amal'ekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; all that was despised and worthless they utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The word of the LORD came to Samuel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I repent that I have made Saul king; for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments." And Samuel was angry; and he cried to the LORD all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed be you to the LORD; I have performed the commandment of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amal'ekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said to me this night." And he said to him, "Say on."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, "Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, `Go, utterly destroy the sinners, the Amal'ekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you swoop on the spoil, and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said to Samuel, "I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me, I have brought Agag the king of Am'alek, and I have utterly destroyed the Amal'ekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said, "Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, I pray, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As Samuel turned to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, "I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned back after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Samuel said, "Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amal'ekites." And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women." And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gib'e-ah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
