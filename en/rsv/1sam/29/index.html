And A'chish said to the commanders of the Philistines, "Is not this David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me now for days and years, and since he deserted to me I have found no fault in him to this day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him; and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place to which you have assigned him; he shall not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not this David, of whom they sing to one another in dances, `Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then A'chish called David and said to him, "As the LORD lives, you have been honest, and to me it seems right that you should march out and in with me in the campaign; for I have found nothing wrong in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless the lords do not approve of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So go back now; and go peaceably, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to A'chish, "But what have I done?
