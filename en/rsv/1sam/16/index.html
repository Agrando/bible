Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me." And the LORD said, "Take a heifer with you, and say, `I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me him whom I name to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Samuel did what the LORD commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, "Do you come peaceably?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said, "Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD; consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice." And he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they came, he looked on Eli'ab and thought, "Surely the LORD'S anointed is before him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the LORD sees not as man sees; man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Jesse called Abin'adab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all your sons here?" And he said, "There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep." And Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he comes here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD tormented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul's servants said to him, "Behold now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let our lord now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who is skilful in playing the lyre; and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Saul said to his servants, "Provide for me a man who can play well, and bring him to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>One of the young men answered, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilful in playing, a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the LORD is with him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, "Send me David your son, who is with the sheep."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a skin of wine and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to Saul, and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And whenever the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
