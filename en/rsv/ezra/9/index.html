And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When I heard this, I rent my garments and my mantle, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat appalled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered round me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And at the evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garments and my mantle rent, and fell upon my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>saying:  "O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to thee, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt; and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant, and to give us a secure hold within his holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are bondmen; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection in Judea and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken thy commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>which thou didst command by thy servants the prophets, saying, `The land which you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that thou, our God, hast punished us less than our iniquities deserved and hast given us such a remnant as this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>shall we break thy commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Wouldst thou not be angry with us till thou wouldst consume us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O LORD the God of Israel, thou art just, for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as at this day. Behold, we are before thee in our guilt, for none can stand before thee because of this."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
