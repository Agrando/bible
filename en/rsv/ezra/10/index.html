So they took the oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Jehoha'nan the son of Eli'ashib, where he spent the night, neither eating bread nor drinking water; for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and that if any one did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited, and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have trespassed and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now then make confession to the LORD the God of your fathers, and do his will; separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, "It is so; we must do as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a work for one day or for two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let our officials stand for the whole assembly; let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every city, till the fierce wrath of our God over this matter be averted from us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only Jonathan the son of As'ahel and Jahzei'ah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshul'lum and Shab'bethai the Levite supported them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men, heads of fathers' houses, according to their fathers' houses, each of them designated by name.
