You will find in the book of the records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that sedition was stirred up in it from of old. That was why this city was laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We make known to the king that, if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished, you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The king sent an answer: "To Rehum the commander and Shim'shai the scribe and the rest of their associates who live in Sama'ria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, greeting.
