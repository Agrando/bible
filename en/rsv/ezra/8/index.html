Of the sons of Ith'amar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>of the sons of Shecani'ah.

As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there none of the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then I sent for Elie'zer, Ar'i-el, Shemai'ah, Elna'than, Jarib, Elna'than, Nathan, Zechari'ah, and Meshul'lam, leading men, and for Joi'arib and Elna'than, who were men of insight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphi'a, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brethren the temple servants at the place Casiphi'a, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebi'ah with his sons and kinsmen, eighteen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>also Hashabi'ah and with him Jeshai'ah of the sons of Merar'i, with his kinsmen and their sons, twenty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>besides two hundred and twenty of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all mentioned by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Aha'va, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a straight way for ourselves, our children, and all our goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way; since we had told the king, "The hand of our God is for good upon all that seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all that forsake him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebi'ah, Hashabi'ah, and ten of their kinsmen with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I weighed out into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels worth a hundred talents, and a hundred talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>twenty bowls of gold worth a thousand darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze as precious as gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then we departed from the river Aha'va on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed into the hands of Mer'emoth the priest, son of Uri'ah, and with him was Elea'zar the son of Phin'ehas, and with them were the Levites, Jo'zabad the son of Jeshua and No-adi'ah the son of Bin'nui.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve he-goats; all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They also delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River; and they aided the people and the house of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
