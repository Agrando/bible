And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jez'ebel his wife came to him, and said to him, "Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, `Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it'; and he answered, `I will not give you my vineyard.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jez'ebel his wife said to him, "Do you now govern Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who dwelt with Naboth in his city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she wrote in the letters, "Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and set two base fellows opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, `You have cursed God and the king.' Then take him out, and stone him to death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jez'ebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters which she had sent to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>they proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the two base fellows came in and sat opposite him; and the base fellows brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then they sent to Jez'ebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned; he is dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As soon as Jez'ebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jez'ebel said to Ahab, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the word of the LORD came to Eli'jah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Sama'ria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall say to him, `Thus says the LORD, "Have you killed, and also taken possession?"' And you shall say to him, `Thus says the LORD: "In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ahab said to Eli'jah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" He answered, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, I will bring evil upon you; I will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will make your house like the house of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba'asha the son of Ahi'jah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of Jez'ebel the LORD also said, `The dogs shall eat Jez'ebel within the bounds of Jezreel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Any one belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one of his who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD like Ahab, whom Jez'ebel his wife incited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He did very abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD cast out before the people of Israel.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Ahab heard those words, he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about dejectedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the word of the LORD came to Eli'jah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days I will bring the evil upon his house."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
