And he ate and drank, and lay down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel of the LORD came again a second time, and touched him, and said, "Arise and eat, else the journey will be too great for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there he came to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, "What are you doing here, Eli'jah?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said, "I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, "Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD." And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Eli'jah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him, and said, "What are you doing here, Eli'jah?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said, "I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, you shall anoint Haz'ael to be king over Syria;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel; and Eli'sha the son of Shaphat of A'bel-meho'lah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And him who escapes from the sword of Haz'ael shall Jehu slay; and him who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Eli'sha slay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Ba'al, and every mouth that has not kissed him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he departed from there, and found Eli'sha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Eli'jah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he left the oxen, and ran after Eli'jah, and said, "Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you." And he said to him, "Go back again; for what have I done to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Eli'jah, and ministered to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
