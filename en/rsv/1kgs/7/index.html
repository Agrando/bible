Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All these were made of costly stones, hewn according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the court of the house of the LORD to the great court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And above were costly stones, hewn according to measurement, and cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The great court had three courses of hewn stone round about, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the vestibule of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naph'tali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill, for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon, and did all his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference; it was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers; the second pillar was the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He also made two capitals of molten bronze, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he made two nets of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals upon the tops of the pillars; a net for the one capital, and a net for the other capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Likewise he made pomegranates; in two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capital that was upon the top of the pillar; and he did the same with the other capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the capitals that were upon the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The capitals were upon the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the network; there were two hundred pomegranates, in two rows round about; and so with the other capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin; and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Bo'az.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And upon the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Under its brim were gourds, for thirty cubits, compassing the sea round about; the gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It stood upon twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He also made the ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. Upon the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moreover each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze; and at the four corners were supports for a laver. The supports were cast, with wreaths at the side of each.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Its opening was within a crown which projected upward one cubit; its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings; and its panels were square, not round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the four wheels were underneath the panels; the axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs, were all cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There were four supports at the four corners of each stand; the supports were of one piece with the stands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this manner he made the ten stands; all of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver held forty baths, each laver measured four cubits, and there was a laver for each of the ten stands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house; and he set the sea on the southeast corner of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>the ten stands, and the ten lavers upon the stands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the LORD, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not found out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
