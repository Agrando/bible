When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he killed all the house of Ba'asha; he did not leave him a single male of his kinsmen or his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Ba'asha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Ba'asha by Jehu the prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for all the sins of Ba'asha and the sins of Elah his son which they sinned, and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gib'bethon, which belonged to the Philistines,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the troops who were encamped heard it said, "Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king"; therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Omri went up from Gib'bethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king's house, and burned the king's house over him with fire, and died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because of his sins which he committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jerobo'am, and for his sin which he committed, making Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy which he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri became king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He bought the hill of Sama'ria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he fortified the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Sama'ria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did more evil than all who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he walked in all the way of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, and in the sins which he made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Sama'ria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Sama'ria twenty-two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all that were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, he took for wife Jez'ebel the daughter of Ethba'al king of the Sido'nians, and went and served Ba'al, and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He erected an altar for Ba'al in the house of Ba'al, which he built in Sama'ria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Ahab made an Ashe'rah. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>In his days Hi'el of Bethel built Jericho; he laid its foundation at the cost of Abi'ram his first-born, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
