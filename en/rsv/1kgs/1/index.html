He was also a very handsome man; and he was born next after Ab'salom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He conferred with Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah and with Abi'athar the priest; and they followed Adoni'jah and helped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Zadok the priest, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shim'e-i, and Re'i, and David's mighty men were not with Adoni'jah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Adoni'jah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatlings by the Serpent's Stone, which is beside En-ro'gel, and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benai'ah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Nathan said to Bathshe'ba the mother of Solomon, "Have you not heard that Adoni'jah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore come, let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go in at once to King David, and say to him, `Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your maidservant, saying, "Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne"? Why then is Adoni'jah king?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Bathshe'ba went to the king into his chamber (now the king was very old, and Ab'ishag the Shu'nammite was ministering to the king).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Bathshe'ba bowed and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, "What do you desire?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She said to him, "My lord, you swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God, saying, `Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now, behold, Adoni'jah is king, although you, my lord the king, do not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He has sacrificed oxen, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abi'athar the priest, and Jo'ab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they told the king, "Here is Nathan the prophet." And when he came in before the king, he bowed before the king, with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you said, `Adoni'jah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he has gone down this day, and has sacrificed oxen, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, Jo'ab the commander of the army, and Abi'athar the priest; and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, `Long live King Adoni'jah!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and your servant Solomon, he has not invited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then King David answered, "Call Bathshe'ba to me." So she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king swore, saying, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>as I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, `Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead'; even so will I do this day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Bathshe'ba bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, "May my lord King David live for ever!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>King David said, "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada." So they came before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there anoint him king over Israel; then blow the trumpet, and say, `Long live King Solomon!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>You shall then come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and the Cher'ethites and the Pel'ethites, went down and caused Solomon to ride on King David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>There Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent, and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, "Long live King Solomon!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the people went up after him, playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Adoni'jah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. And when Jo'ab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "What does this uproar in the city mean?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abi'athar the priest came; and Adoni'jah said, "Come in, for you are a worthy man and bring good news."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jonathan answered Adoni'jah, "No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and the Cher'ethites and the Pel'ethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Solomon sits upon the royal throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Moreover the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, `Your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.' And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the king also said, `Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted one of my offspring to sit on my throne this day, my own eyes seeing it.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then all the guests of Adoni'jah trembled, and rose, and each went his own way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Adoni'jah feared Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it was told Solomon, "Behold, Adoni'jah fears King Solomon; for, lo, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, `Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Solomon said, "If he prove to be a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, "Go to your house."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
