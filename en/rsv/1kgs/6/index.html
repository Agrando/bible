He also made an altar of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house; and the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts formed a pentagon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim and upon the palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied upon the carved work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone and one course of cedar beams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications.
