Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD loved Israel for ever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones; never again came such an abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover the fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, lyres also and harps for the singers; no such almug wood has come or been seen, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land, with her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>besides that which came from the traders and from the traffic of the merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and from the governors of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with the finest gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The throne had six steps, and at the back of the throne was a calf's head, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver, it was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephe'lah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Ku'e, and the king's traders received them from Ku'e at a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
