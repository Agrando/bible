So they are called the land of Cabul to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Hiram had sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the LORD and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megid'do and Gezer</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burnt it with fire, and had slain the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so Solomon rebuilt Gezer) and Lower Beth-hor'on</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Ba'alath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Per'izzites, the Hivites, and the Jeb'usites, who were not of the people of Israel--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel were unable to destroy utterly--these Solomon made a forced levy of slaves, and so they are to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves; they were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work: five hundred and fifty, who had charge of the people who carried on the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the city of David to her own house which Solomon had built for her; then he built the Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built to the LORD, burning incense before the LORD.
