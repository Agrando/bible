And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the word of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?" And they said, "Go up; for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jehosh'aphat said, "Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micai'ah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil." And Jehosh'aphat said, "Let not the king say so."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micai'ah the son of Imlah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Sama'ria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Zedeki'ah the son of Chena'anah made for himself horns of iron, and said, "Thus says the LORD, `With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, and said, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the messenger who went to summon Micai'ah said to him, "Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Micai'ah said, "As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I will speak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micai'ah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?" And he answered him, "Go up and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, "I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said, `These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Micai'ah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said one thing, and another said another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, `I will entice him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said to him, `By what means?' And he said, `I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he said, `You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth and do so.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the LORD has spoken evil concerning you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Zedeki'ah the son of Chena'anah came near and struck Micai'ah on the cheek, and said, "How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Micai'ah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king of Israel said, "Seize Micai'ah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Jo'ash the king's son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and say, `Thus says the king, "Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with scant fare of bread and water, until I come in peace."'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Micai'ah said, "If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Hear, all you peoples!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, "Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehosh'aphat, they said, "It is surely the king of Israel." So they turned to fight against him; and Jehosh'aphat cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died; and the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And about sunset a cry went through the army, "Every man to his city, and every man to his country!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So the king died, and was brought to Sama'ria; and they buried the king in Sama'ria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they washed the chariot by the pool of Sama'ria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves in it, according to the word of the LORD which he had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahazi'ah his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jehosh'aphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jehosh'aphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azu'bah the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD; yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jehosh'aphat also made peace with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehosh'aphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa, he exterminated from the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jehosh'aphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at E'zion-ge'ber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then Ahazi'ah the son of Ahab said to Jehosh'aphat, "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships," but Jehosh'aphat was not willing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jehosh'aphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jeho'ram his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ahazi'ah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Sama'ria in the seventeenth year of Jehosh'aphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He served Ba'al and worshiped him, and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger in every way that his father had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
