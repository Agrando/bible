Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then two harlots came to the king, and stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The one woman said, "Oh, my lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then on the third day after I was delivered, this woman also gave birth; and we were alone; there was no one else with us in the house, only we two were in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your maidservant slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I looked at it closely in the morning, behold, it was not the child that I had borne."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the other woman said, "No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours." The first said, "No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine." Thus they spoke before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the king said, "The one says, `This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead'; and the other says, `No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said, "Bring me a sword." So a sword was brought before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, because her heart yearned for her son, "Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means slay it." But the other said, "It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the king answered and said, "Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means slay it; she is its mother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered; and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him, to render justice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
