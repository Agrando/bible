And he said to him, "Only let me go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eli'ada, who had fled from his master Hadade'zer king of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the slaughter by David; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and made him king in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing mischief as Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, an E'phraimite of Zer'edah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeru'ah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The man Jerobo'am was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And at that time, when Jerobo'am went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahi'jah the Shi'lonite found him on the road. Now Ahi'jah had clad himself with a new garment; and the two of them were alone in the open country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Ahi'jah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to Jerobo'am, "Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, `Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because he has forsaken me, and worshiped Ash'toreth the goddess of the Sido'nians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and has not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if you will hearken to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will for this afflict the descendants of David, but not for ever.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jerobo'am; but Jerobo'am arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehobo'am his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
