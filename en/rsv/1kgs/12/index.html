Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke upon us, and we will serve you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He said to them, "Depart for three days, then come again to me." So the people went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then King Rehobo'am took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, "How do you advise me to answer this people?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said to him, "If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants for ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, "What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, `Lighten the yoke that your father put upon us'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, "Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, `Your father made our yoke heavy, but do you lighten it for us'; thus shall you say to them, `My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, whereas my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jerobo'am and all the people came to Rehobo'am the third day, as the king said, "Come to me again the third day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel which the old men had given him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king did not hearken to the people; for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfil his word, which the LORD spoke by Ahi'jah the Shi'lonite to Jerobo'am the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the people answered the king, "What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David." So Israel departed to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Rehobo'am reigned over the people of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then King Rehobo'am sent Ador'am, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehobo'am made haste to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when all Israel heard that Jerobo'am had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Rehobo'am came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehobo'am the son of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the word of God came to Shemai'ah the man of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Say to Rehobo'am the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>`Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your kinsmen the people of Israel. Return every man to his home, for this thing is from me.'" So they hearkened to the word of the LORD, and went home again, according to the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jerobo'am built Shechem in the hill country of E'phraim, and dwelt there; and he went out from there and built Penu'el.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jerobo'am said in his heart, "Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, to Rehobo'am king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to Rehobo'am king of Judah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, "You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this thing became a sin, for the people went to the one at Bethel and to the other as far as Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He also made houses on high places, and appointed priests from among all the people, who were not of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jerobo'am appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices upon the altar; so he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast for the people of Israel, and went up to the altar to burn incense.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
