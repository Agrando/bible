Now Ahi'jah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD said to Ahi'jah, "Behold, the wife of Jerobo'am is coming to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Thus and thus shall you say to her."  When she came, she pretended to be another woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Ahi'jah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jerobo'am; why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with heavy tidings for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, tell Jerobo'am, `Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: "Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you leader over my people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you; and yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments, and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but you have done evil above all that were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods, and molten images, provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jerobo'am, and will cut off from Jerobo'am every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will utterly consume the house of Jerobo'am, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Any one belonging to Jerobo'am who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat; for the LORD has spoken it."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Arise therefore, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jerobo'am shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing to the LORD, the God of Israel, in the house of Jerobo'am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover the LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jerobo'am today. And henceforth</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>the LORD will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and scatter them beyond the Euphra'tes, because they have made their Ashe'rim, provoking the LORD to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jerobo'am, which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jerobo'am's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. And as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahi'jah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jerobo'am, how he warred and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the time that Jerobo'am reigned was twenty-two years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now Rehobo'am the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehobo'am was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. His mother's name was Na'amah the Ammonitess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they also built for themselves high places, and pillars, and Ashe'rim on every high hill and under every green tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the fifth year of King Rehobo'am, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house; he took away everything. He also took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and King Rehobo'am made in their stead shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard bore them and brought them back to the guardroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the rest of the acts of Rehobo'am, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there was war between Rehobo'am and Jerobo'am continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Rehobo'am slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother's name was Na'amah the Ammonitess. And Abi'jam his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
