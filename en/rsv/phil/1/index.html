Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yes, and I shall rejoice. For I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I shall not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Convinced of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear omen to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>engaged in the same conflict which you saw and now hear to be mine.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
