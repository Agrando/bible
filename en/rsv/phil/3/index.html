To write the same things to you is not irksome to me, and is safe for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Look out for the dogs, look out for the evil-workers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For we are the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit, and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If any other man thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law a Pharisee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>as to zeal a persecutor of the church, as to righteousness under the law blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that if possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Brethren, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let those of us who are mature be thus minded; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, God will reveal that also to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Only let us hold true to what we have attained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Brethren, join in imitating me, and mark those who so live as you have an example in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But our commonwealth is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power which enables him even to subject all things to himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
