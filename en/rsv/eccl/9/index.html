Everything before them is vanity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>since one fate comes to all, to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As is the good man, so is the sinner; and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that one fate comes to all; also the hearts of men are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward; but the memory of them is lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and they have no more for ever any share in all that is done under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already approved what you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let your garments be always white; let not oil be lacking on your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life which he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to the men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For man does not know his time. Like fish which are taken in an evil net, and like birds which are caught in a snare, so the sons of men are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There was a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heeded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
