For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wisdom is good with an inheritance, an advantage to those who see the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money; and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Consider the work of God; who can make straight what he has made crooked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In my vain life I have seen everything; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not righteous overmuch, and do not make yourself overwise; why should you destroy yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be not wicked overmuch, neither be a fool; why should you die before your time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand; for he who fears God shall come forth from them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not give heed to all the things that men say, lest you hear your servant cursing you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>your heart knows that many times you have yourself cursed others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All this I have tested by wisdom; I said, "I will be wise"; but it was far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That which is, is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I turned my mind to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the sum of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness which is madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters; he who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, adding one thing to another to find the sum,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>which my mind has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
