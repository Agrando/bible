Pay what you vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake; why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For when dreams increase, empty words grow many: but do you fear God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you see in a province the poor oppressed and justice and right violently taken away, do not be amazed at the matter; for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in all, a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money; nor he who loves wealth, with gain: this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When goods increase, they increase who eat them; and what gain has their owner but to see them with his eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much; but the surfeit of the rich will not let him sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and those riches were lost in a bad venture; and he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil, which he may carry away in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go; and what gain has he that he toiled for the wind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and spent all his days in darkness and grief, in much vexation and sickness and resentment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, what I have seen to be good and to be fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life which God has given him, for this is his lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every man also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and find enjoyment in his toil--this is the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
