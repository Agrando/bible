I will send my beloved son; it may be they will respect him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, `This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy those tenants, and give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, they said, "God forbid!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he looked at them and said, "What then is this that is written: `The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but when it falls on any one it will crush him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on him at that very hour, but they feared the people; for they perceived that he had told this parable against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they watched him, and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might take hold of what he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They asked him, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Show me a coin. Whose likeness and inscription has it?" They said, "Caesar's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said; but marveling at his answer they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There came to him some Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and they asked him a question, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and died without children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the second</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Afterward the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for they cannot die any more, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you have spoken well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For they no longer dared to ask him any question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But he said to them, "How can they say that the Christ is David's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David thus calls him Lord; so how is he his son?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"Beware of the scribes, who like to go about in long robes, and love salutations in the market places and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
