Then he took him and healed him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, "Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull him out on a sabbath day?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they could not reply to this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose the places of honor, saying to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"When you are invited by any one to a marriage feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest a more eminent man than you be invited by him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he who invited you both will come and say to you, `Give place to this man,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, `Friend, go up higher'; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For every one who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He said also to the man who had invited him, "When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your kinsmen or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and you be repaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When one of those who sat at table with him heard this, he said to him, "Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said to him, "A man once gave a great banquet, and invited many;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, `Come; for all is now ready.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, `I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it; I pray you, have me excused.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, `I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them; I pray you, have me excused.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another said, `I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the servant came and reported this to his master. Then the householder in anger said to his servant, `Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and maimed and blind and lame.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant said, `Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the master said to the servant, `Go out to the highways and hedges, and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now great multitudes accompanied him; and he turned and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"If any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, `This man began to build, and was not able to finish.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king, going to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an embassy and asks terms of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So therefore, whoever of you does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Salt is good; but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltness be restored?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill; men throw it away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
