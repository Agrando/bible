Do not go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be terrified; for this must first take place, but the end will not be at once."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This will be a time for you to bear testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Settle it therefore in your minds, not to meditate beforehand how to answer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends, and some of you they will put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>you will be hated by all for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But not a hair of your head will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By your endurance you will gain your lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for these are days of vengeance, to fulfil all that is written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days!
