And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he had ceased speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Simon answered, "Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they had done this, they enclosed a great shoal of fish; and as their nets were breaking,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and so also were James and John, sons of Zeb'edee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and besought him, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he charged him to tell no one; but "go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But so much the more the report went abroad concerning him; and great multitudes gathered to hear and to be healed of their infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On one of those days, as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he saw their faith he said, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, "Why do you question in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, to say, `Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, `Rise and walk'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the man who was paralyzed--"I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately he rose before them, and took up that on which he lay, and went home, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, "We have seen strange things today."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After this he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, "Follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he left everything, and rose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there was a large company of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus answered them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, "Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He told them a parable also: "No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it upon an old garment; if he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And no one after drinking old wine desires new; for he says, `The old is good.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
