And he divided his living between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in loose living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had spent everything, a great famine arose in that country, and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he would gladly have fed on the pods that the swine ate; and no one gave him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when he came to himself he said, `How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, but I perish here with hunger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose and came to his father. But while he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, `Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, `Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to make merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, `Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but he answered his father, `Lo, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, `Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It was fitting to make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
