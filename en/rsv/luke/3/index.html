Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bear fruits that befit repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the multitudes asked him, "What then shall we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he answered them, "He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, "Collect no more than is appointed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Soldiers also asked him, "And we, what shall we do?"
