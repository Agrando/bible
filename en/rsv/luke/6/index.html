And he rose and stood there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he looked around on them all, and said to him, "Stretch out your hand." And he did so, and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In these days he went out to the mountain to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, he called his disciples, and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came forth from him and healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: "Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. "Blessed are you that weep now, for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"But woe to you that are rich, for you have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Woe to you that are full now, for you shall hunger. "Woe to you that laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Woe to you, when all men speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"But I say to you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to every one who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the selfish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He also told them a parable: "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A disciple is not above his teacher, but every one when he is fully taught will be like his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil; for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"Why do you call me `Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he is like a man building a house, who dug deep, and laid the foundation upon rock; and when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it had been well built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
