Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the second came, saying, `Lord, your pound has made five pounds.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, `And you are to be over five cities.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then another came, saying, `Lord, here is your pound, which I kept laid away in a napkin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He said to him, `I will condemn you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Why then did you not put my money into the bank, and at my coming I should have collected it with interest?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to those who stood by, `Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has the ten pounds.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(And they said to him, `Lord, he has ten pounds!')</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he drew near to Beth'phage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, "Go into the village opposite, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring it here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If any one asks you, `Why are you untying it?' you shall say this, `The Lord has need of it.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So those who were sent went away and found it as he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, "The Lord has need of it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their garments on the colt they set Jesus upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he rode along, they spread their garments on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As he was now drawing near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He answered, "I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, "Would that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies will cast up a bank about you and surround you, and hem you in on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, "It is written, `My house shall be a house of prayer'; but you have made it a den of robbers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people hung upon his words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
