And they stood still, looking sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then one of them, named Cle'opas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since this happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and did not find his body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, "O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but they constrained him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who said, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do questionings rise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and he took it and ate before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then he said to them, "These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>You are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and were continually in the temple blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
