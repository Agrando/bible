Do this in remembrance of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And likewise the cup after supper, saying, "This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they began to question one another, which of them it was that would do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For which is the greater, one who sits at table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am among you as one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"You are those who have continued with me in my trials;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said, "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you three times deny that you know me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, "When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said to them, "But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag. And let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, `And he was reckoned with transgressors'; for what is written about me has its fulfilment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, "Look, Lord, here are two swords." And he said to them, "It is enough."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he came to the place he said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and he said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>but Jesus said to him, "Judas, would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But Jesus said, "No more of this!" And he touched his ear and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said, "This man also was with him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a little later some one else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, "Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying." And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he went out and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>they also blindfolded him and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And they spoke many other words against him, reviling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council, and they said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>"If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>and if I ask you, you will not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And they all said, "Are you the Son of God, then?" And he said to them, "You say that I am."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And they said, "What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
