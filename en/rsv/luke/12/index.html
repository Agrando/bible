And not one of them is forgotten before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And I tell you, every one who acknowledges me before men, the Son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every one who speaks a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you are to answer or what you are to say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>One of the multitude said to him, "Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or divider over you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, "Take heed, and beware of all covetousness; for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he told them a parable, saying, "The land of a rich man brought forth plentifully;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he thought to himself, `What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, `I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, `Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat, nor about your body, what you shall put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his span of life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O men of little faith!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be of anxious mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all the nations of the world seek these things; and your Father knows that you need them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things shall be yours as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide yourselves with purses that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast, so that they may open to him at once when he comes and knocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes; truly, I say to you, he will gird himself and have them sit at table, and he will come and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those servants!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But know this, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an unexpected hour."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that servant says to himself, `My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will punish him, and put him with the unfaithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that servant who knew his master's will, but did not make ready or act according to his will, shall receive a severe beating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, shall receive a light beating. Every one to whom much is given, of him will much be required; and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"I came to cast fire upon the earth; and would that it were already kindled!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how I am constrained until it is accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for henceforth in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>they will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against her mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He also said to the multitudes, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, `A shower is coming'; and so it happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, `There will be scorching heat'; and it happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky; but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>"And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell you, you will never get out till you have paid the very last copper."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
