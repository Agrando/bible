You shall be brought down to Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, "I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yea, Father, for such was thy gracious will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then turning to the disciples he said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to him, "You have answered right; do this, and you will live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, `Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Which of these three, do you think, proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He said, "The one who showed mercy on him." And Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now as they went on their way, he entered a village; and a woman named Martha received him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But the Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion, which shall not be taken away from her."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
