And he sought to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On their return the apostles told him what they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a city called Beth-sa'ida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and cured those who had need of healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, "Send the crowd away, to go into the villages and country round about, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a lonely place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish--unless we are to go and buy food for all these people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over, twelve baskets of broken pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now it happened that as he was praying alone the disciples were with him; and he asked them, "Who do the people say that I am?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they answered, "John the Baptist; but others say, Eli'jah; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>saying, "The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to all, "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as he was praying, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became dazzling white.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Eli'jah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, and when they wakened they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Eli'jah"--not knowing what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As he said this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silence and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And behold, a man from the crowd cried, "Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him till he foams, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>While he was coming, the demon tore him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And all were astonished at the majesty of God.  But while they were all marveling at everything he did, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And an argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But when Jesus perceived the thought of their hearts, he took a child and put him by his side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and said to them, "Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me; for he who is least among you all is the one who is great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>John answered, "Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus said to him, "Do not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>When the days drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>but the people would not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, "Lord, do you want us to bid fire come down from heaven and consume them?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he turned and rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they went on to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As they were going along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>To another he said, "Follow me." But he said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But he said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but let me first say farewell to those at my home."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus said to him, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
