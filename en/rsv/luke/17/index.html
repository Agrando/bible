And as they went they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Jesus, "Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, "Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor will they say, `Lo, here it is!' or `There!' for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to the disciples, "The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you, `Lo, there!' or `Lo, here!' Do not go, do not follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise as it was in the days of Lot--they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulphur rained from heaven and destroyed them all--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>so will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On that day, let him who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other left."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they said to him, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Where the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
