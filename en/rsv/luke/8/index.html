And the twelve were with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Mag'dalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and Joan'na, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell along the path, and was trodden under foot, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And some fell into good soil and grew, and yielded a hundredfold." As he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he said, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for others they are in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, that those who enter may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him for the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he was told, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he said to them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side of the lake." So they set out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said to them, "Where is your faith?" And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even wind and water, and they obey him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they arrived at the country of the Ger'asenes, which is opposite Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons; for a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but among the tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him; he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters, but he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the desert.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus then asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion"; for many demons had entered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them leave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And those who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Ger'asenes asked him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear; so he got into the boat and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but he sent him away, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you." And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And there came a man named Ja'irus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling at Jesus' feet he besought him to come to his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.  As he went, the people pressed round him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by any one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus said, "Who was it that touched me?" When all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But Jesus said, "Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he was still speaking, a man from the ruler's house came and said, "Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus on hearing this answered him, "Do not fear; only believe, and she shall be well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all were weeping and bewailing her; but he said, "Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But taking her by the hand he called, saying, "Child, arise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit returned, and she got up at once; and he directed that something should be given her to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were amazed; but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
