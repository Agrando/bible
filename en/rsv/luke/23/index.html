And he answered him, "You have said so."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no crime in this man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they were urgent, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will therefore chastise him and release him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But they all cried out together, "Away with this man, and release to us Barab'bas"--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but they shouted out, "Crucify, crucify him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A third time he said to them, "Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyre'ne, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus turning to them said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For behold, the days are coming when they will say, `Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us'; and to the hills, `Cover us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." And they cast lots to divide his garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>There was also an inscription over him, "This is the King of the Jews."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>while the sun's light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit!" And having said this he breathed his last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, and said, "Certainly this man was innocent!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathe'a. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>who had not consented to their purpose and deed, and he was looking for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.  On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
