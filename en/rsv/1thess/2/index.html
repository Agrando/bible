But God's wrath has come upon them at last!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But since we were bereft of you, brethren, for a short time, in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because we wanted to come to you--I, Paul, again and again--but Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
