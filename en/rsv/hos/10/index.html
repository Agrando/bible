The more his fruit increased the more altars he built; as his country improved he improved his pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Their heart is false; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars, and destroy their pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For now they will say: "We have no king, for we fear not the LORD, and a king, what could he do for us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They utter mere words; with empty oaths they make covenants; so judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The inhabitants of Sama'ria tremble for the calf of Beth-a'ven. Its people shall mourn for it, and its idolatrous priests shall wail over it, over its glory which has departed from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yea, the thing itself shall be carried to Assyria, as tribute to the great king. E'phraim shall be put to shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his idol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Sama'ria's king shall perish, like a chip on the face of the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. Thorn and thistle shall grow up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>From the days of Gib'e-ah, you have sinned, O Israel; there they have continued. Shall not war overtake them in Gib'e-ah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I will come against the wayward people to chastise them; and nations shall be gathered against them when they are chastised for their double iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>E'phraim was a trained heifer that loved to thresh, and I spared her fair neck; but I will put E'phraim to the yoke, Judah must plow, Jacob must harrow for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap the fruit of steadfast love; break up your fallow ground, for it is the time to seek the LORD, that he may come and rain salvation upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You have plowed iniquity, you have reaped injustice, you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your chariots and in the multitude of your warriors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore the tumult of war shall arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-ar'bel on the day of battle; mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus it shall be done to you, O house of Israel, because of your great wickedness. In the storm the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
