They set up princes, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for their own destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have spurned your calf, O Sama'ria. My anger burns against them. How long will it be till they are pure</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in Israel?  A workman made it; it is not God. The calf of Sama'ria shall be broken to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.

Now he will remember their iniquity, and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his strongholds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
