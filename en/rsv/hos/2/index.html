For she said, `I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns; and I will build a wall against her, so that she cannot find her paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She shall pursue her lovers, but not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, `I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better with me then than now.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And she did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the wine, and the oil, and who lavished upon her silver and gold which they used for Ba'al.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my wine in its season; and I will take away my wool and my flax, which were to cover her nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one shall rescue her out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will put an end to all her mirth, her feasts, her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her appointed feasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she said, `These are my hire, which my lovers have given me.' I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will punish her for the feast days of the Ba'als when she burned incense to them and decked herself with her ring and jewelry, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there I will give her her vineyards, and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"And in that day, says the LORD, you will call me, `My husband,' and no longer will you call me, `My Ba'al.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will remove the names of the Ba'als from her mouth, and they shall be mentioned by name no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will make for you a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land; and I will make you lie down in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will betroth you to me for ever; I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you shall know the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"And in that day, says the LORD, I will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and I will sow him for myself in the land.
