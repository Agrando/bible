Exult not like the peoples; for you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved a harlot's hire upon all threshing floors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Threshing floor and winevat shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They shall not remain in the land of the LORD; but E'phraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They shall not pour libations of wine to the LORD; and they shall not please him with their sacrifices. Their bread shall be like mourners' bread; all who eat of it shall be defiled; for their bread shall be for their hunger only; it shall not come to the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>What will you do on the day of appointed festival, and on the day of the feast of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For behold, they are going to Assyria; Egypt shall gather them, Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their precious things of silver; thorns shall be in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The days of punishment have come, the days of recompense have come; Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad, because of your great iniquity and great hatred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The prophet is the watchman of E'phraim, the people of my God, yet a fowler's snare is on all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gib'e-ah: he will remember their iniquity, he will punish their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Like grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel. Like the first fruit on the fig tree, in its first season, I saw your fathers. But they came to Ba'al-pe'or, and consecrated themselves to Ba'al, and became detestable like the thing they loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>E'phraim's glory shall fly away like a bird--no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Even if they bring up children, I will bereave them till none is left. Woe to them when I depart from them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>E'phraim's sons, as I have seen, are destined for a prey; E'phraim must lead forth his sons to slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Give them, O LORD--what wilt thou give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Every evil of theirs is in Gilgal; there I began to hate them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no more; all their princes are rebels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>E'phraim is stricken, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit. Even though they bring forth, I will slay their beloved children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My God will cast them off, because they have not hearkened to him; they shall be wanderers among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
