Now their deeds encompass them, they are before my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>By their wickedness they make the king glad, and the princes by their treachery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They are all adulterers; they are like a heated oven, whose baker ceases to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>On the day of our king the princes became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For like an oven their hearts burn with intrigue; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen; and none of them calls upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>E'phraim mixes himself with the peoples; E'phraim is a cake not turned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Aliens devour his strength, and he knows it not; gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, and he knows it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The pride of Israel witnesses against him; yet they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him, for all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>E'phraim is like a dove, silly and without sense, calling to Egypt, going to Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As they go, I will spread over them my net; I will bring them down like birds of the air; I will chastise them for their wicked deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They do not cry to me from the heart, but they wail upon their beds; for grain and wine they gash themselves, they rebel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Although I trained and strengthened their arms, yet they devise evil against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They turn to Ba'al; they are like a treacherous bow, their princes shall fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
