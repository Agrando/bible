For the spirit of harlotry is within them, and they know not the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The pride of Israel testifies to his face; E'phraim shall stumble in his guilt; Judah also shall stumble with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>With their flocks and herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they will not find him; he has withdrawn from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have dealt faithlessly with the LORD; for they have borne alien children.
