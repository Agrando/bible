I said to them, "You are exacting interest, each from his brother." And I held a great assembly against them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and said to them, "We, as far as we are able, have bought back our Jewish brethren who have been sold to the nations; but you even sell your brethren that they may be sold to us!" They were silent, and could not find a word to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I said, "The thing that you are doing is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover I and my brethren and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us leave off this interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and the hundredth of money, grain, wine, and oil which you have been exacting of them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they said, "We will restore these and require nothing from them. We will do as you say." And I called the priests, and took an oath of them to do as they had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I also shook out my lap and said, "So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not perform this promise. So may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said "Amen" and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of Ar-ta-xerx'es the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brethren ate the food allowance of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens upon the people, and took from them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also held to the work on this wall, and acquired no land; and all my servants were gathered there for the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty men, Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations which were about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; fowls likewise were prepared for me, and every ten days skins of wine in abundance; yet with all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the servitude was heavy upon this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
