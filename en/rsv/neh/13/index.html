And after some time I asked leave of the king</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and came to Jerusalem, and I then discovered the evil that Eli'ashib had done for Tobi'ah, preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobi'ah out of the chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I gave orders and they cleansed the chambers; and I brought back thither the vessels of the house of God, with the cereal offering and the frankincense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each to his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I remonstrated with the officials and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" And I gathered them together and set them in their stations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemi'ah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedai'ah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur, son of Mattani'ah, for they were counted faithful; and their duty was to distribute to their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days I saw in Judah men treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on asses; and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them on the day when they sold food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men of Tyre also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of wares and sold them on the sabbath to the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I remonstrated with the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing which you are doing, profaning the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this evil on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When it began to be dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants over the gates, that no burden might be brought in on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I warned them and said to them, "Why do you lodge before the wall? If you do so again I will lay hands on you." From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of thy steadfast love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but the language of each people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I contended with them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair; and I made them take oath in the name of God, saying, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless foreign women made even him to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the sons of Jehoi'ada, the son of Eli'ashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of Sanbal'lat the Hor'onite; therefore I chased him from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and I provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
