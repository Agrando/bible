But they intended to do me harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they sent to me four times in this way and I answered them in the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the same way Sanbal'lat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In it was written, "It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall; and you wish to become their king, according to this report.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, `There is a king in Judah.' And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. So now come, and let us take counsel together."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I sent to him, saying, "No such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done." But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now when I went into the house of Shemai'ah the son of Delai'ah, son of Mehet'abel, who was shut up, he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you, at night they are coming to kill you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I said, "Should such a man as I flee? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live? I will not go in."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I understood, and saw that God had not sent him, but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobi'ah and Sanbal'lat had hired him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me an evil name, in order to taunt me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember Tobi'ah and Sanbal'lat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess No-adi'ah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobi'ah, and Tobi'ah's letters came to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecani'ah the son of Arah: and his son Jehoha'nan had taken the daughter of Meshul'lam the son of Berechi'ah as his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence, and reported my words to him. And Tobi'ah sent letters to make me afraid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
