Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the capital,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that Hana'ni, one of my brethren, came with certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that survived, who had escaped exile, and concerning Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said to me, "The survivors there in the province who escaped exile are in great trouble and shame; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When I heard these words I sat down and wept, and mourned for days; and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I said, "O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>let thy ear be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant which I now pray before thee day and night for the people of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father's house have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We have acted very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which thou didst command thy servant Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remember the word which thou didst command thy servant Moses, saying, `If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your dispersed be under the farthest skies, I will gather them thence and bring them to the place which I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name; and give success to thy servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man."  Now I was cupbearer to the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
