The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The LORD is a jealous God and avenging, the LORD is avenging and wrathful; the LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries and keeps wrath for his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The LORD is slow to anger and of great might, and the LORD will by no means clear the guilty.  His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, he dries up all the rivers; Bashan and Carmel wither, the bloom of Lebanon fades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The mountains quake before him, the hills melt; the earth is laid waste before him, the world and all that dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But with an overflowing flood he will make a full end of his adversaries, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What do you plot against the LORD? He will make a full end; he will not take vengeance twice on his foes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Like entangled thorns they are consumed, like dry stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Did one not come out from you, who plotted evil against the LORD, and counseled villainy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says the LORD, "Though they be strong and many, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now I will break his yoke from off you and will burst your bonds asunder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD has given commandment about you: "No more shall your name be perpetuated; from the house of your gods I will cut off the graven image and the molten image. I will make your grave, for you are vile."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good tidings, who proclaims peace! Keep your feasts, O Judah, fulfil your vows, for never again shall the wicked come against you, he is utterly cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
