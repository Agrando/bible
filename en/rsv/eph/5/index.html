He who loves his wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because we are members of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This mystery is a profound one, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>however, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
