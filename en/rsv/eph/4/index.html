do not let the sun go down on your anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and give no opportunity to the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his hands, so that he may be able to give to those in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for edifying, as fits the occasion, that it may impart grace to those who hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, with all malice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
