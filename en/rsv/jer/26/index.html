And all the people gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the priests and the prophets said to the princes and to all the people, "This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will repent of the evil which he has pronounced against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Micah of Mo'resheth prophesied in the days of Hezeki'ah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: `Thus says the LORD of hosts, Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezeki'ah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and did not the LORD repent of the evil which he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great evil upon ourselves."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uri'ah the son of Shemai'ah from Kir'iath-je'arim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when King Jehoi'akim, with all his warriors and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uri'ah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then King Jehoi'akim sent to Egypt certain men, Elna'than the son of Achbor and others with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they fetched Uri'ah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoi'akim, who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the hand of Ahi'kam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
