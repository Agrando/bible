Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to live there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then the sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow hard after you to Egypt; and there you shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; they shall have no remnant or survivor from the evil which I will bring upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt.

You shall see this place no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The LORD has said to you, O remnant of Judah, `Do not go to Egypt.' Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. For you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, `Pray for us to the LORD our God, and whatever the LORD our God says declare to us and we will do it.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything that he sent me to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
