We have no vineyard or field or seed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that Jon'adab our father commanded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, `Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chalde'ans and the army of the Syrians.' So we are living in Jerusalem."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The command which Jon'adab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept; and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, `Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and your fathers.' But you did not incline your ear or listen to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The sons of Jon'adab the son of Rechab have kept the command which their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing on Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But to the house of the Re'chabites Jeremiah said, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jon'adab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done all that he commanded you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jon'adab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
