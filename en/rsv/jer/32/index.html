Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"And I bought the field at An'athoth from Han'amel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neri'ah son of Mahsei'ah, in the presence of Han'amel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neri'ah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`Ah Lord GOD! It is thou who hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thy outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who showest steadfast love to thousands, but dost requite the guilt of fathers to their children after them, O great and mighty God whose name is the LORD of hosts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>great in counsel and mighty in deed; whose eyes are open to all the ways of men, rewarding every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who hast shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, and hast made thee a name, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou didst bring thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and thou gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey thy voice or walk in thy law; they did nothing of all thou didst command them to do. Therefore thou hast made all this evil come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chalde'ans who are fighting against it. What thou didst speak has come to pass, and behold, thou seest it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet thou, O Lord GOD, hast said to me, "Buy the field for money and get witnesses"--though the city is given into the hands of the Chalde'ans.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too hard for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chalde'ans and into the hand of Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Chalde'ans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs incense has been offered to Ba'al and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; the sons of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they did to provoke me to anger--their kings and their princes, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They have turned to me their back and not their face; and though I have taught them persistently they have not listened to receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They set up their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They built the high places of Ba'al in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, `It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence':</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for their own good and the good of their children after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"For thus says the LORD: Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chalde'ans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephe'lah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes, says the LORD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
