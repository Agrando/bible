And behold, the waistcloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Thus says the LORD: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this waistcloth, which is good for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For as the waistcloth clings to the loins of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, says the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"You shall speak to them this word: `Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Every jar shall be filled with wine."' And they will say to you, `Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then you shall say to them, `Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, says the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hear and give ear; be not proud, for the LORD has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the twilight mountains, and while you look for light he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock has been taken captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Say to the king and the queen mother: "Take a lowly seat, for your beautiful crown has come down from your head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The cities of the Negeb are shut up, with none to open them; all Judah is taken into exile, wholly taken into exile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you? Will not pangs take hold of you, like those of a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if you say in your heart, `Why have these things come upon me?' it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up, and you suffer violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you, says the LORD, because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen your abominations, your adulteries and neighings, your lewd harlotries, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will it be before you are made clean?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
