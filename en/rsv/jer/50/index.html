Her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"For out of the north a nation has come up against her, which shall make her land a desolation, and none shall dwell in it; both man and beast shall flee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"In those days and in that time, says the LORD, the people of Israel and the people of Judah shall come together, weeping as they come; and they shall seek the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They shall ask the way to Zion, with faces turned toward it, saying, `Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant which will never be forgotten.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray, turning them away on the mountains; from mountain to hill they have gone, they have forgotten their fold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All who found them have devoured them, and their enemies have said, `We are not guilty, for they have sinned against the LORD, their true habitation, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Flee from the midst of Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chalde'ans, and be as he-goats before the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For behold, I am stirring up and bringing against Babylon a company of great nations, from the north country; and they shall array themselves against her; from there she shall be taken. Their arrows are like a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Chalde'a shall be plundered; all who plunder her shall be sated, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Though you rejoice, though you exult, O plunderers of my heritage, though you are wanton as a heifer at grass, and neigh like stallions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>your mother shall be utterly shamed, and she who bore you shall be disgraced. Lo, she shall be the last of the nations, a wilderness dry and desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because of the wrath of the LORD she shall not be inhabited, but shall be an utter desolation; every one who passes by Babylon shall be appalled, and hiss because of all her wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all you that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Raise a shout against her round about, she has surrendered; her bulwarks have fallen, her walls are thrown down. For this is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance on her, do to her as she has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the one who handles the sickle in time of harvest; because of the sword of the oppressor, every one shall turn to his own people, and every one shall flee to his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Israel is a hunted sheep driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and now at last Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon has gnawed his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing punishment on the king of Babylon and his land, as I punished the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and in Bashan, and his desire shall be satisfied on the hills of E'phraim and in Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In those days and in that time, says the LORD, iniquity shall be sought in Israel, and there shall be none; and sin in Judah, and none shall be found; for I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Go up against the land of Meratha'im, and against the inhabitants of Pekod. Slay, and utterly destroy after them, says the LORD, and do all that I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The noise of battle is in the land, and great destruction!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and broken! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I set a snare for you and you were taken, O Babylon, and you did not know it; you were found and caught, because you strove against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The LORD has opened his armory, and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Lord GOD of hosts has a work to do in the land of the Chalde'ans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Come against her from every quarter; open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain, and destroy her utterly; let nothing be left of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Slay all her bulls, let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come, the time of their punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Hark! they flee and escape from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, vengeance for his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Summon archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp round about her; let no one escape. Requite her according to her deeds, do to her according to all that she has done; for she has proudly defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed on that day, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Behold, I am against you, O proud one, says the Lord GOD of hosts; for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The proud one shall stumble and fall, with none to raise him up, and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will devour all that is round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Thus says the LORD of hosts: The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah with them; all who took them captive have held them fast, they refuse to let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name. He will surely plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"A sword upon the Chalde'ans, says the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes and her wise men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A sword upon the diviners, that they may become fools! A sword upon her warriors, that they may be destroyed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A sword upon her horses and upon her chariots, and upon all the foreign troops in her midst, that they may become women! A sword upon all her treasures, that they may be plundered!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A drought upon her waters, that they may be dried up! For it is a land of images, and they are mad over idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"Therefore wild beasts shall dwell with hyenas in Babylon, and ostriches shall dwell in her; she shall be peopled no more for ever, nor inhabited for all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomor'rah and their neighbor cities, says the LORD, so no man shall dwell there, and no son of man shall sojourn in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Behold, a people comes from the north; a mighty nation and many kings are stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They lay hold of bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy. The sound of them is like the roaring of the sea; they ride upon horses, arrayed as a man for battle against you, O daughter of Babylon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"The king of Babylon heard the report of them, and his hands fell helpless; anguish seized him, pain as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Behold, like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan against a strong sheepfold, I will suddenly make them run away from her; and I will appoint over her whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who will summon me? What shepherd can stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore hear the plan which the LORD has made against Babylon, and the purposes which he has formed against the land of the Chalde'ans: Surely the little ones of their flock shall be dragged away; surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth shall tremble, and her cry shall be heard among the nations."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
