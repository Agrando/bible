So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may perform the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day." Then I answered, "So be it, LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but every one walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Again the LORD said to me, "There is revolt among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, thus says the LORD, Behold, I am bringing evil upon them which they cannot escape; though they cry to me, I will not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to burn incense to Ba'al.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done vile deeds? Can vows and sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The LORD once called you, `A green olive tree, fair with goodly fruit'; but with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil which the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by burning incense to Ba'al."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The LORD made it known to me and I knew; then thou didst show me their evil deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter. I did not know it was against me they devised schemes, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O LORD of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance upon them, for to thee have I committed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of An'athoth, who seek your life, and say, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand"--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: "Behold, I will punish them; the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and none of them shall be left. For I will bring evil upon the men of An'athoth, the year of their punishment."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
