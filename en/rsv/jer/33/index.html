For I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Thus says the LORD of hosts: In this place which is waste, without man or beast, and in all of its cities, there shall again be habitations of shepherds resting their flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephe'lah, and in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will fulfil the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring forth for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: `The LORD is our righteousness.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"For thus says the LORD: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn cereal offerings, and to make sacrifices for ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Thus says the LORD: If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night will not come at their appointed time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David my servant, and the Levitical priests who minister to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Have you not observed what these people are saying, `The LORD has rejected the two families which he chose'? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus says the LORD: If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the ordinances of heaven and earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his descendants to rule over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes, and will have mercy upon them."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
