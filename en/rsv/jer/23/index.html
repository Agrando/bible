Behold, I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: `The LORD is our righteousness.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when men shall no longer say, `As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but `As the LORD lives who brought up and led the descendants of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.' Then they shall dwell in their own land."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and because of his holy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Both prophet and priest are ungodly; even in my house I have found their wickedness, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths in the darkness, into which they shall be driven and fall; for I will bring evil upon them in the year of their punishment, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the prophets of Sama'ria I saw an unsavory thing: they prophesied by Ba'al and led my people Israel astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his wickedness; all of them have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomor'rah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: "Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and give them poisoned water to drink; for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone forth into all the land."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes; they speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, `It shall be well with you'; and to every one who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, `No evil shall come upon you.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD to perceive and to hear his word, or who has given heed to his word and listened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his mind. In the latter days you will understand it clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Am I a God at hand, says the LORD, and not a God afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? says the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, `I have dreamed, I have dreamed!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams which they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Ba'al?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is not my word like fire, says the LORD, and like a hammer which breaks the rock in pieces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, who steal my words from one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, who use their tongues and say, `Says the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says the LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them; so they do not profit this people at all, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"When one of this people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, `What is the burden of the LORD?' you shall say to them, `You are the burden, and I will cast you off, says the LORD.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, `The burden of the LORD,' I will punish that man and his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, `What has the LORD answered?' or `What has the LORD spoken?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But `the burden of the LORD' you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus you shall say to the prophet, `What has the LORD answered you?' or `What has the LORD spoken?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if you say, `The burden of the LORD,' thus says the LORD, `Because you have said these words, "The burden of the LORD," when I sent to you, saying, "You shall not say, `The burden of the LORD,'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city which I gave to you and your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
