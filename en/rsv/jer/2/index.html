All who ate of it became guilty; evil came upon them, says the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the LORD: "What wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me, and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They did not say, `Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that none passes through, where no man dwells?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its good things. But when you came in you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The priests did not say, `Where is the LORD?' Those who handle the law did not know me; the rulers transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Ba'al, and went after things that do not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Therefore I still contend with you, says the LORD, and with your children's children I will contend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see, or send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has been such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? Why then has he become a prey?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The lions have roared against him, they have roared loudly. They have made his land a waste; his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, the men of Memphis and Tah'panhes have broken the crown of your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God, when he led you in the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria, to drink the waters of the Euphra'tes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your wickedness will chasten you, and your apostasy will reprove you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the LORD your God; the fear of me is not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"For long ago you broke your yoke and burst your bonds; and you said, `I will not serve.' Yea, upon every high hill and under every green tree you bowed down as a harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How can you say, `I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Ba'als'? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done--a restive young camel interlacing her tracks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>a wild ass used to the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind! Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, `It is hopeless, for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed: they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who say to a tree, `You are my father,' and to a stone, `You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they say, `Arise and save us!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you, in your time of trouble; for as many as your cities are your gods, O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Why do you complain against me? You have all rebelled against me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In vain have I smitten your children, they took no correction; your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you, O generation, heed the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my people say, `We are free, we will come no more to thee'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can a maiden forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"How well you direct your course to seek lovers! So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of guiltless poor; you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>you say, `I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.' Behold, I will bring you to judgment for saying, `I have not sinned.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>How lightly you gad about, changing your way! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>From it too you will come away with your hands upon your head, for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
