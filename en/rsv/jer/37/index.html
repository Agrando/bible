But Iri'jah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the princes were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells, and remained there many days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>King Zedeki'ah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" Jeremiah said, "There is." Then he said, "You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jeremiah also said to King Zedeki'ah, "What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, `The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now hear, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you, and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So King Zedeki'ah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
