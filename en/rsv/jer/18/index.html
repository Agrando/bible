Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will repent of the good which I had intended to do to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: `Thus says the LORD, Behold, I am shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"But they say, `That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Therefore thus says the LORD: Ask among the nations, who has heard the like of this? The virgin Israel has done a very horrible thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does the snow of Lebanon leave the crags of Si'rion? Do the mountain waters run dry, the cold flowing streams?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But my people have forgotten me, they burn incense to false gods; they have stumbled in their ways, in the ancient roads, and have gone into bypaths, not the highway,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>making their land a horror, a thing to be hissed at for ever. Every one who passes by it is horrified and shakes his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Like the east wind I will scatter them before the enemy. I will show them my back, not my face, in the day of their calamity."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they said, "Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not heed any of his words."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to my plea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Is evil a recompense for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore deliver up their children to famine; give them over to the power of the sword, let their wives become childless and widowed. May their men meet death by pestilence, their youths be slain by the sword in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>May a cry be heard from their houses, when thou bringest the marauder suddenly upon them! For they have dug a pit to take me, and laid snares for my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet, thou, O LORD, knowest all their plotting to slay me. Forgive not their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from thy sight. Let them be overthrown before thee; deal with them in the time of thine anger.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
