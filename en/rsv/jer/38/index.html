For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>King Zedeki'ah said, "Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchi'ah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When E'bed-mel'ech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern--the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>E'bed-mel'ech went from the king's house and said to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern; and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king commanded E'bed-mel'ech, the Ethiopian, "Take three men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So E'bed-mel'ech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe of the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then E'bed-mel'ech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes." Jeremiah did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>King Zedeki'ah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, "I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jeremiah said to Zedeki'ah, "If I tell you, will you not be sure to put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then King Zedeki'ah swore secretly to Jeremiah, "As the LORD lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jeremiah said to Zedeki'ah, "Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If you will surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you do not surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chalde'ans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>King Zedeki'ah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chalde'ans, lest I be handed over to them and they abuse me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jeremiah said, "You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the princes of the king of Babylon and were saying, `Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you; now that your feet are sunk in the mire, they turn away from you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chalde'ans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon; and this city shall be burned with fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Zedeki'ah said to Jeremiah, "Let no one know of these words and you shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If the princes hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, `Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then you shall say to them, `I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they left off speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
