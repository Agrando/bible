Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Alas! that day is so great there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And it shall come to pass in that day, says the LORD of hosts, that I will break the yoke from off their neck, and I will burst their bonds, and strangers shall no more make servants of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, says the LORD, nor be dismayed, O Israel; for lo, I will save you from afar, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and none shall make him afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am with you to save you, says the LORD; I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you, but of you I will not make a full end. I will chasten you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"For thus says the LORD: Your hurt is incurable, and your wound is grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is none to uphold your cause, no medicine for your wound, no healing for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All your lovers have forgotten you; they care nothing for you; for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy, the punishment of a merciless foe, because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why do you cry out over your hurt? Your pain is incurable. Because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant, I have done these things to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity; those who despoil you shall become a spoil, and all who prey on you I will make a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, says the LORD, because they have called you an outcast: `It is Zion, for whom no one cares!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob, and have compassion on his dwellings; the city shall be rebuilt upon its mound, and the palace shall stand where it used to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving, and the voices of those who make merry. I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will make them honored, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their children shall be as they were of old, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Their prince shall be one of themselves, their ruler shall come forth from their midst; I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me, for who would dare of himself to approach me? says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall be my people, and I will be your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his mind. In the latter days you will understand this.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
