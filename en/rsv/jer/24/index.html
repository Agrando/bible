I said, "Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chalde'ans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land.
