Blow the trumpet in Teko'a, and raise a signal on Beth-hacche'rem; for evil looms out of the north, and great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The comely and delicately bred I will destroy, the daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her; they shall pitch their tents around her, they shall pasture, each in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Prepare war against her; up, and let us attack at noon!" "Woe to us, for the day declines, for the shadows of evening lengthen!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Up, and let us attack by night, and destroy her palaces!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus says the LORD of hosts: "Hew down her trees; cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem. This is the city which must be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As a well keeps its water fresh, so she keeps fresh her wickedness; violence and destruction are heard within her; sickness and wounds are ever before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be warned, O Jerusalem, lest I be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel; like a grape-gatherer pass your hand again over its branches."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are closed, they cannot listen; behold, the word of the LORD is to them an object of scorn, they take no pleasure in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary of holding it in. "Pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the gatherings of young men, also; both husband and wife shall be taken, the old folk and the very aged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land," says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"For from the least to the greatest of them, every one is greedy for unjust gain; and from prophet to priest, every one deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, `Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown," says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says the LORD: "Stand by the roads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, `We will not walk in it.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I set watchmen over you, saying, `Give heed to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, `We will not give heed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O congregation, what will happen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, O earth; behold, I am bringing evil upon this people, the fruit of their devices, because they have not given heed to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To what purpose does frankincense come to me from Sheba, or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says the LORD: `Behold, I will lay before this people stumbling blocks against which they shall stumble; fathers and sons together, neighbor and friend shall perish.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the LORD: "Behold, a people is coming from the north country, a great nation is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They lay hold on bow and spear, they are cruel and have no mercy, the sound of them is like the roaring sea; they ride upon horses, set in array as a man for battle, against you, O daughter of Zion!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard the report of it, our hands fall helpless; anguish has taken hold of us, pain as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Go not forth into the field, nor walk on the road; for the enemy has a sword, terror is on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth, and roll in ashes; make mourning as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"I have made you an assayer and tester among my people, that you may know and assay their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They are all stubbornly rebellious, going about with slanders; they are bronze and iron, all of them act corruptly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows blow fiercely, the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain the refining goes on, for the wicked are not removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Refuse silver they are called, for the LORD has rejected them."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
