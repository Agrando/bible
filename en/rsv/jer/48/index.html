Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Woe to Nebo, for it is laid waste! Kiriatha'im is put to shame, it is taken; the fortress is put to shame and broken down;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>the renown of Moab is no more. In Heshbon they planned evil against her: `Come, let us cut her off from being a nation!' You also, O Madmen, shall be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Hark! a cry from Horona'im, `Desolation and great destruction!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moab is destroyed; a cry is heard as far as Zo'ar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping; for at the descent of Horona'im they have heard the cry of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee! Save yourselves! Be like a wild ass in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For, because you trusted in your strongholds and your treasures, you also shall be taken; and Chemosh shall go forth into exile, with his priests and his princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The destroyer shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Give wings to Moab, for she would fly away; her cities shall become a desolation, with no inhabitant in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Cursed is he who does the work of the LORD with slackness; and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Moab has been at ease from his youth and has settled on his lees; he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into exile; so his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I shall send to him tilters who will tilt him, and empty his vessels, and break his jars in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"How do you say, `We are heroes and mighty men of war'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The destroyer of Moab and his cities has come up, and the choicest of his young men have gone down to slaughter, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The calamity of Moab is near at hand and his affliction hastens apace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Bemoan him, all you who are round about him, and all who know his name; say, `How the mighty scepter is broken, the glorious staff.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Come down from your glory, and sit on the parched ground, O inhabitant of Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you; he has destroyed your strongholds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Stand by the way and watch, O inhabitant of Aro'er! Ask him who flees and her who escapes; say, `What has happened?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moab is put to shame, for it is broken; wail and cry! Tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Judgment has come upon the tableland, upon Holon, and Jahzah, and Meph'a-ath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Dibon, and Nebo, and Beth-diblatha'im,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Kiriatha'im, and Beth-ga'mul, and Beth-me'on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Ker'i-oth, and Bozrah, and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against the LORD; so that Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he too shall be held in derision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Was not Israel a derision to you? Was he found among thieves, that whenever you spoke of him you wagged your head?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, O inhabitants of Moab! Be like the dove that nests in the sides of the mouth of a gorge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We have heard of the pride of Moab--he is very proud--of his loftiness, his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I know his insolence, says the LORD; his boasts are false, his deeds are false.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I wail for Moab; I cry out for all Moab; for the men of Kir-he'res I mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>More than for Jazer I weep for you, O vine of Sibmah! Your branches passed over the sea, reached as far as Jazer; upon your summer fruits and your vintage the destroyer has fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Gladness and joy have been taken away from the fruitful land of Moab; I have made the wine cease from the wine presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy; the shouting is not the shout of joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Heshbon and Ele-a'leh cry out; as far as Jahaz they utter their voice, from Zo'ar to Horona'im and Eg'lath-shelish'iyah. For the waters of Nimrim also have become desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will bring to an end in Moab, says the LORD, him who offers sacrifice in the high place and burns incense to his god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute, and my heart moans like a flute for the men of Kir-he'res; therefore the riches they gained have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"For every head is shaved and every beard cut off; upon all the hands are gashes, and on the loins is sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing but lamentation; for I have broken Moab like a vessel for which no one cares, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>How it is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a horror to all that are round about him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thus says the LORD: "Behold, one shall fly swiftly like an eagle, and spread his wings against Moab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>the cities shall be taken and the strongholds seized. The heart of the warriors of Moab shall be in that day like the heart of a woman in her pangs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Moab shall be destroyed and be no longer a people, because he magnified himself against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Terror, pit, and snare are before you, O inhabitant of Moab! says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he who climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their punishment, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"In the shadow of Heshbon fugitives stop without strength; for a fire has gone forth from Heshbon, a flame from the house of Sihon; it has destroyed the forehead of Moab, the crown of the sons of tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days, says the LORD." Thus far is the judgment on Moab.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
