Thus says the LORD concerning you: `You shall not die by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so men shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, "Alas, lord!"' For I have spoken the word, says the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedeki'ah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Aze'kah; for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedeki'ah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that every one should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they obeyed, all the princes and all the people who had entered into the covenant that every one would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again; they obeyed and set them free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`At the end of six years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.' But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, says the LORD. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before me, I will make like the calf which they cut in two and passed between its parts--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Zedeki'ah king of Judah, and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I will command, says the LORD, and will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
