Yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says the LORD concerning this people: "They have loved to wander thus, they have not restrained their feet; therefore the LORD does not accept them, now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The LORD said to me: "Do not pray for the welfare of this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they offer burnt offering and cereal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I said: "Ah, Lord GOD, behold, the prophets say to them, `You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD said to me: "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name; I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although I did not send them, and who say, `Sword and famine shall not come on this land': By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, with none to bury them--them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their wickedness upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"You shall say to them this word: `Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people is smitten with a great wound, with a very grievous blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go out into the field, behold, those slain by the sword! And if I enter the city, behold, the diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land, and have no knowledge.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? Does thy soul loathe Zion? Why hast thou smitten us so that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD, and the iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not spurn us, for thy name's sake; do not dishonor thy glorious throne; remember and do not break thy covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the false gods of the nations that can bring rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Art thou not he, O LORD our God? We set our hope on thee, for thou doest all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
