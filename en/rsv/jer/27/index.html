Why should this city become a desolation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, then let them intercede with the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels which are left in this city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>which Nebuchadnez'zar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconi'ah the son of Jehoi'akim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I give attention to them, says the LORD.
