Eat, O friends, and drink: drink deeply, O lovers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I slept, but my heart was awake. Hark! my beloved is knocking. "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I had put off my garment, how could I put it on? I had bathed my feet, how could I soil them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My beloved put his hand to the latch, and my heart was thrilled within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The watchmen found me, as they went about in the city; they beat me, they wounded me, they took away my mantle, those watchmen of the walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am sick with love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What is your beloved more than another beloved, O fairest among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you thus adjure us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My beloved is all radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are like doves beside springs of water, bathed in milk, fitly set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His cheeks are like beds of spices, yielding fragrance. His lips are lilies, distilling liquid myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His arms are rounded gold, set with jewels. His body is ivory work, encrusted with sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His legs are alabaster columns, set upon bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His speech is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
