If I met you outside, I would kiss you, and none would despise me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother, and into the chamber of her that conceived me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>O that his left hand were under my head, and that his right hand embraced me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up nor awaken love until it please.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in travail with you, there she who bore you was in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a most vehement flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, it would be utterly scorned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We have a little sister, and she has no breasts.
