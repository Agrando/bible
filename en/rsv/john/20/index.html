She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?" Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rab-bo'ni!" (which means Teacher).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to her, "Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Mag'dalene went and said to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord"; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, "Peace be with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but believing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
