He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, `Show us the Father'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if you ask anything in my name, I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"If you love me, you will keep my commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you for ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him, for he dwells with you, and will be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more, but you will see me; because I live, you will live also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who does not love me does not keep my words; and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"These things I have spoken to you, while I am still with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You heard me say to you, `I go away, and I will come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go hence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
