Now that day was the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the Jews said to the man who was cured, "It is the sabbath, it is not lawful for you to carry your pallet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But he answered them, "The man who healed me said to me, `Take up your pallet, and walk.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, `Take up your pallet, and walk'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse befall you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this was why the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did this on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working still, and I am working."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was why the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, that the Son does likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself is doing; and greater works than these will he show him, that you may marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; he does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"I can do nothing on my own authority; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I bear witness to myself, my testimony is not true;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>there is another who bears witness to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has granted me to accomplish, these very works which I am doing, bear me witness that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness to me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>You search the scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I do not receive glory from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But I know that you have not the love of God within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How can you believe, who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
