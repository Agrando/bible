If you do these things, show yourself to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even his brothers did not believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So saying, he remained in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, "Where is he?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, "He is a good man," others said, "No, he is leading the people astray."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews marveled at it, saying, "How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jesus answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>if any man's will is to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered, "You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered them, "I did one deed, and you all marvel at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, "Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, "You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they sought to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet many of the people believed in him; they said, "When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the crowd thus muttering about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus then said, "I shall be with you a little longer, and then I go to him who sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>you will seek me and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What does he mean by saying, `You will seek me and you will not find me,' and, `Where I am you cannot come'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and proclaimed, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, `Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When they heard these words, some of the people said, "This is really the prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "Is the Christ to come from Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has not the scripture said that the Christ is descended from David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division among the people over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why did you not bring him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees answered them, "Are you led astray, you also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this crowd, who do not know the law, are accursed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicode'mus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They replied, "Are you from Galilee too? Search and you will see that no prophet is to rise from Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They went each to his own house,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
