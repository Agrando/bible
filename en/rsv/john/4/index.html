It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There came a woman of Samar'ia to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samar'ia?" For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, `Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; where do you get that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus said to her, "Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered him, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You are right in saying, `I have no husband';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband; this you said truly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ); when he comes, he will show us all things."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am he."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Just then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but none said, "What do you wish?" or, "Why are you talking with her?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They went out of the city and were coming to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Meanwhile the disciples besought him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So the disciples said to one another, "Has any one brought him food?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, `There are yet four months, then comes the harvest'? I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see how the fields are already white for harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For here the saying holds true, `One sows and another reaps.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me all that I ever did."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed because of his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They said to the woman, "It is no longer because of your words that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After the two days he departed to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Caper'na-um there was an official whose son was ill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, "Go; your son will live." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>So he asked them the hour when he began to mend, and they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live"; and he himself believed, and all his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
