Pilate said to them, "Behold the man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he has made himself the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pilate therefore said to him, "You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered him, "You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, "If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend; every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gab'batha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They cried out, "Away with him, away with him, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Gol'gotha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, "Do not write, `The King of the Jews,' but, `This man said, I am King of the Jews.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be." This was to fulfil the scripture, "They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Mag'dalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the scripture), "I thirst."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished"; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He who saw it has borne witness--his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth--that you also may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, "Not a bone of him shall be broken."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another scripture says, "They shall look on him whom they have pierced."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After this Joseph of Arimathe'a, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took away his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nicode'mus also, who had at first come to him by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds' weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
