The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who is a hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this charge I have received from my Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said, "He has a demon, and he is mad; why listen to him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, "These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It was the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, "It is not for a good work that we stone you but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, `I said, you are gods'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and scripture cannot be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, `You are blaspheming,' because I said, `I am the Son of God'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again they tried to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John at first baptized, and there he remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to him; and they said, "John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
