Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" And he answered, "No."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said to him then, "Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They asked him, "Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, "I baptize with water; but among you stands one whom you do not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>even he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, `After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John bore witness, "I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I myself did not know him; but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, `He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What do you seek?" And they said to him, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He said to them, "Come and see." They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas" (which means Peter).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was from Beth-sa'ida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip found Nathan'a-el, and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Nathan'a-el said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathan'a-el coming to him, and said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathan'a-el said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathan'a-el answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
