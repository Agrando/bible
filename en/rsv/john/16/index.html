"I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, `Where are you going?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he comes, he will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little while, and you will see me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Some of his disciples said to one another, "What is this that he says to us, `A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me'; and, `because I go to the Father'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said, "What does he mean by `a little while'? We do not know what he means."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; so he said to them, "Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, `A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When a woman is in travail she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"I have said this to you in figures; the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures but tell you plainly of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said, "Ah, now you are speaking plainly, not in any figure!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that you know all things, and need none to question you; by this we believe that you came from God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, every man to his home, and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
