Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, "Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, "This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Caper'na-um. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat. They were frightened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but he said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>However, boats from Tiber'i-as came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Caper'na-um, seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they said to him, "What must we do, to be doing the works of God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they said to him, "Then what sign do you do, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you perform?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, `He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said to him, "Lord, give us this bread always."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, "I am the bread which came down from heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, `I have come down from heaven'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered them, "Do not murmur among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophets, `And they shall all be taught by God.' Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that any one has seen the Father except him who is from God; he has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread which came down from heaven, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live for ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This he said in the synagogue, as he taught at Caper'na-um.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, "This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, "Do you take offense at this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you that do not believe." For Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And he said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Jesus said to the twelve, "Do you also wish to go away?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was to betray him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
