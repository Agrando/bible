So he went and washed and came back seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, "It is he"; others said, "No, but he is like him." He said, "I am the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said to him, "Then how were your eyes opened?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, "The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, `Go to Silo'am and wash'; so I went and washed and received my sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They said to him, "Where is he?" He said, "I do not know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they again said to the blind man, "What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore his parents said, "He is of age, ask him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered, "Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, "I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they reviled him, saying, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered, "Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Never since the world began has it been heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered him, "You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?" And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, "Do you believe in the Son of man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered, "And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, "You have seen him, and it is he who speaks to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said, "Lord, I believe"; and he worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Some of the Pharisees near him heard this, and they said to him, "Are we also blind?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, `We see,' your guilt remains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
