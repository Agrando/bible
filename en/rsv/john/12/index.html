Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it; as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on an ass's colt!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that this had been written of him and had been done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The crowd that had been with him when he called Laz'arus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Pharisees then said to one another, "You see that you can do nothing; look, the world has gone after him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So these came to Philip, who was from Beth-sa'ida in Galilee, and said to him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any one serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me, the Father will honor him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? `Father, save me from this hour'? No, for this purpose I have come to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify thy name." Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered, "This voice has come for your sake, not for mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said this to show by what death he was to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them, "The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light."  When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>it was that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: "Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they could not believe. For Isaiah again said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their heart, and turn for me to heal them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he who sees me sees him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come as light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has bidden me."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
