Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not marvel that I said to you, `You must be born anew.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one who is born of the Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicode'mus said to him, "How can this be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered him, "Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that whoever believes in him may have eternal life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; there he remained with them and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>John also was baptizing at Ae'non near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John had not yet been put in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now a discussion arose between John's disciples and a Jew over purifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, here he is, baptizing, and all are going to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered, "No one can receive anything except what is given him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice; therefore this joy of mine is now full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must increase, but I must decrease."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks; he who comes from heaven is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he who receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for it is not by measure that he gives the Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
