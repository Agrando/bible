This is the spirit of antichrist, of which you heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Little children, you are of God, and have overcome them; for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are of the world, therefore what they say is of the world, and the world listens to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and he who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God, and he who loves is born of God and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who does not love does not know God; for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his own Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In this is love perfected with us, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and he who fears is not perfected in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love, because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If any one says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should love his brother also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
