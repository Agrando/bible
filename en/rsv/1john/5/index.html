And his commandments are not burdensome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has borne witness to his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne to his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any one sees his brother committing what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God will give him life for those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin which is mortal; I do not say that one is to pray for that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which is not mortal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that any one born of God does not sin, but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.
