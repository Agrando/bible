In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wish those who unsettle you would mutilate themselves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants of one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another take heed that you are not consumed by one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us have no self-conceit, no provoking of one another, no envy of one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
