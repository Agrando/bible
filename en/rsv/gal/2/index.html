Certainly not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if I build up again those things which I tore down, then I prove myself a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification were through the law, then Christ died to no purpose.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
