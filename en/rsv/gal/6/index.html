Look to yourself, lest you too be tempted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For if any one thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For each man will have to bear his own load.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let him who is taught the word share all good things with him who teaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that would compel you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For even those who receive circumcision do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule, upon the Israel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren.
