Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, so now I say again, If any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not man's gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and had called me through his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and remained with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cili'cia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I was still not known by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>they only heard it said, "He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God because of me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
