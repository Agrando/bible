Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Did you experience so many things in vain?--if it really is in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus Abraham "believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So you see that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you shall all the nations be blessed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then, those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, "Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law; for "He who through faith is righteous shall live";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but the law does not rest on faith, for "He who does them shall live by them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us--for it is written, "Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree"--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To give a human example, brethren: no one annuls even a man's will, or adds to it, once it has been ratified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, "And to offsprings," referring to many; but, referring to one, "And to your offspring," which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This is what I mean: the law, which came four hundred and thirty years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance is by the law, it is no longer by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made; and it was ordained by angels through an intermediary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now an intermediary implies more than one; but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not; for if a law had been given which could make alive, then righteousness would indeed be by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scripture consigned all things to sin, that what was promised to faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now before faith came, we were confined under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that the law was our custodian until Christ came, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
