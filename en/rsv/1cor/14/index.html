He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how shall I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will any one know what is played?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So with yourselves; if you in a tongue utter speech that is not intelligible, how will any one know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So with yourselves; since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the "Amen" to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you may give thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; be babes in evil, but in thinking be mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, "By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If, therefore, the whole church assembles and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What then, brethren? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silence in church and speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.  As in all the churches of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What! Did the word of God originate with you, or are you the only ones it has reached?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any one thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If any one does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So, my brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but all things should be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
