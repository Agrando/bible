I do not even judge myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then every man will receive his commendation from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have applied all this to myself and Apol'los for your benefit, brethren, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who sees anything different in you? What have you that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Already you are filled! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>when slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become, and are now, as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I do not write this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I urge you, then, be imitators of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I sent to you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
