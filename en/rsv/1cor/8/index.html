"Knowledge" puffs up, but love builds up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If any one imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But if one loves God, one is known by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that "an idol has no real existence," and that "there is no God but one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth--as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through being hitherto accustomed to idols, eat food as really offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Only take care lest this liberty of yours somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if any one sees you, a man of knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, might he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, if food is a cause of my brother's falling, I will never eat meat, lest I cause my brother to fall.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
