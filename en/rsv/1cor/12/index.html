If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as it is, God arranged the organs in the body, each one of them, as he chose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If all were a single organ, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the contrary, the parts of the body which seem to be weaker are indispensable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we invest with the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior part,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there may be no discord in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then healers, helpers, administrators, speakers in various kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But earnestly desire the higher gifts.  And I will show you a still more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
