Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Ga'ius;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest any one should say that you were baptized in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(I did baptize also the household of Steph'anas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any one else.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the cleverness of the clever I will thwart."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made our wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>therefore, as it is written, "Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
