For they drank from the supernatural Rock which followed them, and the Rock was Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Nevertheless with most of them God was not pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now these things are warnings for us, not to desire evil as they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to dance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We must not indulge in immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We must not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now these things happened to them as a warning, but they were written down for our instruction, upon whom the end of the ages has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore let any one who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, my beloved, shun the worship of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I speak as to sensible men; judge for yourselves what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Consider the people of Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"All things are lawful," but not all things are helpful. "All things are lawful," but not all things build up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For "the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>(But if some one says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then out of consideration for the man who informed you, and for conscience' sake--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I mean his conscience, not yours--do not eat it.) For why should my liberty be determined by another man's scruples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>just as I try to please all men in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
