On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God which is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"For God has put all things in subjection under his feet." But when it says, "All things are put in subjection under him," it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things under him, that God may be everything to every one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Why am I in peril every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Come to your right mind, and sin no more. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what you sow is not the body which is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For not all flesh is alike, but there is one kind for men, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are celestial bodies and there are terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thus it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But it is not the spiritual which is first but the physical, and then the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>I tell you this, brethren: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Lo! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this perishable nature must put on the imperishable, and this mortal nature must put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: "Death is swallowed up in victory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
