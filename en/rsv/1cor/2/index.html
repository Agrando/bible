For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For what person knows a man's thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who possess the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The spiritual man judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
