And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, matters pertaining to this life!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If then you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who are least esteemed by the church?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between members of the brotherhood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To have lawsuits at all with one another is defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you yourselves wrong and defraud, and that even your own brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"All things are lawful for me," but not all things are helpful. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be enslaved by anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food"--and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, "The two shall become one flesh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Shun immorality. Every other sin which a man commits is outside the body; but the immoral man sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God? You are not your own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
