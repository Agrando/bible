Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For though absent in body I am present in spirit, and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing. When you are assembled, and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our paschal lamb, has been sacrificed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let us, therefore, celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with immoral men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>not at all meaning the immoral of this world, or the greedy and robbers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But rather I wrote to you not to associate with any one who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or robber--not even to eat with such a one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For what have I to do with judging outsiders?
