He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by your instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you have not kept my ways but have shown partiality in your instruction."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob, for the man who does this, any to witness or answer, or to bring an offering to the LORD of hosts!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this again you do. You cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You ask, "Why does he not?" Because the LORD was witness to the covenant between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Has not the one God made and sustained for us the spirit of life? And what does he desire? Godly offspring. So take heed to yourselves, and let none be faithless to the wife of his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"For I hate divorce, says the LORD the God of Israel, and covering one's garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So take heed to yourselves and do not be faithless."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, "How have we wearied him?" By saying, "Every one who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them." Or by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
