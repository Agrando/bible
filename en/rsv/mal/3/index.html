"For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, till they present right offerings to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Then I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, `How shall we return?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me.

In your tithes and offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me; the whole nation of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Bring the full tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house; and thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you an overflowing blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil; and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Your words have been stout against me, says the LORD. Yet you say, `How have we spoken against thee?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You have said, `It is vain to serve God.
