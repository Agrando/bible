But you say, "How hast thou loved us?" "Is not Esau Jacob's brother?" says the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but I have hated Esau; I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If Edom says, "We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins," the LORD of hosts says, "They may build, but I will tear down, till they are called the wicked country, the people with whom the LORD is angry for ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, "Great is the LORD, beyond the border of Israel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. You say, `How have we despised thy name?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By offering polluted food upon my altar. And you say, `How have we polluted it?' By thinking that the LORD's table may be despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that no evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that no evil? Present that to your governor; will he be pleased with you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Oh, that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire upon my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name is great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But you profane it when you say that the LORD's table is polluted, and the food for it may be despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`What a weariness this is,' you say, and you sniff at me, says the LORD of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished; for I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name is feared among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
