Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will requite your deed upon your own head swiftly and speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, removing them far from their own border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But now I will stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will requite your deed upon your own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabe'ans, to a nation far off; for the LORD has spoken."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war, stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, "I am a warrior."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Hasten and come, all you nations round about, gather yourselves there. Bring down thy warriors, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehosh'aphat; for there I will sit to judge all the nations round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the wine press is full. The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shake. But the LORD is a refuge to his people, a stronghold to the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who dwell in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall never again pass through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And in that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the stream beds of Judah shall flow with water; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD and water the valley of Shittim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Egypt shall become a desolation and Edom a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the people of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Judah shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem to all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will avenge their blood, and I will not clear the guilty, for the LORD dwells in Zion."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
