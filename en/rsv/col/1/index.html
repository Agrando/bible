Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing--so among yourselves, from the day you heard and understood the grace of God in truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>as you learned it from Ep'aphras our beloved fellow servant.
