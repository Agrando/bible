And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>David said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David said to him, "How did it go? Tell me." And he answered, "The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man who told him said, "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilbo'a; and there was Saul leaning upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, `Here I am.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to me, `Who are you?' I answered him, `I am an Amal'ekite.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, `Stand beside me and slay me; for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen; and I took the crown which was on his head and the armlet which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David took hold of his clothes, and rent them; and so did all the men who were with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to the young man who told him, "Where do you come from?" And he answered, "I am the son of a sojourner, an Amal'ekite."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David said to him, "How is it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then David called one of the young men and said, "Go, fall upon him." And he smote him so that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said to him, "Your blood be upon your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, `I have slain the LORD'S anointed.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. He said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ash'kelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Ye mountains of Gilbo'a, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor upsurging of the deep! For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you daintily in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!  "Jonathan lies slain upon thy high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant have you been to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
