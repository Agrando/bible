These were born to David in Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Ai'ah; and Ish-bo'sheth said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bo'sheth, and said, "Am I a dog's head of Judah? This day I keep showing loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the LORD has sworn to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Ish-bo'sheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Abner sent messengers to David at Hebron, saying, "To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, "Good; I will make a covenant with you; but one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then David sent messengers to Ish-bo'sheth Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed at the price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Ish-bo'sheth sent, and took her from her husband Pal'ti-el the son of La'ish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahu'rim. Then Abner said to him, "Go, return"; and he returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, "For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now then bring it about; for the LORD has promised David, saying, `By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Abner also spoke to Benjamin; and then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abner said to David, "I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Just then the servants of David arrived with Jo'ab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When Jo'ab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Jo'ab, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jo'ab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Jo'ab came out from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah; but David did not know about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Abner returned to Hebron, Jo'ab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he smote him in the belly, so that he died, for the blood of As'ahel his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, "I and my kingdom are for ever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>May it fall upon the head of Jo'ab, and upon all his father's house; and may the house of Jo'ab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is leprous, or who holds a spindle, or who is slain by the sword, or who lacks bread!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Jo'ab and Abi'shai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother As'ahel in the battle at Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then David said to Jo'ab and to all the people who were with him, "Rend your clothes, and gird on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner." And King David followed the bier.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They buried Abner at Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king lamented for Abner, saying, "Should Abner die as a fool dies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen." And all the people wept again over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, "God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as everything that the king did pleased all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king's will to slay Abner the son of Ner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; these men the sons of Zeru'iah are too hard for me. The LORD requite the evildoer according to his wickedness!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
