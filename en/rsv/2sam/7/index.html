When he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before me; your throne shall be established for ever.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and said, "Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And yet this was a small thing in thy eyes, O Lord GOD; thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast shown me future generations, O Lord GOD!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what more can David say to thee? For thou knowest thy servant, O Lord GOD!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because of thy promise, and according to thy own heart, thou hast wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thou art great, O LORD God; for there is none like thee, and there is no God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>What other nation on earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his people, making himself a name, and doing for them great and terrible things, by driving out before his people a nation and its gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And thou didst establish for thyself thy people Israel to be thy people for ever; and thou, O LORD, didst become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O LORD God, confirm for ever the word which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house, and do as thou hast spoken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and thy name will be magnified for ever, saying, `The LORD of hosts is God over Israel,' and the house of thy servant David will be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, hast made this revelation to thy servant, saying, `I will build you a house'; therefore thy servant has found courage to pray this prayer to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Lord GOD, thou art God, and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this good thing to thy servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>now therefore may it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken, and with thy blessing shall the house of thy servant be blessed for ever."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
