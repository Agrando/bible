But David remained at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking upon the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, "Is not this Bathshe'ba, the daughter of Eli'am, the wife of Uri'ah the Hittite?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, "I am with child."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So David sent word to Jo'ab, "Send me Uri'ah the Hittite." And Jo'ab sent Uri'ah to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When Uri'ah came to him, David asked how Jo'ab was doing, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then David said to Uri'ah, "Go down to your house, and wash your feet." And Uri'ah went out of the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Uri'ah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they told David, "Uri'ah did not go down to his house," David said to Uri'ah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Uri'ah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths; and my lord Jo'ab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field; shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then David said to Uri'ah, "Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart." So Uri'ah remained in Jerusalem that day, and the next.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the morning David wrote a letter to Jo'ab, and sent it by the hand of Uri'ah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the letter he wrote, "Set Uri'ah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as Jo'ab was besieging the city, he assigned Uri'ah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of the city came out and fought with Jo'ab; and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uri'ah the Hittite was slain also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jo'ab sent and told David all the news about the fighting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he instructed the messenger, "When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, `Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who killed Abim'elech the son of Jerub'besheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, `Your servant Uri'ah the Hittite is dead also.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Jo'ab had sent him to tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The messenger said to David, "The men gained an advantage over us, and came out against us in the field; but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall; some of the king's servants are dead; and your servant Uri'ah the Hittite is dead also."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>David said to the messenger, "Thus shall you say to Jo'ab, `Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours now one and now another; strengthen your attack upon the city, and overthrow it.' And encourage him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the wife of Uri'ah heard that Uri'ah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
