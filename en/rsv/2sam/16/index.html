Ziba answered, "The asses are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who faint in the wilderness to drink."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, "And where is your master's son?" Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, `Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belonged to Mephib'osheth is now yours." And Ziba said, "I do obeisance; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When King David came to Bahu'rim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shim'e-i, the son of Gera; and as he came he cursed continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Shim'e-i said as he cursed, "Begone, begone, you man of blood, you worthless fellow!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The LORD has avenged upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Ab'salom. See, your ruin is on you; for you are a man of blood."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abi'shai the son of Zeru'iah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeru'iah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, `Curse David,' who then shall say, `Why have you done so?'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David said to Abi'shai and to all his servants, "Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that the LORD will look upon my affliction, and that the LORD will repay me with good for this cursing of me today."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So David and his men went on the road, while Shim'e-i went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him and flung dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary at the Jordan; and there he refreshed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now Ab'salom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahith'ophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Ab'salom, Hushai said to Ab'salom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Ab'salom said to Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Hushai said to Ab'salom, "No; for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Ab'salom said to Ahith'ophel, "Give your counsel; what shall we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ahith'ophel said to Ab'salom, "Go in to your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they pitched a tent for Ab'salom upon the roof; and Ab'salom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now in those days the counsel which Ahith'ophel gave was as if one consulted the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of Ahith'ophel esteemed, both by David and by Ab'salom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
