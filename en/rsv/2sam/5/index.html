Therefore it is said, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built the city round about from the Millo inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Sham'mu-a, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ibhar, Eli'shu-a, Nepheg, Japhi'a,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Eli'shama, Eli'ada, and Eliph'elet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; but David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the valley of Reph'aim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into my hand?" And the LORD said to David, "Go up; for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David came to Ba'al-pera'zim, and David defeated them there; and he said, "The LORD has broken through my enemies before me, like a bursting flood." Therefore the name of that place is called Ba'al-pera'zim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread out in the valley of Reph'aim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, "You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then bestir yourself; for then the LORD has gone out before you to smite the army of the Philistines."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did as the LORD commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
