For he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and secure. For will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godless men are all like thorns that are thrown away; for they cannot be taken with the hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they are utterly consumed with fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshe'beth a Tah-che'monite; he was chief of the three; he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And next to him among the three mighty men was Elea'zar the son of Dodo, son of Aho'hi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand cleaved to the sword; and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the men returned after him only to strip the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the Har'arite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the men fled from the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD wrought a great victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Reph'aim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said longingly, "O that some one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and said, "Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Abi'shai, the brother of Jo'ab, the son of Zeru'iah, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and slew them, and won a name beside the three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He was the most renowned of the thirty, and became their commander; but he did not attain to the three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds; he smote two ariels of Moab. He also went down and slew a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he slew an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but Benai'ah went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things did Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and won a name beside the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three.
