So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of O'bed-e'dom to the city of David with rejoicing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and when those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the horn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, to each a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people departed, each to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, "How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' maids, as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the LORD--and I will make merry before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your eyes; but by the maids of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
