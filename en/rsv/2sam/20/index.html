So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as if in widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said to Ama'sa, "Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be here yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Ama'sa went to summon Judah; but he delayed beyond the set time which had been appointed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said to Abi'shai, "Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Ab'salom; take your lord's servants and pursue him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and cause us trouble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there went out after Abi'shai, Jo'ab and the Cher'ethites and the Pel'ethites, and all the mighty men; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Ama'sa came to meet them. Now Jo'ab was wearing a soldier's garment, and over it was a girdle with a sword in its sheath fastened upon his loins, and as he went forward it fell out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jo'ab said to Ama'sa, "Is it well with you, my brother?" And Jo'ab took Ama'sa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Ama'sa did not observe the sword which was in Jo'ab's hand; so Jo'ab struck him with it in the body, and shed his bowels to the ground, without striking a second blow; and he died.  Then Jo'ab and Abi'shai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And one of Jo'ab's men took his stand by Ama'sa, and said, "Whoever favors Jo'ab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Jo'ab."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Ama'sa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway. And any one who came by, seeing him, stopped; and when the man saw that all the people stopped, he carried Ama'sa out of the highway into the field, and threw a garment over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he was taken out of the highway, all the people went on after Jo'ab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-ma'acah; and all the Bichrites assembled, and followed him in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And all the men who were with Jo'ab came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-ma'acah; they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and they were battering the wall, to throw it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then a wise woman called from the city, "Hear! Hear! Tell Jo'ab, `Come here, that I may speak to you.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came near her; and the woman said, "Are you Jo'ab?" He answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your maidservant." And he answered, "I am listening."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then she said, "They were wont to say in old time, `Let them but ask counsel at Abel'; and so they settled a matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel; you seek to destroy a city which is a mother in Israel; why will you swallow up the heritage of the LORD?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jo'ab answered, "Far be it from me, far be it, that I should swallow up or destroy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That is not true. But a man of the hill country of E'phraim, called Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David; give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city." And the woman said to Jo'ab, "Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Jo'ab. So he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his home. And Jo'ab returned to Jerusalem to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now Jo'ab was in command of all the army of Israel; and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada was in command of the Cher'ethites and the Pel'ethites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Ador'am was in charge of the forced labor; and Jehosh'aphat the son of Ahi'lud was the recorder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and Sheva was secretary; and Zadok and Abi'athar were priests;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and Ira the Ja'irite was also David's priest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
