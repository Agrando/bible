So Bo'az said, "Turn aside, friend; sit down here"; and he turned aside and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, "Sit down here"; so they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then he said to the next of kin, "Na'omi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land which belonged to our kinsman Elim'elech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So I thought I would tell you of it, and say, Buy it in the presence of those sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you." And he said, "I will redeem it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Bo'az said, "The day you buy the field from the hand of Na'omi, you are also buying Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the dead, in order to restore the name of the dead to his inheritance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the next of kin said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when the next of kin said to Bo'az, "Buy it for yourself," he drew off his sandal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Bo'az said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Na'omi all that belonged to Elim'elech and all that belonged to Chil'ion and to Mahlon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his native place; you are witnesses this day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you prosper in Eph'rathah and be renowned in Bethlehem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the children that the LORD will give you by this young woman."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Bo'az took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the women said to Na'omi, "Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without next of kin; and may his name be renowned in Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has borne him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Na'omi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Na'omi." They named him Obed; he was the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hezron of Ram, Ram of Ammin'adab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ammin'adab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Salmon of Bo'az, Bo'az of Obed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Obed of Jesse, and Jesse of David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
