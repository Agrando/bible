Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abram took Sar'ai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions which they had gathered, and the persons that they had gotten in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, "To your descendants I will give this land." So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thence he removed to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sar'ai his wife, "I know that you are a woman beautiful to behold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, `This is his wife'; then they will kill me, but they will let you live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on your account."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Abram entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, he-asses, menservants, maidservants, she-asses, and camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sar'ai, Abram's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Pharaoh called Abram, and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why did you say, `She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her, and be gone."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him; and they set him on the way, with his wife and all that he had.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
