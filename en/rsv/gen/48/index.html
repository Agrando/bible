And he said, "Bring them to me, I pray you, that I may bless them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him; and he kissed them and embraced them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Israel said to Joseph, "I had not thought to see your face; and lo, God has let me see your children also."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joseph took them both, E'phraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manas'seh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of E'phraim, who was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manas'seh, crossing his hands, for Manas'seh was the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has led me all my life long to this day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and in them let my name be perpetuated, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of E'phraim, it displeased him; and he took his father's hand, to remove it from E'phraim's head to Manas'seh's head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father; for this one is the first-born; put your right hand upon his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But his father refused, and said, "I know, my son, I know; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So he blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, `God make you as E'phraim and as Manas'seh'"; and thus he put E'phraim before Manas'seh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
