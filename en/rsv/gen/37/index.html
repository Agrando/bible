Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought an ill report of them to their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they only hated him the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to them, "Hear this dream which I have dreamed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and stood upright; and behold, your sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to my sheaf."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>His brothers said to him, "Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?" So they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he said to him, "Go now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and bring me word again." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man asked him, "What are you seeking?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"I am seeking my brothers," he said, "tell me, I pray you, where they are pasturing the flock."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said, "They have gone away, for I heard them say, `Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, "Let us not take his life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him"--that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty, there was no water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ish'maelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Come, let us sell him to the Ish'maelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers heeded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Mid'ianite traders passed by; and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ish'maelites for twenty shekels of silver; and they took Joseph to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and returned to his brothers, and said, "The lad is gone; and I, where shall I go?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then they took Joseph's robe, and killed a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they sent the long robe with sleeves and brought it to their father, and said, "This we have found; see now whether it is your son's robe or not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he recognized it, and said, "It is my son's robe; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, "No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning." Thus his father wept for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Meanwhile the Mid'ianites had sold him in Egypt to Pot'i-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
