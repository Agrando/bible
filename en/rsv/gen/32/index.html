So he called the name of that place Mahana'im.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Se'ir, the country of Edom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>instructing them, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, `I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and I have oxen, asses, flocks, menservants, and maidservants; and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>thinking, "If Esau comes to the one company and destroys it, then the company which is left will escape."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who didst say to me, `Return to your country and to your kindred, and I will do you good,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am not worthy of the least of all the steadfast love and all the faithfulness which thou hast shown to thy servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and slay us all, the mothers with the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But thou didst say, `I will do you good, and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he lodged there that night, and took from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten he-asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These he delivered into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on before me, and put a space between drove and drove."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He instructed the foremost, "When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, `To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these before you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>then you shall say, `They belong to your servant Jacob; they are a present sent to my lord Esau; and moreover he is behind us.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, "You shall say the same thing to Esau when you meet him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and you shall say, `Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us.'" For he thought, "I may appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the present passed on before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He took them and sent them across the stream, and likewise everything that he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and Jacob's thigh was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he said, "Let me go, for the day is breaking." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go, unless you bless me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he said, "Your name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Jacob asked him, "Tell me, I pray, your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Jacob called the name of the place Peni'el, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun rose upon him as he passed Penu'el, limping because of his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh on the sinew of the hip.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
