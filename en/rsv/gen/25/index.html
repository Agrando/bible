The sons of Dedan were Asshu'rim, Letu'shim, and Le-um'mim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The sons of Mid'ian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abi'da, and Elda'ah. All these were the children of Ketu'rah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Abraham gave all he had to Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>These are the days of the years of Abraham's life, a hundred and seventy-five years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Isaac and Ish'mael his sons buried him in the cave of Mach-pe'lah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the field which Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After the death of Abraham God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt at Beer-la'hai-roi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>These are the descendants of Ish'mael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These are the names of the sons of Ish'mael, named in the order of their birth: Neba'ioth, the first-born of Ish'mael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Ked'emah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are the sons of Ish'mael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(These are the years of the life of Ish'mael, a hundred and thirty-seven years; he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his kindred.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They dwelt from Hav'ilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria; he settled over against all his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham was the father of Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Isaac was forty years old when he took to wife Rebekah, the daughter of Bethu'el the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is thus, why do I live?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples, born of you, shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The first came forth red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they called his name Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Afterward his brother came forth, and his hand had taken hold of Esau's heel; so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When the boys grew up, Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Once when Jacob was boiling pottage, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Esau said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red pottage, for I am famished!" (Therefore his name was called Edom.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Esau said, "I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
