And Abim'elech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God came to Abim'elech in a dream by night, and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man's wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now Abim'elech had not approached her; so he said, "Lord, wilt thou slay an innocent people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Did he not himself say to me, `She is my sister'? And she herself said, `He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me; therefore I did not let you touch her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now then restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you, and all that are yours."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Abim'elech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told them all these things; and the men were very much afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abim'elech called Abraham, and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abim'elech said to Abraham, "What were you thinking of, that you did this thing?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Besides she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, `This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Abim'elech took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah his wife to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Abim'elech said, "Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; it is your vindication in the eyes of all who are with you; and before every one you are righted."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abim'elech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abim'elech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
