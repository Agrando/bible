When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said, "My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>while I fetch a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on--since you have come to your servant." So they said, "Do as you have said."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he took curds, and milk, and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "She is in the tent."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The LORD said, "I will surely return to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife shall have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, and say, `Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, in the spring, and Sarah shall have a son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Sarah denied, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. He said, "No, but you did laugh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the men set out from there, and they looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to set them on their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>seeing that Abraham shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice; so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the LORD said, "Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomor'rah is great and their sin is very grave,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry which has come to me; and if not, I will know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham still stood before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Abraham drew near, and said, "Wilt thou indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Far be it from thee to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the LORD said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Abraham answered, "Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Wilt thou destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Again he spoke to him, and said, "Suppose forty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said, "Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
