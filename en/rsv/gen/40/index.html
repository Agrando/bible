And Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, I pray you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream there was a vine before me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and on the vine there were three branches; as soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his butler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But remember me, when it is well with you, and do me the kindness, I pray you, to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph answered, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head--from you!--and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat the flesh from you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He restored the chief butler to his butlership, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
