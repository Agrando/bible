She was in Chezib when she bore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife he spilled the semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD, and he slew him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up"--for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died; and when Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>she put off her widow's garments, and put on a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, for she had covered her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He went over to her at the road side, and said, "Come, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He answered, "I will send you a kid from the flock." And she said, "Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" She replied, "Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he could not find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he asked the men of the place, "Where is the harlot who was at Enaim by the wayside?" And they said, "No harlot has been here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So he returned to Judah, and said, "I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, `No harlot has been here.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah replied, "Let her keep the things as her own, lest we be laughed at; you see, I sent this kid, and you could not find her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>About three months later Judah was told, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; and moreover she is with child by harlotry." And Judah said, "Bring her out, and let her be burned."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, "By the man to whom these belong, I am with child." And she said, "Mark, I pray you, whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Judah acknowledged them and said, "She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not lie with her again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When the time of her delivery came, there were twins in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when she was in labor, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, "This came out first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out; and she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" Therefore his name was called Perez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zerah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
