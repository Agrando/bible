And he did as Joseph told him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When they had gone but a short distance from the city, Joseph said to his steward, "Up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, `Why have you returned evil for good? Why have you stolen my silver cup?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he divines? You have done wrong in so doing.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; how then should we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said, "Let it be as you say: he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be blameless."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then every man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and every man opened his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they rent their clothes, and every man loaded his ass, and they returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there; and they fell before him to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, "What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord's slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said, "Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah went up to him and said, "O my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, `Have you a father, or a brother?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said to my lord, `We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children; and his father loves him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then you said to your servants, `Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>We said to my lord, `The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then you said to your servants, `Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when our father said, `Go again, buy us a little food,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>we said, `We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then your servant my father said to us, `You know that my wife bore me two sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>one left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I have never seen him since.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the lad's life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die; and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, `If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame in the sight of my father all my life.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, let your servant, I pray you, remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord; and let the lad go back with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how can I go back to my father if the lad is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would come upon my father."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
