He said to the woman, "Did God say, `You shall not eat of any tree of the garden'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but God said, `You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, "I heard the sound of thee in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The man said, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent beguiled me, and I ate."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above all wild animals; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, `You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever"--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
