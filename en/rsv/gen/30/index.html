For the women will call me happy"; so she called his name Asher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Give me, I pray, some of your son's mandrakes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But she said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" Rachel said, "Then he may lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, "You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Leah said, "God has given me my hire because I gave my maid to my husband"; so she called his name Is'sachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons"; so she called his name Zeb'ulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her and opened her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>She conceived and bore a son, and said, "God has taken away my reproach";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and she called his name Joseph, saying, "May the LORD add to me another son!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know the service which I have given you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Laban said to him, "If you will allow me to say so, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>name your wages, and I will give it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jacob said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly; and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said, "What shall I give you?" Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything; if you will do this for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Laban said, "Good! Let it be as you have said."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But that day Laban removed the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in charge of his sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the runnels, that is, the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>the flocks bred in front of the rods and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them with Laban's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding Jacob laid the rods in the runnels before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the rods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but for the feebler of the flock he did not lay them there; so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thus the man grew exceedingly rich, and had large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and asses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
