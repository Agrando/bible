She had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and Sar'ai said to Abram, "Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children; go in to my maid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her." And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sar'ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, Sar'ai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Sar'ai said to Abram, "May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my maid to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Abram said to Sar'ai, "Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her as you please." Then Sar'ai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, "Hagar, maid of Sar'ai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She said, "I am fleeing from my mistress Sar'ai."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit to her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The angel of the LORD also said to her, "I will so greatly multiply your descendants that they cannot be numbered for multitude."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the angel of the LORD said to her, "Behold, you are with child, and shall bear a son; you shall call his name Ish'mael; because the LORD has given heed to your affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall be a wild ass of a man, his hand against every man and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, "Thou art a God of seeing"; for she said, "Have I really seen God and remained alive after seeing him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the well was called Beer-la'hai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ish'mael.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ish'mael to Abram.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
