Now Joseph was handsome and good-looking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said, "Lie with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Lo, having me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>he is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife; how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>she caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me." But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and got out of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled out of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>she called to the men of her household and said to them, "See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to insult us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled and got out of the house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and she told him the same story, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out of the house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, "This is the way your servant treated me," his anger was kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever was done there, he was the doer of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>the keeper of the prison paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph's care, because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made it prosper.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
