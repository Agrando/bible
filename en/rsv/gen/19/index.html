When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and bowed himself with his face to the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and said, "My lords, turn aside, I pray you, to your servant's house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise up early and go on your way." They said, "No; we will spend the night in the street."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But he urged them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they said, "Stand back!" And they said, "This fellow came to sojourn, and he would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the men put forth their hands and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves groping for the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the men said to Lot, "Have you any one else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any one you have in the city, bring them out of the place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up, get out of this place; for the LORD is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he lingered; so the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him forth and set him outside the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they had brought them forth, they said, "Flee for your life; do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley; flee to the hills, lest you be consumed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me, and I die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, yonder city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there--is it not a little one?--and my life will be saved!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Make haste, escape there; for I can do nothing till you arrive there." Therefore the name of the city was called Zo'ar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zo'ar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomor'rah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Lot's wife behind him looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomor'rah and toward all the land of the valley, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Lot went up out of Zo'ar, and dwelt in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to dwell in Zo'ar; so he dwelt in a cave with his two daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the first-born said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they made their father drink wine that night; and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And on the next day, the first-born said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites to this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
