The stone on the well's mouth was large,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place upon the mouth of the well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where do you come from?" They said, "We are from Haran."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" They said, "We know him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to them, "Is it well with him?" They said, "It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said, "Behold, it is still high day, it is not time for the animals to be gathered together; water the sheep, and go, pasture them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they said, "We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and wept aloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh!" And he stayed with him a month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful and lovely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the morning, behold, it was Leah; and Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Laban said, "It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maid.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, "Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; surely now my husband will love me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>She conceived again and bore a son, and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also"; and she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, "Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons"; therefore his name was called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, "This time I will praise the LORD"; therefore she called his name Judah; then she ceased bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
