But the God of my father has been with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You know that I have served your father with all my strength;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If he said, `The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, `The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the mating season of the flock I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream that the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, `Jacob,' and I said, `Here I am!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, `Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that leap upon the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go forth from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has been using up the money given for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>All the property which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children; now then, whatever God has said to you, do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives on camels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he drove away all his cattle, all his livestock which he had gained, the cattle in his possession which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He fled with all that he had, and arose and crossed the Euphra'tes, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, "Take heed that you say not a word to Jacob, either good or bad."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen encamped in the hill country of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have cheated me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why did you flee secretly, and cheat me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, `Take heed that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Any one with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered Rachel's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched, but did not find the household gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jacob became angry, and upbraided Laban; Jacob said to Laban, "What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Although you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>That which was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself; of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thus I was; by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be a witness between you and me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones," and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there by the heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Laban called it Je'gar-sahadu'tha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore he named it Galeed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and the pillar Mizpah, for he said, "The LORD watch between you and me, when we are absent one from the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If you ill-treat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, remember, God is witness between you and me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his kinsmen to eat bread; and they ate bread and tarried all night on the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them; then he departed and returned home.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
