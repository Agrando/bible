Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cain said to Abel his brother, "Let us go out to the field." And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" He said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the LORD said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, thou hast driven me this day away from the ground; and from thy face I shall be hidden; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will slay me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the LORD said to him, "Not so! If any one slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who came upon him should kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Me-hu'ja-el, and Me-hu'ja-el the father of Me-thu'sha-el, and Me-thu'sha-el the father of Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Na'amah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, hearken to what I say: I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, "God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
