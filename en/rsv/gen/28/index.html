Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and by you and your descendants shall all the families of the earth bless themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done that of which I have spoken to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place; and I did not know it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he was afraid, and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that thou givest me I will give the tenth to thee."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
