And Pharaoh awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was none who could interpret it to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh, "I remember my faults today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard; and when we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as he interpreted to us, so it came to pass; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Joseph answered Pharaoh, "It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and seven other cows came up after them, poor and very gaunt and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the thin and gaunt cows ate up the first seven fat cows,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as gaunt as at the beginning. Then I awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The seven lean and gaunt cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>It is as I told Pharaoh, God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of that famine which will follow, for it will be very grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine which are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>you shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only as regards the throne will I be greater than you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaph'enath-pane'ah; and he gave him in marriage As'enath, the daughter of Poti'phera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>During the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and he gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and stored up food in the cities; he stored up in every city the food from the fields around it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Before the year of famine came, Joseph had two sons, whom As'enath, the daughter of Poti'phera priest of On, bore to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Joseph called the name of the first-born Manas'seh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The name of the second he called E'phraim, "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The seven years of plenty that prevailed in the land of Egypt came to an end;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
