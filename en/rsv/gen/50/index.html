So the physicians embalmed Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>forty days were required for it, for so many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My father made me swear, saying, `I am about to die: in my tomb which I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.' Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father; then I will return."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharaoh answered, "Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; it was a very great company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians." Therefore the place was named A'bel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field at Mach-pe'lah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite, to possess as a burying place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil which we did to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave this command before he died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`Say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.' And now, we pray you, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His brothers also came and fell down before him, and said, "Behold, we are your servants."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Joseph said to them, "Fear not, for am I in the place of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones." Thus he reassured them and comforted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joseph saw E'phraim's children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manas'seh were born upon Joseph's knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die; but God will visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, "God will visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
