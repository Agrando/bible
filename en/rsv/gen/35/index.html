So his name was called Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God said to him, "I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your descendants after you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Fear not; for now you will have another son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as her soul was departing (for she died), she called his name Ben-o'ni; but his father called his name Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While Israel dwelt in that land Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it.  Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's first-born), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Is'sachar, and Zeb'ulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid: Dan and Naph'tali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kir'iath-ar'ba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Isaac breathed his last; and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
