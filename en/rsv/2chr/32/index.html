He also made weapons and shields in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he set combat commanders over the people, and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him; for there is one greater with us than with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles." And the people took confidence from the words of Hezeki'ah king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this Sennach'erib king of Assyria, who was besieging Lachish with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezeki'ah king of Judah and to all the people of Judah that were in Jerusalem, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Thus says Sennach'erib king of Assyria, `On what are you relying, that you stand siege in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Is not Hezeki'ah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, "The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Has not this same Hezeki'ah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, "Before one altar you shall worship, and upon it you shall burn your sacrifices"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore do not let Hezeki'ah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And his servants said still more against the Lord GOD and against his servant Hezeki'ah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the LORD the God of Israel and to speak against him, saying, "Like the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hands, so the God of Hezeki'ah will not deliver his people from my hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Hezeki'ah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god, some of his own sons struck him down there with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the LORD saved Hezeki'ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennach'erib king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies; and he gave them rest on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem and precious things to Hezeki'ah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In those days Hezeki'ah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to the LORD; and he answered him and gave him a sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Hezeki'ah did not make return according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Hezeki'ah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezeki'ah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hezeki'ah had very great riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly vessels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This same Hezeki'ah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezeki'ah prospered in all his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to try him and to know all that was in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the rest of the acts of Hezeki'ah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hezeki'ah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manas'seh his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
