in order that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way thou shalt send them, and they pray to thee toward this city which thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for thy name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"If they sin against thee--for there is no man who does not sin--and thou art angry with them, and dost give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>yet if they lay it to heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent, and make supplication to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, `We have sinned, and have acted perversely and wickedly';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>if they repent with all their mind and with all their heart in the land of their captivity, to which they were carried captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now, O my God, let thy eyes be open and thy ears attentive to a prayer of this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"And now arise, O LORD God, and go to thy resting place, thou and the ark of thy might. Let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in thy goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>O LORD God, do not turn away the face of thy anointed one! Remember thy steadfast love for David thy servant."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
