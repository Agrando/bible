Then he returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azali'ah, and Ma-asei'ah the governor of the city, and Jo'ah the son of Jo'ahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They came to Hilki'ah the high priest and delivered the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had collected from Manas'seh and E'phraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They delivered it to the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD gave it for repairing and restoring the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for binders and beams for the buildings which the kings of Judah had let go to ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were set Jahath and Obadi'ah the Levites, of the sons of Merar'i, and Zechari'ah and Meshul'lam, of the sons of the Ko'hathites, to have oversight. The Levites, all who were skilful with instruments of music,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>were over the burden bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service; and some of the Levites were scribes, and officials, and gatekeepers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the LORD, Hilki'ah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD given through Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Hilki'ah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD"; and Hilki'ah gave the book to Shaphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king, "All that was committed to your servants they are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, "Hilki'ah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When the king heard the words of the law he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the king commanded Hilki'ah, Ahi'kam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asai'ah the king's servant, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Hilki'ah and those whom the king had sent went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter) and spoke to her to that effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: `Tell the man who sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which was read before the king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath will be poured out upon this place and will not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words which you have heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because your heart was penitent and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you have humbled yourself before me, and have rent your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants.'" And they brought back word to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites, all the people both great and small; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Josi'ah took away all the abominations from all the territory that belonged to the people of Israel, and made all who were in Israel serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not turn away from following the LORD the God of their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
