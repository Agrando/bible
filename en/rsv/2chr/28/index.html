And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD, like his father David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made molten images for the Ba'als;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his sons as an offering, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For Pekah the son of Remali'ah slew a hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Zichri, a mighty man of E'phraim, slew Ma-asei'ah the king's son and Azri'kam the commander of the palace and Elka'nah the next in authority to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The men of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their kinsfolk, women, sons, and daughters; they also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Sama'ria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army that came to Sama'ria, and said to them, "Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against the LORD your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now hear me, and send back the captives from your kinsfolk whom you have taken, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Certain chiefs also of the men of E'phraim, Azari'ah the son of Joha'nan, Berechi'ah the son of Meshil'lemoth, Jehizki'ah the son of Shallum, and Ama'sa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said to them, "You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring upon us guilt against the LORD in addition to our present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all that were naked among them; they clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them; and carrying all the feeble among them on asses, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Sama'ria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the E'domites had again invaded and defeated Judah, and carried away captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephe'lah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-she'mesh, Ai'jalon, Gede'roth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they settled there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had dealt wantonly in Judah and had been faithless to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Til'gath-pilne'ser king of Assyria came against him, and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Ahaz took from the house of the LORD and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria; but it did not help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the LORD--this same King Ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, and said, "Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me." But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of the house of the LORD; and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, provoking to anger the LORD, the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezeki'ah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
