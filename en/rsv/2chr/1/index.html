And Solomon and the assembly sought the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, "Ask what I shall give you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Solomon said to God, "Thou hast shown great and steadfast love to David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O LORD God, let thy promise to David my father be now fulfilled, for thou hast made me king over a people as many as the dust of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this thy people, that is so great?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God answered Solomon, "Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may rule my people over whom I have made you king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephe'lah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Ku'e, and the king's traders received them from Ku'e for a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
