And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant which he had made with David, and since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah, and set up a king of their own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jeho'ram passed over with his commanders and all his chariots, and he rose by night and smote the E'domites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah also revolted from his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover he made high places in the hill country of Judah, and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, and made Judah go astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And a letter came to him from Eli'jah the prophet, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father, `Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehosh'aphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, as the house of Ahab led Israel into unfaithfulness, and also you have killed your brothers, of your father's house, who were better than yourself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>behold, the LORD will bring a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and you yourself will have a severe sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the disease, day by day.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD stirred up against Jeho'ram the anger of the Philistines and of the Arabs who are near the Ethiopians;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they came up against Judah, and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions they found that belonged to the king's house, and also his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jeho'ahaz, his youngest son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem; and he departed with no one's regret. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
