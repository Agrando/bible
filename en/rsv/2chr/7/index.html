So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the LORD which King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD--for his steadfast love endures for ever--whenever David offered praises by their ministry; opposite them the priests sounded trumpets; and all Israel stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD; for there he offered the burnt offering and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the cereal offering and the fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly; for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's house; all that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the LORD and in his own house he successfully accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the LORD appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him: "I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there for ever; my eyes and my heart will be there for all time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as for you, if you walk before me, as David your father walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my ordinances,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, `There shall not fail you a man to rule Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>then I will pluck you up from the land which I have given you; and this house, which I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And at this house, which is exalted, every one passing by will be astonished, and say, `Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then they will say, `Because they forsook the LORD the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore he has brought all this evil upon them'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
