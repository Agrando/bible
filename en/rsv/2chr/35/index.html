Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Prepare yourselves according to your fathers' houses by your divisions, following the directions of David king of Israel and the directions of Solomon his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And stand in the holy place according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of your brethren the lay people, and let there be for each a part of a father's house of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And kill the passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of the LORD by Moses."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Josi'ah contributed to the lay people, as passover offerings for all that were present, lambs and kids from the flock to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls; these were from the king's possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his princes contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilki'ah, Zechari'ah, and Jehi'el, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred lambs and kids and three hundred bulls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Conani'ah also, and Shemai'ah and Nethan'el his brothers, and Hashabi'ah and Je-i'el and Jo'zabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand lambs and kids and five hundred bulls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the service had been prepared for, the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions according to the king's command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they killed the passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from them while the Levites flayed the victims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they set aside the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of the lay people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so they did with the bulls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they roasted the passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jedu'thun the king's seer; and the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So all the service of the LORD was prepared that day, to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josi'ah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the people of Israel who were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Israel had kept such a passover as was kept by Josi'ah, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josi'ah this passover was kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After all this, when Josi'ah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Car'chemish on the Euphra'tes and Josi'ah went out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he sent envoys to him, saying, "What have we to do with each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make haste. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless Josi'ah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megid'do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the archers shot King Josi'ah; and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josi'ah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josi'ah; and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josi'ah in their laments to this day. They made these an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Josi'ah, and his good deeds according to what is written in the law of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
