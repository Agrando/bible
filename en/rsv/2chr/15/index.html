If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They were broken in pieces, nation against nation and city against city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But you, take courage!
