And Ahab killed an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ahab king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?" He answered him, "I am as you are, my people as your people. We will be with you in the war."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the word of the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?" And they said, "Go up; for God will give it into the hand of the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jehosh'aphat said, "Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micai'ah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil." And Jehosh'aphat said, "Let not the king say so."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micai'ah the son of Imlah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes; and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Sama'ria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Zedeki'ah the son of Chena'anah made for himself horns of iron, and said, "Thus says the LORD, `With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, and said, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the messenger who went to summon Micai'ah said to him, "Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Micai'ah said, "As the LORD lives, what my God says, that I will speak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micai'ah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" And he answered, "Go up and triumph; they will be given into your hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, "I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said, `These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Micai'ah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said one thing, and another said another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, `I will entice him.' And the LORD said to him, `By what means?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, `I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he said, `You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth and do so.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; the LORD has spoken evil concerning you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Zedeki'ah the son of Chena'anah came near and struck Micai'ah on the cheek, and said, "Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Micai'ah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king of Israel said, "Seize Micai'ah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Jo'ash the king's son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and say, `Thus says the king, Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with scant fare of bread and water, until I return in peace.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Micai'ah said, "If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Hear, all you peoples!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." And the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, "Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehosh'aphat, they said, "It is the king of Israel." So they turned to fight against him; and Jehosh'aphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the battle grew hot that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening; then at sunset he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
