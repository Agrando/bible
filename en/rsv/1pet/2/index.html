Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to the kind and gentle but also to the overbearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For one is approved if, mindful of God, he endures pain while suffering unjustly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what credit is it, if when you do wrong and are beaten for it you take it patiently? But if when you do right and suffer for it you take it patiently, you have God's approval.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He committed no sin; no guile was found on his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he trusted to him who judges justly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
