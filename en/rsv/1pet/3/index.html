And you are now her children if you do right and let nothing terrify you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Likewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, all of you, have unity of spirit, sympathy, love of the brethren, a tender heart and a humble mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not return evil for evil or reviling for reviling; but on the contrary bless, for to this you have been called, that you may obtain a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For "He that would love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking guile;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>let him turn away from evil and do right; let him seek peace and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those that do evil."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But even if you do suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are abused, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's will, than for doing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
