He shall not live. He has done all these abominable things; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"But if this man begets a son who sees all the sins which his father has done, and fears, and does not do likewise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>does not wrong any one, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or increase, observes my ordinances, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Yet you say, `Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?' When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The soul that sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"But if a wicked man turns away from all his sins which he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is lawful and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness which he has done he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, says the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and does the same abominable things that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds which he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Yet you say, `The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die for it; for the iniquity which he has committed he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is lawful and right, he shall save his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet the house of Israel says, `The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed against me, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I have no pleasure in the death of any one, says the Lord GOD; so turn, and live."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
