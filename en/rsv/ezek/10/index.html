And he went in before my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in; and a cloud filled the inner court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherubim to the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," he went in and stood beside a wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And a cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling chrysolite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced the others followed without turning as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their rims, and their spokes, and the wheels were full of eyes round about--the wheels that the four of them had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the cherubim mounted up.
