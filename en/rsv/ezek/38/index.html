Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to seize great spoil?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day when my people Israel are dwelling securely, you will bestir yourself</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great host, a mighty army;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>you will come up against my people Israel, like a cloud covering the land. In the latter days I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when through you, O Gog, I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who in those days prophesied for years that I would bring you against them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But on that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the Lord GOD, my wrath will be roused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare, On that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fish of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall quake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will summon every kind of terror against Gog, says the Lord GOD; every man's sword will be against his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples that are with him, torrential rains and hailstones, fire and brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations.
