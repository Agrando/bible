As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then let them know the abominations of their fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, making myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt.  "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they dwelt, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover I gave them my sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I the LORD sanctify them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did not walk in my statutes but rejected my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned.  "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because they rejected my ordinances and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I the LORD am your God; walk in my statutes, and be careful to observe my ordinances,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and hallow my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I the LORD am your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the children rebelled against me; they did not walk in my statutes, and were not careful to observe my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live; they profaned my sabbaths.  "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I withheld my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first-born, that I might horrify them; I did it that they might know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this again your fathers blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their soothing odors, and there they poured out their drink offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So its name is called Bamah to this day.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Wherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go astray after their detestable things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When you offer your gifts and sacrifice your sons by fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"What is in your mind shall never happen--the thought, `Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I will make you pass under the rod, and I will let you go in by number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land; there I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country which I swore to give to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there you shall remember your ways and all the doings with which you have polluted yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"Son of man, set your face toward the south, preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! they are saying of me, `Is he not a maker of allegories?'"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
