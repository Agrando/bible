Then they will know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with horsemen and a host of many soldiers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He will slay with the sword your daughters on the mainland; he will set up a siege wall against you, and throw up a mound against you, and raise a roof of shields against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He will direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wagons and chariots, when he enters your gates as one enters a city which has been breached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people with the sword; and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; your stones and timber and soil they will cast into the midst of the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will stop the music of your songs, and the sound of your lyres shall be heard no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place for the spreading of nets; you shall never be rebuilt; for I the LORD have spoken, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre: Will not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when slaughter is made in the midst of you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then all the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones, and remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments; they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit upon the ground and tremble every moment, and be appalled at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they will raise a lamentation over you, and say to you, `How you have vanished from the seas, O city renowned, that was mighty on the sea, you and your inhabitants, who imposed your terror on all the mainland!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the isles tremble on the day of your fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea are dismayed at your passing.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"For thus says the Lord GOD: When I make you a city laid waste, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you, and the great waters cover you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>then I will thrust you down with those who descend into the Pit, to the people of old, and I will make you to dwell in the nether world, among primeval ruins, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you will not be inhabited or have a place in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will bring you to a dreadful end, and you shall be no more; though you be sought for, you will never be found again, says the Lord GOD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
