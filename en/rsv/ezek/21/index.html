When it comes, every heart will melt and all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes and it will be fulfilled,'" says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Or do we make mirth? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be handled; it is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Cry and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel; they are delivered over to the sword with my people. Smite therefore upon your thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it will not be a testing--what could it do if you despise the rod?" says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Prophesy therefore, son of man; clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yea thrice, the sword for those to be slain; it is the sword for the great slaughter, which encompasses them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that their hearts may melt, and many fall at all their gates. I have given the glittering sword; ah! it is made like lightning, it is polished for slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cut sharply to right and left where your edge is directed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The word of the LORD came to me again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall come forth from the same land. And make a signpost, make it at the head of the way to a city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah and to Jerusalem the fortified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the teraphim, he looks at the liver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Into his right hand comes the lot for Jerusalem, to open the mouth with a cry, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But to them it will seem like a false divination; they have sworn solemn oaths; but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be captured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you, O unhallowed wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban, and take off the crown; things shall not remain as they are; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it; there shall not be even a trace of it until he comes whose right it is; and to him I will give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; say, A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter, it is polished to glitter and to flash like lightning--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you--to be laid on the necks of the unhallowed wicked, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men, skilful to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You shall be fuel for the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be no more remembered; for I the LORD have spoken."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
