And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full maidenhood; your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"When I passed by you again and looked upon you, behold, you were at the age for love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yea, I plighted my troth to you and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord GOD, and you became mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you, and anointed you with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with leather, I swathed you in fine linen and covered you with silk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I decked you with ornaments, and put bracelets on your arms, and a chain on your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus you were decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered cloth; you ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful, and came to regal estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor which I had bestowed upon you, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"But you trusted in your beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and lavished your harlotries on any passer-by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You took some of your garments, and made for yourself gaily decked shrines, and on them played the harlot; the like has never been, nor ever shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You also took your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the harlot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also my bread which I gave you--I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey--you set before them for a pleasing odor, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all your abominations and your harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, weltering in your blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! says the Lord GOD),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>you built yourself a vaulted chamber, and made yourself a lofty place in every square;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>at the head of every street you built your lofty place and prostituted your beauty, offering yourself to any passer-by, and multiplying your harlotry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your harlotry, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you, and diminished your allotted portion, and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yea, you played the harlot with them, and still you were not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You multiplied your harlotry also with the trading land of Chalde'a; and even with this you were not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"How lovesick is your heart, says the Lord GOD, seeing you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen harlot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Men give gifts to all harlots; but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side for your harlotries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So you were different from other women in your harlotries: none solicited you to play the harlot; and you gave hire, while no hire was given to you; therefore you were different.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your shame was laid bare and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotries with your lovers, and because of all your idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you loathed; I will gather them against you from every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will judge you as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will give you into the hand of your lovers, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places; they shall strip you of your clothes and take your fair jewels, and leave you naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall bring up a host against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women; I will make you stop playing the harlot, and you shall also give hire no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So will I satisfy my fury on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you; I will be calm, and will no more be angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things; therefore, behold, I will requite your deeds upon your head, says the Lord GOD.  "Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, every one who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you, `Like mother, like daughter.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And your elder sister is Sama'ria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet you were not content to walk in their ways, or do according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I live, says the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, surfeit of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them, when I saw it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Sama'ria has not committed half your sins; you have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations which you have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have made judgment favorable to your sisters; because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>"I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Sama'ria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in the midst of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and Sama'ria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become like her an object of reproach for the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors, and for the daughters of the Philistines, those round about who despise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>"Yea, thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then you will remember your ways, and be ashamed when I take your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and give them to you as daughters, but not on account of the covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I forgive you all that you have done, says the Lord GOD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
