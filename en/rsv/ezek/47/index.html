Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was up to the loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?"  Then he led me back along the bank of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As I went back, I saw upon the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah; and when it enters the stagnant waters of the sea, the water will become fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And wherever the river goes every living creature which swarms will live, and there will be very many fish; for this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fishermen will stand beside the sea; from En-ge'di to En-eg'laim it will be a place for the spreading of nets; its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says the Lord GOD: "These are the boundaries by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall divide it equally; I swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, and on to Zedad,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Bero'thah, Sib'raim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-e'non, which is on the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This shall be the north side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"On the east side, the boundary shall run from Hazar-e'non between Hauran and Damascus; along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This shall be the east side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"On the south side, it shall run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-ka'desh, thence along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. This shall be the south side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite the entrance of Hamath. This shall be the west side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens who reside among you and have begotten children among you. They shall be to you as native-born sons of Israel; with you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In whatever tribe the alien resides, there you shall assign him his inheritance, says the Lord GOD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
