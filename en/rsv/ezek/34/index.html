Should not shepherds feed the sheep?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the crippled you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food for all the wild beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd; and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As a shepherd seeks out his flock when some of his sheep have been scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the fountains, and in all the inhabited places of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will feed them with good pasture, and upon the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on fat pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the crippled, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will watch over; I will feed them in justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, rams and he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must foul the rest with your feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have fouled with your feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: Behold, I, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will save my flock, they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke, and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them; they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I will provide for them prosperous plantations so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they shall know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, says the Lord GOD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
