I have cast it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Foreigners, the most terrible of the nations, will cut it down and leave it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches will fall, and its boughs will lie broken in all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth will go from its shadow and leave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Upon its ruin will dwell all the birds of the air, and upon its branches will be all the beasts of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to lofty height or set their tops among the clouds, and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height; for they are all given over to death, to the nether world among mortal men, with those who go down to the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Thus says the Lord GOD: When it goes down to Sheol I will make the deep mourn for it, and restrain its rivers, and many waters shall be stopped; I will clothe Lebanon in gloom for it, and all the trees of the field shall faint because of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will make the nations quake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, will be comforted in the nether world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They also shall go down to Sheol with it, to those who are slain by the sword; yea, those who dwelt under its shadow among the nations shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? You shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether world; you shall lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.  "This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
