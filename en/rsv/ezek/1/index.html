And this was their appearance: they had the form of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>their wings touched one another; they went every one straight forward, without turning as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man in front; the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle at the back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the midst of the living creatures there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of a chrysolite; and the four had the same likeness, their construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The four wheels had rims and they had spokes; and their rims were full of eyes round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament, shining like crystal, spread out above their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And under the firmament their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each creature had two wings covering its body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of a host; when they stood still, they let down their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there came a voice from above the firmament over their heads; when they stood still, they let down their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And above the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness as it were of a human form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And upward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were gleaming bronze, like the appearance of fire enclosed round about; and downward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.  Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
