On the day that you were created they were prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With an anointed guardian cherub I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned; so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and the guardian cherub drove you out from the midst of the stones of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I exposed you before kings, to feast their eyes on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your trade you profaned your sanctuaries; so I brought forth fire from the midst of you; it consumed you, and I turned you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who saw you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more for ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, and I will manifest my glory in the midst of you. And they shall know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her, and manifest my holiness in her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the slain shall fall in the midst of her, by the sword that is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"And for the house of Israel there shall be no more a brier to prick or a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Thus says the Lord GOD: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall dwell securely in it, and they shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall dwell securely, when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt.
