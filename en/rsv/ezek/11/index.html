And behold, at the door of the gateway there were twenty-five men; and I saw among them Ja-azani'ah the son of Azzur, and Pelati'ah the son of Benai'ah, princes of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>who say, `The time is not near to build houses; this city is the caldron, and we are the flesh.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, "Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have multiplied your slain in this city, and have filled its streets with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron; but you shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This city shall not be your caldron, nor shall you be the flesh in the midst of it; I will judge you at the border of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and you shall know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in my statutes, nor executed my ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelati'ah the son of Benai'ah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, "Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Son of man, your brethren, even your brethren, your fellow exiles, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, `They have gone far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore say, `Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore say, `Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them; I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and obey them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will requite their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord GOD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chalde'a, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had showed me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
