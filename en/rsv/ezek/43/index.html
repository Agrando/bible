And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their harlotry, and by the dead bodies of their kings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now let them put away their idolatry and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And you, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple and its appearance and plan, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, portray the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, and its whole form; and make known to them all its ordinances and all its laws; and write it down in their sight, so that they may observe and perform all its laws and all its ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is the law of the temple: the whole territory round about upon the top of the mountain shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"These are the dimensions of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): its base shall be one cubit high, and one cubit broad, with a rim of one span around its edge. And this shall be the height of the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, four horns, one cubit high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit round about. The steps of the altar shall face east."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to me, "Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon it and for throwing blood against it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>you shall give to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, says the Lord GOD, a bull for a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall take some of its blood, and put it on the four horns of the altar, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the rim round about; thus you shall cleanse the altar and make atonement for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And on the second day you shall offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be cleansed, as it was cleansed with the bull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a bull without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For seven days you shall provide daily a goat for a sin offering; also a bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it, and so consecrate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they have completed these days, then from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer upon the altar your burnt offerings and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord GOD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
