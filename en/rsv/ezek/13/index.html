There will be a deluge of rain, great hailstones will fall, and a stormy wind break out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, `Where is the daubing with which you daubed it?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath; and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare; when it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have daubed it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who daubed it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own minds; prophesy against them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people, and keep other souls alive for your profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death persons who should not die and keeping alive persons who should not live, by your lies to my people, who listen to lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Wherefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls that you hunt go free like birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Your veils also I will tear off, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not disheartened him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his wicked way to save his life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>therefore you shall no more see delusive visions nor practice divination; I will deliver my people out of your hand.
