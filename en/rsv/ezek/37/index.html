And I answered, "O Lord GOD, thou knowest."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And as I looked, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, `Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you home into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land; then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken, and I have done it, says the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Son of man, take a stick and write on it, `For Judah, and the children of Israel associated with him'; then take another stick and write upon it, `For Joseph (the stick of E'phraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and join them together into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when your people say to you, `Will you not show us what you mean by these?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (which is in the hand of E'phraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him; and I will join with it the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all sides, and bring them to their own land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not defile themselves any more with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; but I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"My servant David shall be king over them; and they shall all have one shepherd.
