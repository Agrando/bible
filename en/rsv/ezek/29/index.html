To the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the air I have given you as food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Then all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD. Because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>when they grasped you with the hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon you, you broke, and made all their loins to shake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste. Then they will know that I am the LORD.  "Because you said, `The Nile is mine, and I made it,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No foot of man shall pass through it, and no foot of beast shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries; and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"For thus says the Lord GOD: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I will restore the fortunes of Egypt, and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin; and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It shall be the most lowly of the kingdoms, and never again exalt itself above the nations; and I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall never again be the reliance of the house of Israel, recalling their iniquity, when they turn to them for aid. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Son of man, Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare; yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had performed against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off its wealth and despoil it and plunder it; and it shall be the wages for his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he labored, because they worked for me, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"On that day I will cause a horn to spring forth to the house of Israel, and I will open your lips among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
