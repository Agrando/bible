The end has come upon the four corners of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the end is upon you, and I will let loose my anger upon you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will punish you for all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end has come, the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land; the time has come, the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways; and I will punish you for all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD, who smite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come, injustice has blossomed, pride has budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness; none of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time has come, the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For wrath is upon all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"They have blown the trumpet and made all ready; but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is without, pestilence and famine are within; he that is in the field dies by the sword; and him that is in the city famine and pestilence devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one over his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All hands are feeble, and all knees weak as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror covers them; shame is upon all faces, and baldness on all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing; their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD; they cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their beautiful ornament they used for vainglory, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it; therefore I will make it an unclean thing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will turn my face from them, that they may profane my precious place; robbers shall enter and profane it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and make a desolation.  "Because the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses; I will put an end to their proud might, and their holy places shall be profaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Disaster comes upon disaster, rumor follows rumor; they seek a vision from the prophet, but the law perishes from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are palsied by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their own judgments I will judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
