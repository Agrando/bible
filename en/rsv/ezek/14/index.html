and sat before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces; should I let myself be inquired of at all by them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him myself because of the multitude of his idols,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to inquire for himself of me, I the LORD will answer him myself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and I will set my face against that man, I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall bear their punishment--the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, nor defile themselves any more with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, says the Lord GOD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the word of the LORD came to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>even if these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; they alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Let a sword go through the land; and I cut off from it man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four sore acts of judgment, sword, famine, evil beasts, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet, if there should be left in it any survivors to lead out sons and daughters, when they come forth to you, and you see their ways and their doings, you will be consoled for the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They will console you, when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord GOD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
