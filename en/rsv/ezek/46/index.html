The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the cereal offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the cereal offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>as a cereal offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the prince enters, he shall go in by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate; and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but each shall go out straight ahead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they go in, the prince shall go in with them; and when they go out, he shall go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"At the feasts and the appointed seasons the cereal offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him; and he shall offer his burnt offering or his peace offerings as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"He shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning he shall provide it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he shall provide a cereal offering with it morning by morning, one sixth of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour, as a cereal offering to the LORD; this is the ordinance for the continual burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons out of his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons, it is their property by inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall revert to the prince; only his sons may keep a gift from his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property; he shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be dispossessed of his property."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests; and there I saw a place at the extreme western end of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the cereal offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so communicate holiness to the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he brought me forth to the outer court, and led me to the four corners of the court; and in each corner of the court there was a court--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long and thirty broad; the four were of the same size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
