And he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his te</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri, but the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said to Amasa, Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be thou here present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together, but he delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom. Take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men. And they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a belt with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath of it. And as he</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand. So he smote him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again, and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites. And they were gathered together, and also went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then a wise woman out of the city cried out, Hear, hear. Say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came near to her, and the woman said, Are thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then she spoke, saying, They were accustomed to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel, and so they ended [the matter].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. Thou seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will thou swallow up the inheritance of LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The matter is not so, but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab re</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Adoram was over the men subject to task work, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
