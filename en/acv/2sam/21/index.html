And LORD said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the king called the Gibeonites, and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the sons of Israel had sworn to them, and [yet] Saul sought to kill them in his zeal</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house, neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that I will do for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, [that] we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of LORD. And the king said, I will give them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites.
