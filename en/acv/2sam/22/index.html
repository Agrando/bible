Thou save me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will call upon LORD, who is worthy to be praised. So I shall be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the waves of death encompassed me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The cords of Sheol were round about me. The snares of death came upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my distress I called upon LORD. Yea, I called to my God. And he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry [came] into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and flew. Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>LORD thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them, lightning, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent from on high, he took me. He drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came upon me in the day of my calamity, but LORD was my support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He brought me forth also into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his ordinances were before me. And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I was also perfect toward him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his eyesight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the merciful thou will show thyself merciful. With the perfect man thou will show thyself perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With the pure thou will show thyself pure. And with the perverse thou will show thyself contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the afflicted people thou will save, but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou may bring them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For thou are my lamp, O LORD. And LORD will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For by thee I run upon a troop. By my God do I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for God, his way is perfect. The word of LORD is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is God, except LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God is my strong fortress, and he guides the perfect in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He makes his feet like hinds' [feet], and sets me upon my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou have also given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy gentleness has made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou have enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them, neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise. Yea, they are fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thou have girded me with strength to the battle. Thou have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thou have also made my enemies turn their backs to me that I might cut off those who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, but there was none to save; even to LORD, but he did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then I beat them small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thou have also delivered me from the strivings of my people. Thou have kept me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The foreigners shall submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their hiding places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>LORD lives. And blessed be my rock. And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Even the God who executes vengeance for me, and who brings down peoples under me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and who brings me forth from my enemies. Yea, thou lift me up above those who rise up against me. Thou deliver me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O LORD, among gentiles, and will sing praises to thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
