And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David and all the house of Israel played before LORD with all manner of [instruments of] fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth to the ark of God, and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the anger of LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error, and he died there by the ark of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David was displeased, because LORD had broken forth upon Uzzah. And he called that place Perez-uzzah, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David was afraid of LORD that day, and he said, How shall the ark of LORD come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So David would not remove the ark of LORD to him into the city of David, but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the ark of LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it was told king David, saying, LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God.
