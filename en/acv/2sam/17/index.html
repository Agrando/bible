And all the people who are with him shall flee. And I will only smite the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and I will bring back all the people to thee. The man whom thou seek is as if all returned, [so] all the people shall be in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Absalom said, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner. Shall we do [after] his saying? If not, speak thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hushai said moreover, Thou know thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field. And thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place. And it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt, for all Israel knows that thy father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that LORD might bring evil upon A</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus have I counseled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Do not lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel. And a maid-servant used to go and tell them, and they went and told king David, for they might not be seen to come into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But a lad saw them, and told Absalom. And they went away quickly, both of them, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his court, and they went down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground grain on it. And nothing was known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they return</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David. And they said to David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water, for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who was not gone over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got home to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself. And he died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when David came to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and roasted [grain], and beans, and lentils, and roasted [pulse],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat. For they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
