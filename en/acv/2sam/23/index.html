David the son of Jesse says, and the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Spirit of LORD spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me. He who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>[he shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, [when] the tender grass [springs] out of the earth, through clear shining after rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Truly my house is not so with God. Yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. For it is all my salvation, and all [my] desire, though he does not make it to grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the worthless shall be as thorns to be thrust away, all of them, because they cannot be taken with the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear, and they shall be utterly burned with fire in [their] place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains, the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And LORD wrought a great victory that day, and the people returned after him only to take spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines. And LORD wrought a great victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David longed, and said, Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it, but poured it out to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this, [to drink] the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Was he not most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain. However he did not attain to the [first] three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he killed an Egyptian, a good-looking man. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name among the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the [first] three.
