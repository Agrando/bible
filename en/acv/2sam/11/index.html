And they destroyed the sons of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David remain</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it came to pass at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David send and inquired after the woman. And he said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David sent messengers, and took her. And she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness), and she returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the woman conceived. And she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Uriah came to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and a gift from the king followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they had told David, saying, Uriah did not go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Have thou not come from a journey? Why did thou not go down to thy house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths, and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? A</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David said to Uriah, Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but did not go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. And there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David, and Uriah the Hittite died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou have made an end of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he says to thee, Why did ye go so near to the city to fight? Did ye not know that they would shoot from the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did ye go so near the wall? Then thou shall say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall. And some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then David said to the messenger, Thus thou shall say to Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make thy battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it. And encourage thou him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
