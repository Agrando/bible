And Amnon the son of David loved her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Amnon was so frustrated that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar. For she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother. And Jonadab was a very sly man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said to him, Why, O son of the king, are thou emaciated this way from day to day? Will thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jonadab said to him, Lay down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick. And when thy father comes to see thee, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may se</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and make food for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she took the pan, and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have all men out from me. And they went out every man from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes that she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lay with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not do thou this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, where shall I carry my shame? And as for thee, thou will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However he would not hearken to her voice, but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that thou did to me. But he would not hearken to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, Put this woman out from me now, and bolt the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she had a garment of various colors upon her, for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her. And she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? But now hold thy peace, my sister. He is thy brother. Do not take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant has sheep-shearers. Let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to thee. And he pressed him. However he would not go, but blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Absalom said, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Notice ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon, then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got up upon his mule, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons, for Amnon only is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined fr</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead, for only Amnon is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons have come; as thy servant said, so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And [the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
