And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine, that such as are faint in the wildern</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem, for he said, Today the house of Israel will restore for me the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is thine. And Ziba said, I do obeisance. Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, cursing as he came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>LORD has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul in whose stead thou have reigned. And LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son, and, behold, thou are [taken] in thine own mischief because thou</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because LORD has said to him, Curse David, who then shall say, Why have thou done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life. How much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? Let him alone, and let him curse, for LORD has bidden him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that LORD will look on the wrong done to me, and that LORD will reward me good for [his] cursing of me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So David and his men went by the way, and Shimei went along on the hill-side opposite him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king, and all the people who were with him, came weary, and he refreshed himself there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Live, O king. Live, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why did thou not go with thy friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Hushai said to Absalom, No, but whom LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And again, whom should I serve? [Is it] not in the presence of his son? As I have served in thy father's presence, so I will be in thy presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines that he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that thou are abhorred by thy father. Then the hands of all who are with thee will be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
