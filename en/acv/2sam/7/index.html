And I will make thee a great name, like the name of the great ones that are on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. Neither shall the sons of iniquity afflict them any more, as at the first,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover LORD tells thee that LORD will make thee a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shall sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure forever before thee; thy throne shall be established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then David the king went in, and sat before LORD. And he said, Who am I, O lord LORD, and what is my house, that thou have brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O lord LORD, but thou have spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and this [too] according to the manner of men, O lord LORD!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what can David say more to thee? For thou know thy servant, O lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, thou have wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thou are great, O LORD God, for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And what one nation on the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for thy land, before thy people whom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And thou established to thyself thy people Israel to be a people to thee forever, and thou, LORD, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou have spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as thou have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let thy name be magnified forever, saying, LORD of hosts is God over Israel, and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house. Therefore thy servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O lord LORD, thou are God, and thy words are truth, and thou have promised this good thing to thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue forever before thee, for thou, O lord LORD, have spoken it. And with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
