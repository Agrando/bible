So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the rulers of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Think thou that David honors thy father, in that he has sent comforters to thee?
