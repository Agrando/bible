And the king said to the peo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the people said, Thou shall not go forth. For if we flee away, they will not care for us, neither if half of us die, will they care for us, but thou are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that thou be ready to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said to them, What seems best to you I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak. And he was taken up between sky and earth, and t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Joab said to the man who told him, and, behold, thou saw it, and why did thou not smite him there to the ground? And I would have given thee ten [pieces of] silver, and a belt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [pieces of] silver in my hand, yet I would not put forth my hand against the king's son, for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself would have set thyself against [me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Joab said, I will not delay thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And ten young men who bore Joab's armor encompassed about and smote Absalom, and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab held back the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king's valley, for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. And he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absa</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that LORD has avenged him of his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joab said to him, Thou shall not be the bearer of news this day, but thou shall bear news another day. But this day thou shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou have seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why will thou run, my son, seeing that thou will have no reward for the news?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But come what may, [he said], I will run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there is news in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold, [another] man running alone. And the king said, He also brings news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be LORD thy God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the ki</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, behold, the Cushite came. And the Cushite said, News for my lord the king, for LORD has avenged thee this day of all those who rose up against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
