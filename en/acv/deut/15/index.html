He shall not exact it from his neighbor and his brother, because LORD's release has been proclaimed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>From a foreigner thou may exact it, but whatever of thine is with thy brother, thy hand shall release.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>However there shall be no poor with thee (for LORD will surely bless thee in the land which LORD thy God gives thee for an inheritance to possess it),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>if only thou diligently hearken to the voice of LORD thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For LORD thy God will bless thee as he promised thee, and thou shall lend to many nations, but thou shall not borrow, and thou shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If there be with thee a poor man, one of thy brothers, within any of thy gates in thy land which LORD thy God gives thee, thou shall not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but thou shall surely open thy hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need which he wants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Beware that there not be a base thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand, and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nothing, and he cry to LORD against thee, and it be</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou shall surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou give to him, because for this thing LORD thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou put thy hand to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the poor will never cease out of the land. Therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shall surely open thy hand to thy brother, to thy needy, and to thy poor, in thy land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to thee, and serves thee six years, then in the seventh year thou shall let him go free from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when thou let him go free from thee, thou shall not let him go empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shall furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress. As LORD thy God has blessed thee thou shall give to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou shall remember that thou were a bondman in the land of Egypt, and LORD thy God redeemed thee. Therefore I command thee this thing today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be, if he says to thee, I will not go out from thee, because he loves thee and thy house, because he is well with thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then thou shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be thy servant forever. And also to thy maid-servant thou shall do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It shall not seem hard to thee when thou let him go free from thee, for he has been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years. And LORD thy God will bless thee in all that thou do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shall sanctify to LORD thy God. Thou shall do no work with the firstling of thy herd, nor shear the firstling of thy flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou shall eat it before LORD thy God year by year in the place which LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if it has any blemish, [as] lame or blind, any ill blemish whatever, thou shall not sacrifice it to LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou shall eat it within thy gates. The unclean [man] and the clean [man] alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only thou shall not eat the blood of it. Thou shall pour it out upon the ground as water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
