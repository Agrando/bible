And, behold, if the witness is a FALSE witness, and has testified falsely against his brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>then ye shall do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother. So shall thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thine eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
