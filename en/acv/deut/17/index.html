And, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then thou shall bring forth that man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to thy gates, even the man or the woman, and thou shall stone them to death with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he who is to die be put to death. He shall not be put to death at the mouth of one witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shall put away the evil from the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates, then thou shall arise, and get thee up to the plac</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days, and thou shall inquire.
