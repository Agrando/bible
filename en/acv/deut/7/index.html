Thou shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Neither shall thou make marriages with them. Thy daughter thou shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall thou take to thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods, so the anger of LORD will be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But thus shall ye deal with them: Ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thou are a holy people to LORD thy God. LORD thy God has chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people, for ye were the fewest of all peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but because LORD loves you. And because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know therefore that LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thou shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that LORD thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to thy fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee. He will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock, in the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And LORD will take away from thee all sickness. And none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou know, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all those who hate thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou shall consume all the peoples that LORD thy God shall deliver to thee. Thine eye shall not pity them. Neither shall thou serve their gods, for that will be a snare to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If thou shall say in thy heart, These nations are more than I. How can I dispossess them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shall not be afraid of them. Thou shall remember well what LORD thy God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm by which LORD thy God brought thee out. So shall LORD thy God do to all the peoples of whom thou are afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover LORD thy God will send the hornet among them until those who are left and hide themselves perish from before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shall not be frightened at them, for LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and awesome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And LORD thy God will cast out those nations before thee little by little. Thou may not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But LORD thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great confusion until they be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shall make their name to perish from under heaven. There shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Ye shall burn the graven images of their gods with fire. Thou shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it to thee, lest thou be snared by it, for it is an abomination to LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And thou shall not bring an abomination into thy house, and become a devoted thing like it. Thou shall utterly detest it, and thou shall utterly abhor it, for it is a cursed thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
