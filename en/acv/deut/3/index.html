And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And LORD said to me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand.

There was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the un-walled towns a great many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to mount Hermon</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(the Sidonians call Hermon, Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.
