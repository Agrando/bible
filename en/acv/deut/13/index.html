Thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw thee away from LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall no more do any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If thou shall hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which LORD thy God gives thee to dwell there, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Certain base fellows have gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then thou shall inquire, and make search, and ask diligently.
