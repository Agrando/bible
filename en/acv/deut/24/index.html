And it shall be righteousness to thee before LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brothers, or of thy sojourners that are in thy land within thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou shall give him his hire in his day, neither shall the sun go down upon it, for he is poor, and sets his heart upon it, lest he cry against thee to LORD, and it be sin to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, neither shall the sons be put to death for the fathers.
