They shall eat the offerings of LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they shall have no inheritance among their brothers. LORD is their inheritance as he has spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep: that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The first-fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, thou shall give him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For LORD thy God has chosen him out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the name of LORD, him and his sons forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if a Levite comes from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourns, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which LORD shall choose,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then he shall minister in the name of LORD his God, as all his brothers the Levites do who stand there before LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of his patrimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When thou have come into the land, which LORD thy God gives thee, thou shall not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There shall not be found with thee anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, a psychic, he who practices augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>or a charmer, or a medium, or a spiritist, or a necromancer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For whoever does these things is an abomination to LORD. And because of these abominations LORD thy God drives them out from before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shall be perfect with LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For these nations, that thou shall dispossess, hearken to those who practice augury, and to psychics. But as for thee, LORD thy God has not allowed thee to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>LORD thy God will raise up for thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brothers, like me. Ye shall hearken to him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>according to all that thou desired of LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And LORD said to me, They have well said that which they have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will raise up a prophet for them from among their brothers, like thee. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it shall come to pass, that whoever will not hearken to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if thou say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which LORD has not spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When a prophet speaks in the name of LORD, if the thing does not follow, nor come to pass, that is the thing which LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. Thou shall not be afraid of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
