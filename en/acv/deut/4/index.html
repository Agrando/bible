For all the men who followed Baal-peor, LORD thy God has destroyed them from the midst of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But ye who clung to LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land where ye go in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Keep therefore and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For what great nation is there that has a god so near to them, as LORD our God is whenever we call upon him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And what great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life, but make them known to thy sons and thy son's sons--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the day that thou stood before LORD thy God in Horeb, when LORD said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. Ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form, only a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. And he wrote them upon two tablets of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land where ye go over to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Take ye therefore good heed to yourselves, for ye saw no manner of form on the day that LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make for you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And lest thou lift up thine eyes to heaven, and when thou see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which LORD thy God has allotted to all the peoples</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Furthermore LORD was angry with me because of you, and swore that I would not go over the Jordan, and that I would not go in to that good land, which LORD thy God gives thee for an inheritance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but I must die in this land.
