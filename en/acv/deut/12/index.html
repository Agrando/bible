And ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye shall not do so to LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to the place which LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation ye shall seek, and there thou shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there ye shall eat before LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand to, ye and your households, in which LORD thy God has blessed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which LORD thy God gives thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which LORD your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then it shall come to pass that to the place which LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there, there ye shall bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offe</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye shall rejoice before LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite who is within your gates--inasmuch as he has no portion nor inheritance with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou see,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but in the place which LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes.
