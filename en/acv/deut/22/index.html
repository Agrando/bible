Thou shall surely bring them again to thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And if thy brother be not near to thee, or if thou do not know him, then thou shall bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seeks after it, and thou shall restore it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And so shall thou do with his donkey, and so shall thou do with his garment, and so shall thou do with every lost thing of thy brother's, which he has lost, and thou have found. Thou may not hide thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thou shall not see thy brother's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them. Thou shall surely help him to lift them up again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment, for whoever does these things is an abomination to LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs, thou shall not take the dam with the young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou shall surely let the dam go, but the young thou may take to thyself, that it may be well with thee, and that thou may prolong thy days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When thou build a new house, then thou shall make a guard rail for thy roof, that thou not bring blood upon thy house, if any man falls from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou shall not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited: the seed which thou have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thou shall not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou shall make for thee fringes upon the four borders of thy clothing, with which thou cover thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and dislikes her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and charges her with shameful things, and brings up an evil name upon her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I did not find in her the tokens of virginity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>then the father of the damsel, and her mother, shall take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the damsel's father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he dislikes her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, lo, he has charged her with shameful things, saying, I did not find in thy daughter the tokens of virginity, and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.

So shall thou</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If a man be found laying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman.
