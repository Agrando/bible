He will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee. So thou shall drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as LORD h</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do not speak thou in thy heart, after LORD thy God has thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness LORD has brought me in to possess this land. Whereas for the wickedness of these nations LORD drives them out fro</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, do thou go in to possess their land, but for the wickedness of these nations LORD thy God drives them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which LO</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Know therefore, that LORD thy God does not give thee this good land to possess it for thy righteousness, for thou are a stiff-necked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, do not thou forget how thou provoked LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that thou went forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have been rebellious against LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also in Horeb ye provoked LORD to wrath, and LORD was angry with you to destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When I was gone up onto the mount to receive the tablets of stone, even the tablets of the covenant which LORD made with you, then I abode on the mount forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And LORD delivered to me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God. And on them [was] according to all the words, which LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, that LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, even the tablets of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And LORD said to me, Arise, get thee down quickly from here, for thy people that thou have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them. They have made t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Furthermore LORD spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven, and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against LORD your God. Ye had made you a molten calf. Ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which LORD had commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I took hold of the two tablets, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I fell down before LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of LORD, to provoke him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which LORD was angry against you to destroy you. But LORD hearkened to me that time also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And LORD was very angry with Aaron to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. And I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended out of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked LORD to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you, then ye rebelled against the commandment of LORD your God, and ye did not believe him, nor hearken to his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye have been rebellious against LORD from the day that I knew you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So I fell down before LORD the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because LORD had said he would destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I prayed to LORD, and said, O lord LORD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou have redeemed through thy greatness, that thou have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their profaneness, nor to their sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>lest the land from where thou brought us out say, Because LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou brought out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
