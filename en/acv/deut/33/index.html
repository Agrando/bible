He shined forth from mount Paran, and he came from the ten thousands of holy ones. At his right hand was a fiery law for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yea, he loves the people. All his sanctified are in thy hand, and they sat down at thy feet. He shall receive from thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moses commanded for us a law, an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he was king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let Reuben live, and not die, nor let his men be few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this [is] of Judah: And he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him into his people. With his hands he contended for himself, and thou shall be a help against his adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy holy man, whom thou proved at Massah, with whom thou strove at the waters of Meribah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge his brothers, nor knew he his own sons, for they have observed thy word, and keep thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, and Israel thy law. They shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands. Smite through the loins of those who rise up against him, and of those who hate him, that they not rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of LORD shall dwell in safety by him.
