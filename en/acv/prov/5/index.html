Incline thine ear to my understanding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that thou may preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the lips of an interloping woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Her feet go down to death. Her steps take hold on Sheol,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>so that she does not find the level path of life.
