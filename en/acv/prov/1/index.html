The foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they shall be a garland of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If they say, Come with us. Let us lay wait for blood. Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those who go down into the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We shall find all precious substance. We shall fill our houses with spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shall cast thy lot among us. We will all have one bag.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My son, walk not thou in the way with them. Restrain thy foot from their path.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain. It takes away the life of the owners of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wisdom cries aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the broad places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>She cries in the chief place of concourse, at the entrance of the gates, in the city. She utters her words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Turn back at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you. I will make my words known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because I have called, and ye have refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man has regarded,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but ye have made all my counsel void, and want none of my reproof,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I also will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear comes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>when your fear comes as a storm, and your calamity comes on as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the backsliding of the simple shall kill them, and the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he who hearkens to me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
