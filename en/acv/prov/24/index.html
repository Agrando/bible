He opens not his mouth in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who devises to do evil, men shall call him a mischief-maker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The thought of folly is sin. And the scoffer is an abomination to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Deliver those who are carried away to death, and hold thou back those who are ready to be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If thou say, Behold, we did not know this, Does not he who weighs the hearts consider it? And he who keeps thy soul, does he not know it? And shall not he render to every man according to his work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My son, eat thou honey, for it is good, and the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to thy taste,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>so the knowledge of wisdom [is] to thy soul. If thou have found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy hope shall not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lay not in wait, O wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous. Do not destroy his resting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again, but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Rejoice not when thine enemy falls, and let not thy heart be glad when he is overthrown,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>lest LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, nor be thou envious at the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For there shall be no reward to the evil man. The lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, fear thou LORD and the king, [and] do not associate with those who are given to change.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For their calamity shall rise suddenly, and the destruction from them both, who knows it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These also are from the wise: To have respect of persons in judgment is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who says to a wicked man, Thou are righteous, peoples shall curse him, nations shall abhor him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But to those who rebuke [him] shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who gives a right answer kisses the lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Prepare thy work outside, and make it ready for thee in the field, and afterwards build thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause, and deceive not with thy lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Say not, I will do so to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I went by the field of the sluggard, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns. The face of it was covered with nettles, and the stone wall of it was broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then I beheld, and considered well. I saw, and received instruction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>[Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>so thy poverty shall come as a robber, and thy want as an armed man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
