What will thou do in the end of it when thy neighbor has put thee to shame?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Debate thy case with thy neighbor [himself], and disclose not the secret of another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>lest he who hears it revile thee, and thine infamy turn not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A word fitly spoken is apples of gold in a network of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>An earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, [is] a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, [is] a faithful messenger to those who send him, for he refreshes the soul of his masters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Clouds and wind without rain, [is] he who boasts himself of his gifts falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>By long-suffering a ruler is persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have thou found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled with it, and vomit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbor's house, lest he be weary of thee, and hate thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A man who bears FALSE witness against his neighbor is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As he who takes off a garment in cold weather, [and] vinegar upon soda, so [is] he who sings songs to a heavy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If thine enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For thou will heap coals of fire upon his head, and LORD will reward thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The north wind brings forth rain. So does a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman in a wide house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>[As] cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring, [is] a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is not good to eat much honey, so [for men] to search out their own glory is grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He whose spirit is without restraint is a city that is broken down and without walls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
