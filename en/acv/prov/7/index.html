Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Say to wisdom, Thou are my sister, and call understanding [thy] kinswoman,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that they may keep thee from the interloping woman, from the stranger who flatters with her words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>passing through the street near her corner. And he went the way to her house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, behold, there met him a woman attired like a harlot, and wily of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She is loud and headstrong. Her feet abide not in her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lays in wait at every corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me. I have paid my vows this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore I came forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning. Let us solace ourselves with love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the man is not at home. He has gone a long journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>With her much fair speech she causes him to yield. With the flattering of her lips she forces him along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He goes after her straightaway, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>till an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hastens to the snare. And he does not know that it is for his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now therefore, ye sons, hearken to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let not thy heart decline to her ways. Go not astray in her paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For she has cast down many wounded. Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
