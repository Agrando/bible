Out of thine own wisdom, cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For it certainly makes itself wings, like an eagle that flies toward heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Eat thou not the bread of an evil eye, nor desire thou his dainties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For as he thinks within himself, so [is] he. Eat and drink, he says to thee, but his heart is not with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The morsel which thou have eaten thou shall vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Speak not in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Remove not the ancient landmark. And enter not into the fields of the fatherless,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for their Redeemer is strong. He will plead their cause against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Apply thy heart to instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Withhold not correction from the child, [for] if thou beat him with the rod, he will not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart will be glad, even mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, my heart will rejoice when thy lips speak right things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let not thy heart envy sinners, but [be thou] in the fear of LORD all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For surely there is a reward, and thy hope shall not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thy heart in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Be not among winebibbers, among gluttonous eaters of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe [a man] with rags.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hearken to thy father who begot thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Buy the truth, and do not sell it, [yea], wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The father of a righteous man will greatly rejoice, and he who begets a wise son will have joy of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let thy father and thy mother be glad, and let her who bore thee rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My son, give me thy heart, and let thine eyes delight in my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For a harlot is a deep ditch, and an interloping woman is a narrow pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yea, she lays in wait as a robber, and increases the treacherous among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who has woe?
