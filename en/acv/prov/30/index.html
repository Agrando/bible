The man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and I have not learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has bound the waters in his garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou k</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every word of God is tried. He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Add thou not to his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Two things I have asked of thee, deny me not before I die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remove far from me falsehood and lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>lest I be full, and deny [thee], and say, Who is LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and use the name of my God profanely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Slander not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is a generation who curses their father, and does not bless their mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is a generation who are pure in their own eyes, and [yet] are not washed from their filthiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eyelids are lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There is a generation whose teeth are swords, and their jaw teeth, knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The leach has two daughters, [crying], Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, [yea], four that do not say, Enough:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Sheol, and the barren womb, the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire that does not say, Enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maiden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For three things the earth trembles, and for four, [which] it cannot bear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a servant when he is king, and a fool when he is filled with food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for a hateful woman when she is married, and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There are four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceedingly wise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the conies are but a feeble folk, yet they make their houses in the rocks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>the lizard takes hold with her hands, yet she is in kings' palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There are three things which are stately in their march, yea, four which are stately in going:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, and turns not away from any,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the greyhound, also the he-goat, and the king against whom there is no rising up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If thou have done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou have thought evil, [lay] thy hand upon thy mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
