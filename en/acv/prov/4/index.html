Forsake ye not my law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I was a son to my father, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he taught me, and said to me, Let thy heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Get wisdom, get understanding. Do not forget, nor decline from the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not forsake her, and she will preserve thee. Love her, and she will keep thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wisdom [is] the principal thing. Get wisdom, yea, with all thy getting get understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Exalt her, and she will promote thee. She will bring thee to honor when thou embrace her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She will give to thy head a garland of grace, a crown of beauty she will deliver to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of thy life shall be many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have taught thee in the way of wisdom. I have led thee in paths of uprightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When thou go, thy steps shall not be restricted. And if thou run, thou shall not stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Take firm hold of instruction. Do not let her go. Keep her, for she is thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Avoid it. Do not pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For they do not sleep unless they do evil. And their sleep is taken away unless they cause to fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of the wicked is as darkness.
