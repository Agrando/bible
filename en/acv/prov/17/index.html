A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who mocks a poor man reproaches his maker. He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Son's sons are the crown of old men, and the glory of sons are their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Excellent speech is not appropriate to a fool, much less lying lips to a prince.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who has it; wherever it turns, it prospers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who covers a transgression seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates chief friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A rebuke enters deeper into him who has understanding than a hundred stripes into a fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>An evil man seeks only rebellion. Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let a man meet a bear robbed of her cubs, rather than a fool in his folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The beginning of strife is [like] letting out water. Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who justifies a wicked man, and he who condemns a righteous man, both of them alike are an abomination to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, since he has no understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes surety in the presence of his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He loves transgression who loves strife. He who raises high his gate seeks destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who has a wayward heart finds no good, and he who has a perverse tongue falls into mischief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who begets a fool [it is] to his sorrow, and the father of a fool has no joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a broken spirit dries up the bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A wicked man receives a bribe out of the bosom, to pervert the ways of justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wisdom is before the face of him who has understanding, but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her who bore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Also to punish a righteous man is not good, [nor] to smite nobles for uprightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who spares his words has knowledge, and he who is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is considered wise. When he shuts his lips, he is prudent.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
