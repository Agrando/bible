Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do not give sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Go to the ant, thou sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Which, having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How long will thou sleep, O sluggard? When will thou arise out of thy sleep?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so thy poverty shall come as a robber, and thy want as an armed man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>who winks with his eyes, who speaks with his feet, who makes signs with his fingers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who sows discord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly. Suddenly he shall be broken, and that without remedy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There are six things which LORD hates, yea, seven which are an abomination to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>a heart that devises wicked purposes, feet that are swift in running to mischief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>a FALSE witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and do not forsake the law of thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Bind them continually upon thy heart. Tie them about thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When thou walk, it shall lead thee. When thou sleep, it shall watch over thee. And when thou awake, it shall talk with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the stranger's tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Do not lust after her beauty in thy heart, nor let her take thee with her eyelids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the price of a harlot is as much as a piece of bread, but the adulteress hunts for the precious life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Or can a man walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So [is] he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. Whoever touches her shall not be unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Men do not despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold. He shall give all the substance of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who would destroy his own soul does it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Wounds and dishonor he shall get, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For jealousy is a man's fury, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He will not regard any ransom, nor will he be satisfied, though thou give many gifts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
