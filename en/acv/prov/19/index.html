And he who hastens with his feet sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The foolishness of a man subverts his way, and his heart rages against LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wealth adds many friends, but a poor man is separated from his friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A FALSE witness shall not be unpunished, and he who utters lies shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Many will entreat the favor of a generous man, and every man is a friend to him who gives gifts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the brothers of a poor man hate him, how much more do his friends go far from him! He pursues [with] words, [but] they are gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A FALSE witness shall not be unpunished, and he who utters lies shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Luxurious living is not fitting for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion, but his favor is as dew upon the grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A foolish son is the calamity of his father, and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, and the idle soul shall suffer hunger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul. He who is careless of his ways shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who has pity upon a poor man lends to LORD, and he will repay him his good deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty, for if thou deliver [him], thou must do it yet again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou may be wise in thy latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There are many devices in a man's heart, but the counsel of LORD, that shall stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness, and a poor man is better than a liar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The fear of LORD is life to a man, and he shall abide satisfied. He shall not be visited with evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Smite a scoffer, and a simple man will learn prudence. And reprove him who has understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who does violence to his father, and chases away his mother, is a son that causes shame and brings reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To err from the words of knowledge, cease, my son, to hear instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A worthless witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Judgments are prepared for scoffers, and stripes for the back of fools.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
