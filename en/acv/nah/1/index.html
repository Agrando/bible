The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>LORD is a jealous God and avenges. LORD avenges and is full of wrath. LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves [wrath] for his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear [the guilty]. LORD has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is up heaved at his presence. Yea, the world, and all who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who can stand before his indignation? And who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble, and he knows those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But with an over running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What do ye devise against LORD? He will make a full end. Affliction shall not rise up the second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He has gone forth out of thee, who devises evil against LORD, who counsels wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says LORD: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so they shall be cut down. And he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now I will break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And LORD has given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown. Out of the house of thy gods I will cut off the graven image and the molten image. I will make thy grave, for thou are vile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah. Perform thy vows, for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee. He is utterly cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
