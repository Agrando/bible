Keep the fortress. Watch the way. Make thy loins strong. Fortify thy power mightily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For LORD restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel, for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The shield of his mighty men is made red. The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress [spears] are brandished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways. The appearance of them is like torches. They run like the lightnings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He remembers his nobles. They stumble in their march. They make haste to the wall of it, and the mantelet is prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it is decreed.

And the heart melts, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all have grown pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion [and] the lioness walked, the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, I am against thee, says LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions.
