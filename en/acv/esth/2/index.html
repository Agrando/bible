For she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful. And when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house to the custody of Heg</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him.

And she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king made a great feast to all his rulers and his servants, even Esther's feast, and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts according to the bounty of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her.
