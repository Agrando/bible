Keep thyself pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>No longer drink water, but use a little wine because of thy stomach and thy frequent weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sins of some men are evident, leading to judgment, but also for some they follow after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise also good works are evident, and those faring otherwise cannot be hid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
