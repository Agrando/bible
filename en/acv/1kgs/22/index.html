And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou are, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, for LORD will deliver it into the hand of the k</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the kin</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for him horns of iron, and said, Thus says LORD, With these thou shall push the Syrians until they be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper, for LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth. Let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Micaiah said, As LORD lives, what LORD says to me, that I will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper, and LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And LORD said, These have no master, let them return every man to his house in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And [Micaiah] said, Therefore hear thou the word of LORD. I saw LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before LORD, and said, I will entice him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And LORD said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shall entice him, and shall also prevail. Go forth, and do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore, behold, LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and LORD has spoken evil concerning thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the Spirit of LORD go from me to speak to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shall see on that day when thou shall go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I come in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel, and they turned aside to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army, for I am severely wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the battle increased that day. And the king was propped up in his chariot against the Syrians. And he died at evening, and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there went a cry throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves [there]), according to the word of LORD which he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he walked in all the way of Asa his father. He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of LORD. However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high pla</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he put away out of the land the remnant of the sodomites, who remained in the days of his father Asa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And there was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, how he made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger LORD, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
