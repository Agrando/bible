Now therefore make thou lighter the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye to me to return an answer to this people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they spoke to him, saying, If thou will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that grew up with him, who stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, What counsel give ye, that we may return an answer to this people who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father put upon us lighter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the young men that grew up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall thou say to this people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter to us; thus shall thou speak to them, My little f</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king did not hearken to the people, for it was a thing brought about by LORD, that he might establish his word, which LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine own hous</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as for the sons of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the men subject to task work. And all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David, but only the tribe of Jud</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to R</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the sons of Israel.

So they hearkened to the word of LORD, and returned and went their way according to the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein. And he went out from there, and built Penuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah. And they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. And he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he set the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this thing became a sin, for the people went [to worship] before the one, even to Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar.
