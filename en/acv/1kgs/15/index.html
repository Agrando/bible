And his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom [Absalom].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him. And his heart was not perfect with LORD his God as the heart of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless for David's sake LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because David did that which was right in the eyes of LORD, and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. And his grandmother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom [Absalom].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of LORD as David his father did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And also he removed Maacah his grandmother from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. And Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with LORD all his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he brought into the house of LORD the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son o</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[There is] a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father. Behold, I have sent to thee a present of silver and gold. Go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted. And they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built. And king Asa built with it Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah. And he reigned over Israel two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam. He left to Jeroboam not any who breathed, until he had destroyed him according to the saying of LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Sh</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked LORD, the God of Israel, to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, [and reigned] twenty-four years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
