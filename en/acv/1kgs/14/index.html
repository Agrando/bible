Behold, there is Ahijah the prophet who spoke concerning me that I should be king ov</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him. He will tell thee what shall become of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were set because of his age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of thee concerning her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus thou shall say to her, for it will be, when she comes in, that she will feign herself to be another wo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam. Why feign thou thyself to be another? For I am sent to thee with heavy news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says LORD, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee, and yet thou have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart to do only that which was right in my eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but have done evil above all who were before thee, and have gone and made thee other gods, and molten images to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind thy back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam as a man sw</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat, and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat, for LORD has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house. When thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him, for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward LORD, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover LORD will raise up a king for him over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. But what? Even now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For LORD will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water. And he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River because they have made their Asherim, provoking LO</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his fathers. And Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they also built for them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which LORD drove out before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he took away the treasures of the house of LORD, and the treasures of the king's house. He even took away all. And he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept the door of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it was so, that, as often as the king went into the house of LORD, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
