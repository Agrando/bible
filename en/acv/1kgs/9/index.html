I have hallowed this house, which thou have built, to put my name there forever. And my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetuall</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as for thee, if thou will walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your sons, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them. And this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight. And Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And though this house is so high, yet shall every man who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss. And they shall say, Why has LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and they shall answer, Because they forsook LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore has LORD brought all this evil upon</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of LORD and the king's house</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that king Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him. And they did not please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, What cities are these which thou have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is the reason for the conscription which king Solomon raised to build the house of LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them Solomon raised a conscription of bondservants to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But of the sons of Israel Solomon made no bondservants, but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his rulers, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that labored in the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which [Solomon] had built for her. Then he built Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And three times a year Solomon offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built to LORD, burning incense therewith, [upon the altar] that was before LORD. So he finished the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came to Ophir, and fetched gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
