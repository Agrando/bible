And he made side-chambers round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The lowest story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad, for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house round about, that [the beams] should not be fastened i</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the house, when it was being built, was built of stone made ready at the quarry. And there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house. And they went up by winding stairs into the middle [story], and out of the middle into the third.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he built the house, and finished it. And he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the word of LORD came to Solomon, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Concerning this house that thou are building, if thou will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will establish my word with thee, which I spoke to David thy father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he built the walls of the house inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood. And he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls [of the ceiling]. He built [them] for it inside, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the house, that is, the temple in front of [the oracle], was forty cubits [long].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there was cedar on the house inside, carved with knops and open flowers. All was cedar; there was no stone seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house inside, to set there the ark of the covenant of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And inside the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height of it. And he overlaid it with pure gold. And he covered the altar with cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Solomon overlaid the house inside with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across before the oracle, and he overlaid it with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the whole house he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub. From the outermost part of the one wing to the outermost part of the other were ten cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the other cherub was ten cubits; both of the cherubim were of one measure and one form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so it was of the other cherub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he set the cherubim inside the inner house. And the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood. The lintel [and] door-posts were a fifth part [of the wall].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So [he made] two doors of olive-wood. And he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. And he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So he also made for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood out of a fourth part [of the wall],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and two doors of fir-wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he carved [thereon] cherubim and palm trees and open flowers. And he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the fourth year the foundation of the house of LORD was laid, in the month Ziv.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all the parts of it, and according to all the fashion of it. So he was seven years in building it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
