And when he sat down, his disciples came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are the poor in spirit, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed are those who mourn, because they will be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Blessed are the meek, because they will inherit the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, because they will be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed are the merciful, because they will obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed are the pure in heart, because they will see God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Blessed are the peacemakers, because they will be called sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed are those who have been persecuted because of righteousness, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Blessed are ye when they revile you, and persecute you, and say every evil word, being deceitful against you because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, because your reward is great in the heavens, for so they persecuted the prophets before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye are the salt material of the earth. But if the salt material becomes ineffective, by what will it be salted? It is potent for nothing further, except to be cast outside and to be trodden down by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye are the light of the world. A city setting on a hill cannot be hid,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus your light should shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Think not that I came to abolish the law or the prophets. I came not to abolish, but to fulfill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly I say to you, until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle will, no, not pass away from the law, until all things come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever therefore may relax one of these least commandments, and may teach men so, he will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens. But whoever may do and may teach them, this man will be called great in the kingdom of the he</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness abounds more than of the scholars and Pharisees, ye will, no, not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye have heard that it was said to them in old times, Thou shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to the judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you, that every man who is angry at his brother without cause will be liable to the judgment, and whoever speaks an insult to his brother will be liable to the council, and whoever says, Foolish man, will be liable to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore thou should bring thy gift to the altar, and remember there that thy brother has anything against thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave there thy gift before the altar, and go. First be reconciled to thy brother, and then, after coming, bring thy gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Be agreeing with thine opponent quickly, while thou are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the subordinate, and thou will be cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Truly I say to thee, thou will, no, not come out from there, until thou have paid the last quadran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shall not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you, that every man who looks on a woman to crave her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if thy right eye causes thee to stumble, remove it and cast it from thee, for it is advantageous for thee that one of thy body-parts should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if thy right hand causes thee to stumble, cut it off and cast it from thee, for it is advantageous for thee that one of thy body-parts should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it was said, Whoever may divorce his wife, let him give her a divorce certificate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you, that whoever may divorce his wife apart from a matter of fornication, disposes her to commit adultery, and whoever may marry her who has been divorced commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Again, ye have heard that it was said to them in old times, Thou shall not swear falsely, but shall render to the Lord thine oaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say to you, not to swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Neither shall thou swear by thy head, because thou cannot make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your word be, Yes, yes, No, no. And anything beyond these is from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say to you, not to resist what is troublesome, but whoever will strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And to the man who wants to sue thee, and take away thy coat, thou shall leave him thy cloak also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whoever will draft thee for one mile, go thou with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him who asks thee, and turn thou not away from him who wants to borrow from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shall love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>so that ye may become sons of your Father in the heavens, because he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and makes rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if ye love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the tax collectors the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if ye only greet your friends, what do ye extra? Do not even the tax collectors this way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Ye therefore shall be perfect, even as your Father in the heavens is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
