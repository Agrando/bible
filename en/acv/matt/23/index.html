And they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the hems of their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be designated by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But be ye not designated Rabbi, for one is your leader, the Christ, and ye are all brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And do not designate a father of you upon the earth, for one is your Father, he in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And be ye not designated leaders, for one is your leader, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the greater of you will be your helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he who will exalt himself will be made low, and he who will make himself low will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye close up the kingdom of the heavens ahead of men. For ye enter not in, nor do ye allow those who are entering to enter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye devour widows' houses, and praying long in pretence. Because of this ye will receive greater condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye encompass the sea and the land to make one proselyte, and when it happens, ye make him twice more a son of hell than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Woe to you, ye blind guides, who say, Whoever may swear by the temple, it is nothing, but whoever may swear by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye foolish and blind men, for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, Whoever may swear by the altar, it is nothing, but whoever may swear by the gift upon it, he is obligated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye foolish and blind men, for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by all things on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who dwells in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye tithe the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law--justice and mercy and faith. These things must be done, and not neglecting t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye blind guides, who strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but inside they are full of plunder and unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, so that the outside of them may also become clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In this way also, ye indeed outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside ye are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchers of the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then ye testify to yourselves that ye are sons of those who murdered the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then fill ye up the measure of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how will ye escape from the damnation of hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Because of this, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scholars. And some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and will persecute from city to city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Truly I say to you, that all these things will come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who have been sent to her. How often I wanted to gathered thy children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and ye would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, your house is left to you desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I say to you, ye will, no, not see me henceforth, until ye say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
