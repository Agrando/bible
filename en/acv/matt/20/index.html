And he says to them, Why have ye stood here idle the whole day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever would be right ye will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having become evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his manager, Call the workmen, and render to them their wage, having begun from the last until the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who came about the eleventh hour, each received a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more. And they also received a denarius each.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they received it, they murmured against the house-ruler,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, These last did one hour, and thou have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But having answered, he said to one of them, Friend, I do not wrong thee. Did thou not agree with me for a denarius?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take thine and go. But I want to give to this last man, as to thee also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Is it not permitted for me to do what I want with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the last will be first, and the first last, for many are called but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And while going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples in private on the way, and he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scholars. And they will condemn him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and will deliver him to the Gentiles to ridicule, and to scourge, and to crucify. And the third day he will rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, worshiping, and asking something from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to her, What do thou want? She says to him, Speak that these my two sons may sit, one at thy right hand and one at thy left hand in thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But having answered, Jesus said, Ye know not what ye are asking. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am going to drink, or to be immersed the immersion that I am immersed? They say to him, We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he says to them, Ye will indeed drink my cup, and ye will be immersed the immersion that I am immersed. But to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared by my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the ten heard it, they were indignant about the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But having summoned them, Jesus said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord over them, and their eminent men have power over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But it shall not be so among you. Rather whoever wants to become great among you, he shall be your helper,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whoever wants be first among you shall be your bondman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Just as the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, having heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Be merciful to us, Lord, thou son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the multitude rebuked them, so that they would be quiet, but they cried out greater, saying, Be merciful to us, Lord, thou son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And having stood still, Jesus called them and said, What do ye want that I would do to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having felt compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and straightaway they received their sight, and followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
