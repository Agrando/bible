And David begot Solomon from the widow of Uriah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and Solomon begot Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Asa begot Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and Uzziah begot Jotham, and Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Josiah begot Jechoniah and his brothers during the Babylonian exile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and Zerubbabel begot Abiud, and Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and Azor begot Zadoc, and Zadoc begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Eliud begot Eleazar, and Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian exile fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian exile to the Christ fourteen generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was this way. For his mother Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found having in her womb from Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not wanting to expose her to public disgrace, intended to dismiss her privately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But while he considered these things, behold, an agent of Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take Mary to be thy wife, for that which was begotten in her is from Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she will bring forth a son, and thou shall call his name JESUS, for he will save his people from their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now all this has come to pass, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the virgin will have in her womb, and will bring forth a son. And they will call his name Immanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joseph, being roused from his sleep, did as the agent of Lord ordered him. And he took his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and knew her not until she brought forth her son, the firstborn. And he called his name JESUS.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
