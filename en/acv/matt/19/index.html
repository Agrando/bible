What therefore God has joined together, no man shall separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a writing of divorcement, and to divorce her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He says to them, For your hard heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it did not happened this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, that whoever may divorce his wife, not for fornication, and will marry another, commits adultery. And he who married her who has been divorced commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples say to him, If the case of the man with his wife is this way, it is not advantageous to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, Not all men can accommodate this saying, but to whom it has been given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs who were born this way from their mother's belly, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who is able to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then children were brought to him, so that he would lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Allow the children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for of such kind is the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having laid his hands on them, he departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold one man having come to him, said, Good teacher, what good thing should I do so that I may have eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, Why do thou call me good? There is none good except one, God. But if thou want to enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not testify falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honor the father and mother, and, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man says to him, All these things I have kept from my youthfulness. What do I lack yet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, If thou want to be perfect, go, sell the things being possessed by thee, and give to the poor, and thou will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowing, for he was having many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I say to you, that a rich man will enter into the kingdom of the heavens difficultly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the hole of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having looked, Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then having answered, Peter said to him, Lo, we have forsaken all, and followed thee. What then will be for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man will sit on the throne of his glory, ye also will sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every man who has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, because of my name, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many first will be last, and last, first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
