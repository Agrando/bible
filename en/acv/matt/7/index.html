Seek, and ye will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For every man who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or what man is there of you, who, if his son may ask for bread, will give him a stone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if he may ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If ye therefore, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children, how much more your Father in the heavens will give good things to those who ask him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things therefore, as many as ye may want that men should do to you, so also do ye to them, for this is the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Enter ye in by the narrow gate, because wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many are they who enter through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How narrow is the gate, and restricted the way, that leads to life, and few are those who find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But beware of FALSE prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are predatory wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From their fruits ye will know them. Do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Likewise every good tree produces good fruits, but the corrupt tree produces bad fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, nor a corrupt tree produce good fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So then from their fruits ye will know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not every man who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of my Father in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy name do many mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then I will profess to them, I never acknowledged you. Depart from me, ye who work lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore every man, whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will compare him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it had been founded upon the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every man who hears these sayings of mine, and does not do them, will be compared to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell. And great was the fall of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these sayings, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as their scholars.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
