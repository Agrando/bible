For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And having answered, he said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God, because of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and thy mother, and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him perish in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But ye say, Whoever may say to the father or the mother, Whatever thou might have benefited from me is an offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he will, no, not honor his father or mother. And ye have annulled the command of God because of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people comes near me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far distant from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in vain they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And having called in the multitude, he said to them, Hear and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that which enters into the mouth defiles the man, but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then having come near, his disciples said to him, Know thou that the Pharisees were offended when they heard the saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But having answered, he said, Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant, will be uprooted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Leave them. They are blind leaders of blind men, and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a ditch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having answered, Peter said to him, Explain this parable to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus said, Are ye also still without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do ye not yet understand, that everything entering into the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into a toilet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things coming out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and those things defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For from the heart comes forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, FALSE witnessings, revilings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are things defiling the man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having gone out from there, Jesus departed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, a Canaanite woman having come out from those regions, cried out to him, saying, Be merciful to me, O Lord, thou son of David, my daughter is grievously demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples having approached, they besought him, saying, Send her away, because she cries out behind us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But having answered, he said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But having come, she worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having answered, he said, It is not right to take the children's bread and cast it to the house dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, Yes, Lord, for even the house dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus having answered, said to her, O woman, great is thy faith. Be it done for thee as thou desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And having departed from there, Jesus came near the sea of Galilee. And having gone up onto the mountain, he sat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And many multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, crippled, and many others. And they placed them beside Jesus' feet, and he healed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so as for the multitudes to marvel seeing the mute speaking, the maimed healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus having summoned his disciples, he said, I feel compassion toward the multitude because they continue with me now three days and do not have what they might eat. And I do not want to dismiss them without food, lest they mi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his disciples say to him, From where are so many loaves for us in a wilderness so as to feed so great a multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And after taking the seven loaves and the fishes, having expressed thanks, he broke in pieces, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all ate and were filled. And they took up seven hampers full of the fragments that remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having dismissed the multitudes, he entered into the boat, and came into the regions of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
