Hypocrites! Ye indeed know how to discern the face of the sky, but the signs of the times ye are not able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet. And having left them behind, he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And his disciples having come to the other side, they forgot to take loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jesus said to them, Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they deliberated among themselves, saying, We took no loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having known it, Jesus said to them, O ye of little faith, why do ye deliberate among yourselves because ye brought no loaves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many hampers ye took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How do ye not understand that I spoke to you not about bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that he said not to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Jesus came into the regions of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say I, the Son of man, am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they said, Some, John the immerser, others, Elijah, but others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He says to them, But who say ye, I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Simon Peter having answered, said, Thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having answered, Jesus said to him, Blessed are thou, Simon Bar-jonah, because flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I also say to thee, that thou are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever thou may bind on earth will be what is bound in the heavens, and whatever thou may loose on the earth will be what is loosed in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he commanded his disciples that they should tell no man that he is Jesus, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scholars, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him, saying, Be merciful to thee, Lord. This will, no, not be to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But having turned around, he said to Peter, Go thee behind me, Satan. Thou are my stumbling-block, because thou regard not the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any man wants to come behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever wants save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what does it profit a men, if he should gain the whole world, and lose his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his heavenly agents, and then he will reward each man according to his actions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly I say to you, there are some of those who stand here, who will, no, not taste of death, until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
