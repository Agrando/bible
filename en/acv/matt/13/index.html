This is that which was sown by the wayside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And that which was sown upon the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and straightaway receiving it with joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet he has no root in himself, instead it is temporary. And when tribulation or persecution develops because of the word, straightaway he is caused to stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And that which was sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the care of this age, and the deceitfulness of wealth, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But that which was sown upon the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who indeed bears fruit, and is productive, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He set forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man sowing good seed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst the wheat, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares also appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the bondmen of the house-ruler having come, they said to him, Sir, did thou not sow good seed in thy field? From where then does it have tares?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, A hostile man did this. And the bondmen said to him, Do thou desire therefore, after going, we would gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, No, lest while gathering up the tares, ye uproot the wheat together with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Allow both to grow together until the harvest. And at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles in order to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He set forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard plant, which having taken, a man sowed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Which indeed is smaller than all seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the plants, and becomes a tree, so as for the birds of the sky to come and lodge in the branches of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He spoke another parable to them. The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which having taken, a woman hid in three measures of meal until it was all leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes, and he did not speak to them independent of a parable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things concealed from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then having sent the multitudes away, Jesus came into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And having answered, he said to them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are heavenly agents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned in fire, so it will be at the end of this age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man will send forth his agents, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks, and those doing lawlessness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man having found, he hid. And from the joy of it, he goes and sells all, as many things as he has, and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a merchant, seeking fine pearls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who, having found one very valuable pearl, after departing, sold all, as many things as he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered from every kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was full, after dragging to the shore, having sat down, they gathered the good into vessels, but they cast out the useless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So it will be at the end of the age. The heavenly agents will come forth, and separate the bad from among the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yes, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said to them, Because of this every scholar who has been instructed in the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a house-ruler, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these parables, he departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And having come into his fatherland he taught them in their synagogue, so as for them to be astonished, and say, From where is this wisdom and powers in this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And his sisters, are they not all near us? From where then are all these things in this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his fatherland, and in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
