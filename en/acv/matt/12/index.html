And they interrogated him, asking if it permitted to heal on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, What man of you will there be, who will have one sheep, and if this falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not grasp it, and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much therefore a man is superior to a sheep. So then it is permitted to do good on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he says to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth, and it was restored whole, as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when they went out, the Pharisees held a consultation against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having known it Jesus withdrew from there, and many multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he chided them so that they would not make him known,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, my Boy whom I chose, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will declare justice to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will not quarrel, nor will he shout, nor will any man hear his voice in the thoroughfares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised reed he will not break, and smoldering flax he will not quench, until he sends forth justice for victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name Gentiles will hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then a blind and mute man being demon possessed, was brought to him. And he healed him, so as for the blind and mute man both to speak and to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Is this not the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebub the ruler of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having known their thoughts Jesus said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to ruin, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this they will be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come near you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or how can any man enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because of this I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy of the spirit will not be forgiven men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in the present age, nor in the one that is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt, for the tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I say to you, that every idle word, whatever men may speak, they will render account about it in the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For from thy words thou will be justified, and from thy words thou will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then some of the scholars and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But having answered, he said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea-creature three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But when the unclean spirit goes forth out of the man, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and finds it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then it says, I will return into my house from where I came out. And when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then it goes, and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having enter in, they dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will also be to this evil generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he was still speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers had stood outside, seeking to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And some man said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But having answered, he said to the man who told him, Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And having stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, he said, Behold, my mother and my brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whoever does the will of my Father in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
