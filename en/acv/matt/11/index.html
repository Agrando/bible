A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did ye go out to see? A man clothed in delicate clothes? Behold, those wearing delicate things are in king's houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what did ye go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he about whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face who will prepare thy way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly I say to you, among men born of women there has not been raised a greater than John the immerser. Yet the smaller in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the days of John the immerser until now the kingdom of the heavens is treated aggressively, and aggressors seize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if ye are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is going to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling to their companions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and saying, We piped to you, and ye did not dance, we mourned to you, and ye did not beat the breast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold the man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! And wisdom is justified from her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works occurred, because they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! Because if the mighty works that occurred in you occurred in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou, Capernaum, which was exalted as far as the sky. Thou will be brought down as far as Hades, because if the mighty works had occurred in Sodom that occurred in thee, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus having responded at that time, said, I extol thee, O Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, because thou hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to the childlike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yea, Father, because this way it was done pleasing in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things were delivered to me by my Father. And no man knows the Son, except the Father, nor does any man know the Father, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son wants to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to me, all ye who labor and have been burdened, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, because I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is befitting, and my burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
