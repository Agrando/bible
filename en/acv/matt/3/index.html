Make his paths straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now John himself had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather belt about his waist. And his food was locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region of the Jordan went out to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and they were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, Ye offspring of vipers, who showed you to flee from the coming wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And think not to say within yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I indeed immerse you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He will immerse you in a Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whose winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. And he will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be immersed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But John was preventing him, saying, I have need to be immersed by thee, and thou come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But having answered, Jesus said to him, Allow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allows him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Jesus was immersed, he went up straightaway out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
