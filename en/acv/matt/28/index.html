Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after going quickly, tell his disciples, He was raised from the dead, and lo, he goes before you into Galilee. There ye will see him. Behold, I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And after coming out quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy, they ran to notify his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, Hail. And having come, they held his feet and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus says to them, Fear not. Go notify my brothers that they should depart into Galilee, and there they will see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now while they were going, behold, some of the security having come into the city, reported to the chief priests all the things that happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after assembling with the elders, and having taken consultation, they gave many silver pieces to the soldiers, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Say ye, His disciples, having come by night, stole him from us while we slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this should be heard by the governor, we will persuade him, and will make you worry free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having taken the silver pieces, they did as they were instructed. And this saying was spread abroad among the Jews until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the eleven disciples went for Galilee to the mountain where Jesus arranged for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but men doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus having come, he spoke to them, saying, All authority in heaven and on earth was given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After going, make ye disciples of all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all things, as many as I commanded you. And lo, I am with you all the days, until the end of the age. Truly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
