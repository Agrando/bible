If thou desire, we could make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were exceedingly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And having come, Jesus touched them and said, Arise, and fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, except Jesus only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And while they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man will rise from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his disciples questioned him, saying, Why then do the scholars say that Elijah must first come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And having answered, Jesus said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I say to you, that Elijah already came, and they knew him not, but did to him how many things they wanted. Likewise also the Son of man is going to suffer by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them about John the immerser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling to him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lord, be merciful to my son, because he is lunatic, and suffers badly. For he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having answered, Jesus said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon departed from him. And the boy was cured from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples having come to Jesus in private, said, Why could we not cast it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For truly I say to you, if ye have faith as a grain of a mustard plant, ye will say to this mountain, Remove from here to there, and it will depart, and nothing will be impossible t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they turned back in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up. And they were exceedingly sorry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they came to Capernaum, those who receive the double-drachma came to Peter, and said, Does not your teacher pay the double-drachma?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He says, Yes. And when he entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What think thou, Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they take taxes or tribute, from their sons or from strangers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Therefore the sons are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But, so that we might not offend them, after going to the sea, cast a hook. And take up the first fish coming up, and having opened its mouth, thou will find a four-drachma coin. After taking that, give thou to them for me and thee</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
