He has risen from the dead, and because of this the powers work in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Herod having arrested John, bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For John said to him, It is not permitted for thee to have her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And though he wanted to kill him, he feared the multitude because they held him as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Herod's birthday being brought, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And she, having been put forward by her mother, says, Give me here on a platter the head of John the immerser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he became sad, but because of the oaths, and of those dining together, the king commanded it to be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the maiden, and she brought it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after coming, his disciples took up the body and buried it, and having gone, they informed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Jesus heard it, he departed from there in a boat into a desolate place in private. And when the multitudes heard of it, they followed him on foot from the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And having come forth, Jesus saw a great multitude, and he felt compassion toward them, and healed the feeble of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having become evening, his disciples came to him, saying, The place is desolate, and the hour is now past. Send the multitudes away, so that having gone into the villages, they may buy food for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them, They have no need to depart. Give ye them to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they say to him, We have not here, except five loaves and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he said, Bring them here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And after commanding the multitudes to sit down on the grass, having taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, having looking up to heaven, he blessed. And having broken them in pieces, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all ate, and were filled. And they took up that which remained of the fragments, twelve baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And straightaway Jesus compelled the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, until he would dismiss the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having dismissed the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain in private to pray. And having become evening, he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, being buffeted by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking upon the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost, and they cried out from fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But straightaway Jesus spoke to them, saying, Cheer up. It is I, fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having answered him, Peter said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Come. And having come down from the boat, Peter walked upon the water to go to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But seeing the boisterous wind, he was afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And straightaway having stretched forth his hand, Jesus took hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why did thou doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they entered into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those who came in the boat worshiped him, saying, Thou really are the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when they crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when they recognized him, the men of that place sent into that whole region round about, and brought to him all those faring badly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment. And as many as touched were healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
