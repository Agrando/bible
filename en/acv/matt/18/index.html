For it is necessary that the stumbling-blocks come, yet woe to that man through whom the stumbling-block comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if thy hand or thy foot causes thee to stumble, cut them off and cast from thee. It is good for thee to enter into life crippled or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if thine eye causes thee to stumble, remove it and cast it from thee. It is good for thee to enter into life one-eyed, than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>See that ye not disparage one of these little ones, for I say to you, that in the heavens their agents do always behold the face of my Father in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>What does it seem to you? If it happens a hundred sheep are with some man, and one of them went astray, after going (having left the ninety-nine on the mountains), does he not seek the one going astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you, that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So, it is not a purpose before your Father in the heavens, that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if thy brother should sin against thee, go and reprove him between thee and him alone. If he should hear thee, thou have gained thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he should not hear, take with thee one or two besides, so that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he is heedless of them, speak to the church. But if he is also heedless of the church, let him be to thee as the heathen and the tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly I say to you, however many things ye may bind on the earth will be things that are bound in heaven, and however many things ye may loose on the earth will be things that that are loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say to you truly, that if two of you should agree on the earth concerning every matter, whatever they might ask, it will happen for them from my Father in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter having come to him, he said, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus says to him, I say to thee, not until seven times, but until seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because of this the kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a king, who wanted to settle account with his bondmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he began to settle, one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But of him not having to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all things, as many as he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The bondman therefore having fallen down, worshiped him, saying, Lord, be patient toward me and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And having felt compassion, the lord of that bondman released him, and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after going out, that bondman found one of his fellow bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii. And having grabbed him, he choked him, saying, Pay me if thou owe anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So his fellow bondman having fallen down at his feet, besought him, saying, Be patience toward me, and I will pay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he would not, instead, having left him, he cast him into prison until he would pay that which was owed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when his fellow bondmen saw the things that happened, they were extremely sorry. And after coming, they reported to their lord all the things that happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord having summoned him, he says to him, Thou evil bondman, I forgave thee all that debt because thou besought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Was it not necessary for thee also to be merciful to thy fellow bondman, as I also was merciful to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having become angry, his lord delivered him to the tormentors until he would pay all that was due to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if ye do not forgive each man his brother, from your hearts, their trespasses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
