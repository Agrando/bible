Go ye forth for his gathering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those virgins were roused, and put their lamps in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the foolish said to the wise, Give us from your olive oil, because our lamps are going out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise answered, saying, Perhaps there may not be enough for us and you. But go ye rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. And the prepared entered in with him for the wedding festivities, and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But afterward the other virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But having answered, he said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch therefore, because ye know not the day nor the hour in which the son of man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, like a man going on a journey, he called his own bondmen, and delivered to them the things possessed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his personal ability, and straightaway he journeyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And having departed, the man who received the five talents worked with them, and made five other talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And likewise also the man of the two gained two others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But having departed, the man who received the one dug in the ground, and hid his lord's silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes, and takes up accounting with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having come, the man who received the five talents brought five other talents, saying, Lord, thou delivered five talents to me, lo, I have gained five other talents besides them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman. Thou were faithful over a few things, I will appoint thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And also having come, the man who received the two talents said, Lord, thou delivered two talents to me, lo, I have gained two other talents besides them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman. Thou were faithful over a few things, I will appoint thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the man who received the one talent also having come, said, Lord, I knew thee that thou are a hard man, reaping where thou did not sow, and gathering from where thou did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And after being afraid, having gone, I hid thy talent in the ground. Lo, thou have thine own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But having answered, his lord said to him, Thou evil and lazy bondman, thou knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather from where I did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thou ought therefore to have placed my silver with the bankers, and having come I would have received back my own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take ye therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to every man who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast ye the unprofitable bondman into the outer darkness. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the holy agents with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from each other, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he will truly place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the King will say to those at his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat. I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink. I was a stranger, and ye took me in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>naked, and ye clothed me. I was feeble, and ye came to help me. I was in prison, and ye came to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, and fed thee, or thirsting, and gave thee drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in, or naked, and clothed thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when did we see thee weak, or in prison, and came to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having answered, the King will say to them, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it to one of these my brothers, the least, ye did it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he will also say to those at the left hand, Depart from me, ye accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his agents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat, I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger, and ye did not take me in, naked, and ye did not clothe me, weak, and in prison, and ye did not come to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then they will also answer, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or weak, or in prison, and did not serve thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these least, ye did it not to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
