They sacrificed to the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yet I taught Ephraim to walk. I took them on my arms, but they did not know that I healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love, and I was to them as those who lift up the yoke on their jaws. And I laid food before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return [to me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And my people are bent on backsliding from me. Though they call them to [him who is] on high, none at all will exalt [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [How] shall I cast thee off, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? [How] shall I set thee as Zeboiim? My heart is turned within me. My compassions are kindled together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will not execute the fierceness of my anger. I will not return to destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee, and I will not come in wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall walk after LORD, who will roar like a lion. For he will roar, and the sons shall come trembling from the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria. And I will make them to dwell in their houses, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ephraim encompasses me around with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit, but Judah yet rules with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
