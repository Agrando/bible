He has smitten, and he will bind us up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>After two days he will revive us. On the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And let us know, let us follow on to know LORD. His going forth is sure as the morning, and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>O Ephraim, what shall I do to thee? O Judah, what shall I do to thee? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goes away early.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore I have hewed them by the prophets. I have slain them by the words of my mouth. And thy judgments are [as] the light that goes forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant.

Yea, they have committed iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. Whoredom is there in Ephraim; Israel is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee when I bring back the captivity of my people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
