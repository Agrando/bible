He continually multiplies lies and desolation. And they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>LORD has also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways. He will recompense him according to his doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he had strength with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yea, he had strength over the [heavenly] agent, and prevailed, [as] he wept, and made supplication to him. He found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But LORD God Almighty shall be his memorial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore turn thou to thy God. Keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[He is] a Canaanite. The balances of deceit are in his hand. He loves to oppress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Ephraim said, Surely I have become rich. I have found wealth for myself. In all my labors they shall find no iniquity in me that is sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I am LORD thy God from the land of Egypt. I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have also spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions. And by the ministry of the prophets I have used similitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Is Gilead iniquity? They are altogether false. In Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks. Yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And by a prophet LORD brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ephraim has provoked to anger most bitterly. Therefore his blood shall be left upon him, and his reproach his LORD shall return to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
