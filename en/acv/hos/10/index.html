According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars. According to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Their heart is divided. Now they shall be found guilty. He will smite their altars. He will destroy their pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Surely now they shall say, We have no king, for we fear not LORD. And the king, what can he do for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They speak [vain] words, swearing falsely in making covenants. Therefore judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven. For the people of it shall mourn over it, and the priests of it, who rejoiced over it for the glory of it, because it has departed from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It shall also be carried to Assyria for a present to king Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[As for] Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars, and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Israel, thou have sinned from the days of Gibeah. There they stood. The battle against the sons of iniquity does not overtake them in Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When it is my desire, I will chastise them. And the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loves to tread out [the grain]. But I have passed over upon her fair neck. I will set a rider on Ephraim. Judah shall plow. Jacob shall break his clods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Sow to yourselves in righteousness. Reap according to kindness. Break up your fallow ground, for it is time to seek LORD, till he comes and rains righteousness upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye have plowed wickedness. Ye have reaped iniquity. Ye have eaten the fruit of lies. For thou trusted in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore a tumult shall arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle; the mother was dashed in pieces with her sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So shall Bethel do to you because of your great wickedness. At daybreak the king of Israel shall be utterly cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
