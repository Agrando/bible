For ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the revolters have gone deep in making slaughter, but I am a rebuker of them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me. For now, O Ephraim, thou have played the harlot; Israel is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their doings will not allow them to turn to their God, for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they do not know LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity. Judah also shall stumble with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek LORD, but they shall not find him. He has withdrawn himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have dealt treacherously against LORD, for they have borne strange sons. Now the new moon shall devour them with their fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven, behind thee, O Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke. I have made known that which shall surely be among the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The rulers of Judah are like those who remove the landmark. I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ephraim is oppressed. He is crushed in judgment, because he was content to walk after [man's] command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I am to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb. But he is not able to heal you, nor will he cure you of your wound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear and go away, I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face. In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
