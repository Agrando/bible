They break out, and blood touches blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore the land shall mourn, and everyone who dwells in it shall languish with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens. Yea, the fishes of the sea shall also be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet, let no man strive, nor let any man reprove, for thy people are as those who strive with the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And thou shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night. And I will destroy thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because thou have rejected knowledge, I also will reject thee, that thou shall be no priest to me. Since thou have forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me. I will change their glory into shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be, like people, like priest. And I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall eat, and not have enough. They shall play the harlot, and shall not increase, because they have left off taking heed to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares to them, for the spirit of whoredom has caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, [departing] from under their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow of it is good. Therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery. For themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes. And the people who do not understand shall be ove</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend, and come not ye to Gilgal, nor go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As LORD lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Israel has behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.
