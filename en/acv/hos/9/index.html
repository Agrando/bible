Their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners. All who eat of it shall be polluted, for their bread shall be for their appetite.

The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God. As for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, [and] enmity in the house of his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity. He will visit their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season.
