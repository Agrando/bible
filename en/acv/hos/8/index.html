As an eagle [he comes] against the house of LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They shall cry to me, My God, we, Israel know thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Israel has cast off that which is good. The enemy shall pursue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They have set up kings, but not by me. They have made rulers, and I knew it not. They have made themselves idols of their silver and their gold, that they may be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He has cast off thy calf, O Samaria. MY anger is kindled against them. How long will it be ere they attain to innocence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For even this is from Israel: the workman made it, and it is no God. Yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. He has no standing grain. The blade shall yield no meal. If so be it yields, strangers shall swallow it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Israel is swallowed up. They are now among the nations as a vessel in which no man delights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they have gone up to Assyria [like] a wild donkey alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, though they hire among the nations, I will now gather them, and they shall begin to be diminished because of the burden of the king of rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been to him for sinning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law, but they are counted as a strange thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it, but LORD does not accept them. He will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. They shall return to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For Israel has forgotten his maker, and built palaces. And Judah has multiplied fortified cities. But I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
