For they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the troop of robbers ravages outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. Now their own doings have surrounded them; they are before my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the rulers with their lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They are all adulterers. They are as an oven heated by the baker. He ceases to stir [the fire], from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>On the day of our king the rulers made themselves sick with the heat of wine. He stretched out his hand with scoffers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For they have made their heart ready like an oven, while they lay in wait. Their baker sleeps all the night. In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings are fallen. There is none among those who call to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ephraim, he mixes himself among the peoples. Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he does not know. Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he does not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. Yet they have not returned to LORD their God, nor sought him for all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding. They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them. I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens. I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to them! For they have wandered from me. Destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me. Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they have not cried to me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and new wine. They rebel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they devise mischief against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They return, but not to [him] on high. They are like a deceitful bow. Their rulers shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
