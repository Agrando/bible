He takes away the first, so that he may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By which will we are sanctified through the one time offering of the body of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And indeed every priest stands daily serving and offering the same sacrifices often, which can never take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But this man, having offered one sacrifice on behalf of sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>waiting henceforth until his enemies are placed a footstool of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering he has fully perfected forever those being sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, after indeed foretelling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the covenant that I will ordain with them after those days, says Lord, giving my laws on their hearts, and on their minds I will write them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and, Their sins and their lawlessness I will, no, not further remember.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now where there is remission of these, there is no more offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entrance into the holy things by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>which he inaugurated for us, a new and living way through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and a great priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us approach with a TRUE heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body washed in pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold firm the affirmation of the hope unwavering, for he who promised is faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let us examine each other for provocation of love and good works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Not forsaking the assembling together of ourselves, as is the habit of some, but exhorting, and so much the more as long as ye see the day approaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For when we sin willfully after taking the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and of fire, a fervor that is going to devour the opposition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Any man who has disregarded the law of Moses dies without mercies from two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By how much worse punishment do ye think he will deserve who has trampled the Son of God, and who considered profane the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who treated the Spirit of grace contemptuously?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know him who said, Vengeance is for me, I will repay, says Lord. And again, Lord will judge his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But remember the former days, in which, after being enlightened, ye endured a great contest of sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Partly made a spectacle, both by reviling and afflictions, and partly having become companions of those so treated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For ye were both compassionate about my bonds, and ye accepted with joy the plundering of your possessions, knowing yourselves to have a superior and an enduring existence in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore do not throw off your boldness, which has great recompense of reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For ye have need of perseverance, so that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yet a very little while, he who is coming will come, and will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the righteous man will live from faith, and if he should withdraw, my soul is not pleased with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of retreat for destruction, but of faith for the preservation of the soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
