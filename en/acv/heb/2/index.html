Which first, having taken to be spoken by the Lord, was verified for us by those who heard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>God also testifying simultaneously by signs and wonders, and by various powers and distributions of Holy Spirit according to his will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he did not subject the coming world to heavenly agents, about which we speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But a certain man has somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that thou remember him? Or a son of man, that thou help him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou made him a little something less than the heavenly agents. Thou crowned him with glory and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thou subordinated all things under his feet. For in subordinating all things to him, he left nothing not subordinate to him. But now we do not yet see all things subordinated to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see Jesus who has been made a little something less than the heavenly agents, who, because of the suffering of death, has been crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God he would taste of death for every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was fitting for him, through whom are all things, and because of whom are all things, having brought many sons to glory, to make the pathfinder of their salvation fully perfect through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both he who sanctifies and those being sanctified are all of one, because of which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, I will declare thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, I will be a man who has trusted in him. And again, Behold, I and the children that God has given me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since therefore the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might make him who has the power of death impotent, that is, the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he might liberate these, as many as throughout all their lifetime were deserving of bondage, with a specter of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he certainly did not embrace heavenly agents, but he embraced the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in accordance with all things, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things toward God, in order to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in that he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help those being tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
