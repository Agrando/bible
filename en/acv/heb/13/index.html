What will man do to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember those who lead you, men who spoke the word of God to you, of whom, carefully observing the outcome of their conduct, imitate the faith--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today, and into the ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be not carried away by various and foreign doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established with grace, not with foods by which those who walked were not benefited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have an altar from which they have no right to eat, those officiating at the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For of the beasts whose blood is brought into the holy things for sin by the high priest, the bodies of these are burned outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore Jesus also, so that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us therefore go forth to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For here we have no enduring city, but we seek that which is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Through him therefore, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, fruit of lips acknowledging his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But do not forget benevolence and fellowship, for God is well pleased with such sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have confidence in those who lead you, and yield yourselves, for they watch for your souls as men who will render account, so that they may do this with joy, and not groaning, for this is unprofitable for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray about us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, desiring to behave well in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I urge you to do this even more, so that I may be restored to you sooner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep by the blood of an eternal covenant--our Lord Jesus--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>may he make you fully qualified in every good work in order to do his will, doing in you what is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I urge you, brothers, bear with the word of exhortation, for I also wrote to you in brief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Know ye, brother Timothy who was set free is with whom I will see you, if he comes sooner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Salute all those who lead you, and all the sanctified. The men from Italy salute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Grace is with you all. Truly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
