But now once, at the end of the ages, he was made known for an annulment of sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this, judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so also the Christ, having been offered once in order to take up the sins of many, will appear a second time, independent of sin, to those waiting for him for salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
