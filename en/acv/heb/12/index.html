And he whips every son whom he receives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because of chastening ye endure; God is treating you as with sons, for what son is there whom a father does not chasten?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if ye are without chastening, of which all have become participants, then ye are bastards, and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Besides, we indeed have had chastisers--the fathers of our flesh--and we were turned around. Shall we not much more be subordinate to the Father of the spirits, and we will live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For those men indeed for a few days chastened us according to that which seemed good to them, but he for that which is advantageous, in order to be partakers of his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But of course no chastening for the present seems to be of joy but of sorrow, yet afterward it yields peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore lift up the drooping hands, and the feeble knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be turned away, but may be healed instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Looking carefully lest any man fall short, away from the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness sprouting up would cause trouble, and by this many may be defiled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest a fornicator or profane man like Esau, who, in place of one meal sold his birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For ye also know that wanting afterward to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though having sought it with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For ye have not come to a mountain being felt, and which burned with fire, and to darkness, and gloom, and a tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of words, of which those who heard begged that a word not be added to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they did not bear that which was commanded, if even a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so fearful was that which was made visible, that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But ye have come to mount Zion, and to the city of a living God, a heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of heavenly agents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to a festal gathering and assembly of firstborn sons who were enrolled in the heavens, and to God, a Judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men who were made fully perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus a mediator of a new covenant, and to blood of sprinkling that speaks better than Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Watch, that ye not refuse him who speaks. For if those men did not escape, having refused him who spoke a divine message on earth, much more we, those who turn away from him from the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice then shook the earth. But now he has promised, saying, Yet once, I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the, Yet once, signifies the removal of the things being shaken--as of things that were made--so that the things not being shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, receiving an immovable kingdom, we may have grace, through which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and awe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For our God is also a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
