Walk as children of light</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>proving what is acceptable to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead even rebuke them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is disgusting even to speak of the things happening by them secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all things exposed are revealed by the light, for everything that is seen is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore he says, Awake, thou who sleep. And arise from the dead, and the Christ will shine upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore watch carefully how ye walk, not as unwise but as wise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of this do not become foolish, but understanding what is the will of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And do not become intoxicated with wine, during which is debauchery, but be filled in Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and striking strings in your heart to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>expressing thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>submitting yourselves to each other in the fear of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because a husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church, and himself the savior of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But as the church is subject to the Christ, so also the wives to their own husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your own wives even as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it with the washing of water by the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>so that he might present it to himself, the glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and unblemished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ the church,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because we are parts of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Separate from this a man will leave his father and mother behind, and will be bonded with his wife, and the two will be in one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This mystery is great, but I speak for Christ and for the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless ye also, each one in particular, shall so love his own wife as himself, and the wife that she fear her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
