Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble. For the day of LORD comes, for it is near at hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spreads upon the mountains, a great people and a strong, there has not ever been the like, nor shall be any more after them, even to the years of man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A fire devours before them, and behind them a flame burns. The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness. Yea, and none has escaped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses, and as horsemen, so do they run.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They leap like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces have grown pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They run like mighty men. They climb the wall like men of war, and they march each one on his ways. And they do not break their ranks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neither does one push another. They march each one in his path, and they burst through the weapons, and do not break off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They leap upon the city. They run upon the wall. They climb up into the houses. They enter in at the windows like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The earth quakes before them. The heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And LORD utters his voice before his army, for his camp is very great. For he is strong who executes his word. For the day of LORD is great and very fearful, and who can abide it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet even now, says LORD, turn ye to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to LORD your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and relents of the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who knows whether he will not turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering to LORD your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blow the trumpet in Zion. Sanctify a fast. Call a solemn assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gather the people. Sanctify the assembly. Assemble the old men. Gather the sons, and those who suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests, the ministers of LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and do not give thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then LORD was jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And LORD answered and said to his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith. And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I will remove the northern [army] far off from you, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its rear part into the western sea. And its stench shall come up, and its foul odor s</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fear not, O land. Be glad and rejoice, for LORD has done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness spring, for the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and the vine yield their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be glad then, ye sons of Zion, and rejoice in LORD your God, for he gives you the former rain in just measure, and he causes the rain to come down for you, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first [month].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will restore to you the years that the locust, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm has eaten--my great army which I sent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. And shall praise the name of LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am LORD your God, and there is none else. And my people shall never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also I will pour out my Spirit upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and wonderful (LXX/NT) day of LORD comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of LORD shall be saved. For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as LORD has said, and among the remnant those whom LORD calls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
