Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Judah went up, and LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [scraps] under my table. As I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir.
