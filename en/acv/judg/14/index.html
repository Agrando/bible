Now therefore get her for me to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brothers, or among all my people, that thou go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her fo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of LORD, for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Samson went down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. And, behold, a young lion roared against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Spirit of LORD came mightily upon him, and he tore him apart as he would have torn a kid, and he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And after a while he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his father went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there, for so the young men used to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you. If ye can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but if ye cannot declare it to me, then ye shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said to him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire.
