And she brought him into her father's house, and when the father of the damsel saw him, he</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him, and he abode with him three days. So they ate and drank, and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart. And the damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they sat down, and ate and drank, both of them together. And the damsel's father said to the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the man rose up to depart, but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart. And the damsel's father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declines. And they ate, both of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you tarry all night. Behold, the day grows to an end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came opposite Jebus (the same is Jerusalem). And there were with him a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine was also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent, and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his master said to him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner that is not of the sons of Israel, but we will pass over to Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places, and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And he went in, and sat down in the street of the city, for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening. Now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city. And the old man said, Where do thou go? And from where do thou come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem-judah. And I am [now] going to the house of LORD, and there is no man that takes m</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys, and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man who is with thy servants. There is no want of anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the old man said, Peace be to thee. However let all thy wants lay upon me, only do not lodge in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door. And they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who ca</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, I pray you, do not so wickedly, seeing that this man has come into my house. Do not this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine. I will bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seems good to you, but to this man do not any such folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men would not hearken to him. So the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them. And they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning, and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way, and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to her, Up, and let us be going, but there was no answering. Then he took her up upon the donkey, and the man rose up, and got to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he came into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the sons of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel, and speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
