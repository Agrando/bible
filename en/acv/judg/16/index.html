And the ambushment was abiding in the inner chamber. And he broke them off his arms like a thread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Delilah said to Samson, Until now thou have mocked me, and told me lies. Tell me with what thou might be bound. And he said to her, If thou weave the seven locks of my head with the web.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.

Thou have mocked me these three times, and have not told me with what thy great strength lays.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb.

And there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, who beheld while Samson made sport.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samson called to LORD, and said, O lord LORD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might, and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were in it.
