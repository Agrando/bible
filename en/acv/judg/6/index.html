And because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the sons of the east, they came up against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come to Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For they came up with their cattle and their tents. They came in as locusts for multitude. Both they and their camels were without number, and they came into the land to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass, when the sons of Israel cried to LORD because of Midian,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>that LORD sent a prophet to the sons of Israel. And he said to them, Thus says LORD, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I said to you, I am LORD your God. Ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell, but ye have not hearkened to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the agent of LORD came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite. And his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the agent of LORD appeared to him, and said to him, LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if LORD is with us, then why has all this befallen us? And where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not LORD bring us up from Egypt? But now LORD has cast us of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to him, Oh, LORD, with what shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And LORD said to him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shall smite the Midianites as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou who talk with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Depart not from here, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal. He put the flesh in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the agent of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the agent of LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the agent of L</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Gideon saw that he was the agent of LORD. And Gideon said, Alas, O lord LORD! Inasmuch as I have seen the agent of LORD face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And LORD said to him, Peace be to thee. Fear not; thou shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Gideon built an altar there to LORD, and called it LORD-shalom. To this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass the same night, that LORD said to him, Take thy father's bullock, even the second bullock seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And build an altar to LORD thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shall cut down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as LORD had spoken to him. And it came to pass, because he feared his father's household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joash said to all who stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? Or will ye save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death while [it is] morning. If he be a god, let him contend for himself because he has brok</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him because he has broken down his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled themselves together. And they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Spirit of LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, and Abiezer was gathered together after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they also were gathered together after him. And he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Gideon said to God, If thou will save Israel by my hand, as thou have spoken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor. If there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then I shall know that thou will save Israel by my hand as thou have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it was so, for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gideon said to God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And God did so that night, for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
