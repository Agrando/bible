And he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber, but her father would not allow him to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And her father said, I truly thought that thou had utterly hated her, therefore I gave her to thy companion. Is not her younger sister fairer than she? Take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Samson said to them, This time I shall be blameless in regard of the Philistines when I do them a mischief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Samson said to them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men of Judah said, Why have ye come up against us? And they said, We come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Know thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that thou have done to us? And he said to them, As they did t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said to him, We have come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they spoke to him, saying, No, but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand, but truly we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. And the Spirit of LORD came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I have smitten a thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he was very thirsty, and called on LORD, and said, Thou have given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant, and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out there. And when he had drunk his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
