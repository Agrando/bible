And he said, I made you go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers. And I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. Ye shall break down their altars. But ye have not hearkened to my voice. Why have ye done this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, when the agent of LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the sons of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the people served LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of LORD that he had wrought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers.

And they provoked LORD t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they forsook LORD, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the anger of LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them.
