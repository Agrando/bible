And he went out to war, and LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of LORD. And LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel because they had done that which was evil in the sight of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the sons of Israel cried to LORD, LORD raised up for them a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ehud made for himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length. And he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the men who bore the tribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all who stood by him went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ehud came to him. And he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose out of his seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his body, and it came out behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when he was gone out, his servants came, and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked. And they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they delayed till they were ashamed, and, behold, he did not open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key, and opened, and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when he came, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim. And the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, Follow after me, for LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and did not allow a man to pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they smote about ten thousand men of Moab at that time, every robust man, and every man of valor, and there escaped not a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox-goad, and he also saved Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
