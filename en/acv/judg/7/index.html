And the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And LORD said to Gideon, The people who are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty-two thousand, and there remained ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And LORD said to Gideon, The people are yet too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there. And it shall be, that of whom I say to thee, This man shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee, and of w</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he brought down the people to the water. And LORD said to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him thou shall set by himself. Likewise everyone who bows down upon his knees to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men, but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand. And let all the people go every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the people took provision in their hand, and their trumpets. And he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass the same night, that LORD said to him, Arise, get thee down into the camp, for I have delivered it into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thou shall hear what they say, and afterward thy hands shall be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude, and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Gideon came, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. And he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream. And, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and smote it so that it fel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else except the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. Into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation of it, that he worshipped. And he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise, for LORD has delivered the army of Midian into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put trumpets into the hands of all of them, and empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise, and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so ye shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For LORD and for Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch when they had but newly set the watch. And they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow. And they cried out, The sword of LORD and of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp. And all the army ran, and they shouted, and put [them] to flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb.
