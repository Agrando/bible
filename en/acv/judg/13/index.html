And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. And he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the agent of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him from where he was, neither did he tell me his name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but he said to me, Behold, thou shall conceive, and bear a son. And now drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Manoah entreated LORD, and said, Oh, LORD, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou sent come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah, and the agent of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me the [other] day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are thou the man who spoke to the woman? And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. What shall be the ordering of the child, and [what] shall we do to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the agent of LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Manoah said to the agent of LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the agent of LORD said to Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread, and if thou will make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it to LORD. For Manoah did not know that he was the agent of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Manoah said to the agent of LORD, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the agent of LORD said to him, Why do thou ask after my name, seeing it is wonderful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock to LORD. And [the heavenly agent] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the agent of LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on, and they fell on their faces to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the agent of LORD appeared no more to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the agent of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his wife said to him, If LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things a</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and LORD blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Spirit of LORD began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
