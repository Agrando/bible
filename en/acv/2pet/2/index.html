Reckless, self-willed men, they do not tremble when speaking evil of dignities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whereas heavenly agents, being greater in might and power, do not bring a railing judgment against them before Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these men, like irrational beasts of nature, having been born for capture and destruction, speaking evil at which things they do not understand, will be destroyed in their corruption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>getting back a wage of unrighteousness. Men who consider soft living in the daytime to be pleasure, spots and blemishes reveling in their deceitfulness, feasting together with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>having eyes full of adultery, and unceasing sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, children of a curse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>having forsaked a straight path, they were led astray, men who followed the way of Balaam, son of Beor, who loved the wage of unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he had a rebuke of his own lawbreaking. A mute donkey, uttering in a man's voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These men are waterless wells, and clouds driven by a fierce wind, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved into an age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, uttering swollen things of vanity, they entice (to sensuality by lusts of flesh) those who actually escaped from those who live in error,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>promising them freedom, while they themselves are bondmen of corruption, for by what any man has been overcome, of this he has also been enslaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if, having escaped the defilements of the world by knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and, having been again entangled in these, they are overcome, the last things have become worse for them than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But that of the TRUE proverb has happened to them, The dog returning to his own vomit, and the sow that washed to wallowing in mire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
