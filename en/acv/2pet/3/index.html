For, from since the fathers became asleep, all things continue this way from the beginning of creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this is willfully ignored by them, that long ago there were heavens, and an earth that came together out of water and by water by the word of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>by which the world then perished, having been overflowed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But now the heavens and the earth, which have been stored up by the same word, are being preserved for fire in a day of judgment and destruction of irreverent men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But beloved, this one thing you should not ignore, that one day with Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord is not slack about his promise, as some regard slackness, but is patient toward us, not wanting any to perish, but all to go forward to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the day of Lord will come as a thief in the night, during which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, being intensely hot, will be disintegrated, and the earth and the works in it will be destroyed by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, all these things being disintegrated, what kind ought ye to be in holy actions and pieties,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>anticipating and hastening the coming of the day of God, by which the heavens, being made fiery hot, will be disintegrated, and the elements dissolve, being intensely hot?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we anticipate a new heavens and a new earth according to his promise, in which righteousness dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, beloved, anticipating these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, without spot and blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And consider the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation, just as also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist, as also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye therefore, beloved, knowing in advance, keep watch, lest, having accommodated to the error of the lawless, ye fall from your own steadfastness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
