Do not the rich exploit you, and they themselves drag you into courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they not blaspheme the good name that was called upon you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If ye indeed fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if ye respect personages, ye work sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever keeps the whole law, and stumbles on one, he has become guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said thou shall not commit adultery, also said thou shall not murder. Now if thou will not commit adultery, but murder, thou have become a transgressor of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak ye, and so do ye, as men who are to be judged by a law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the judgment is merciless to him who did no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is the benefit, my brothers, if some man should say to have faith, but has no works? Can the faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if a brother or sister may be unclothed, and may be destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and some man of you would say to them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and fed, but ye would not give them the things necessary for the body, what is the benefit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So also faith, if it has no works, is dead by itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But some man will say, Thou have faith, and I have works. Show me thy faith from thy works, and I will show thee from my works my faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou believe that there is one God, thou do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But do thou want to know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father made righteous from works, having offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou see that faith was working with his works, and from the works, faith was fully perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness, and he was called a friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye see therefore that from works a man is made righteous, and not from faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And likewise also was not Rahab the harlot made righteous from works, having received the agents, and having sent them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without a spirit is dead, so also faith without the works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
