And the flower of it fell, and the beauty of its appearance perished. So also the rich man will fade away among his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is a man who endures temptation, because, having become approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God, for God is without temptation of evils, and he himself tempts no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But each man is tempted by his own lust, being drawn away and enticed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the lust having conceived, it gives birth to sin, and after being complete the sin brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not led astray, my beloved brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect endowment is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation nor shadow of turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Having deliberated, he begot us by the word of truth for us to be a certain first fruit of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore having put off all filthiness and profusion of evil, receive with mildness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But become ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this resembles a man observing his natural face in a mirror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he observes himself, and goes away, and straightaway forgets what kind of man he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he who stooped to look into the perfect law, the one of liberty, and who remained, this man, who did not become a forgetful hearer but a doer of work, this man will be blessed in his doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man among you seems to be religious, not bridling his tongue but deceiving his heart, this man's religion is futile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure religion and undefiled from God and the Father is this, to go help the orphaned and the widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
