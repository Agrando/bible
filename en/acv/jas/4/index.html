Is it not from here: from your pleasures warring in your body-parts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ye desire and do not have, so ye murder. And ye envy and cannot obtain, so ye fight and make war. Ye do not have, because ye do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ye ask, and do not receive, because ye ask wrongly, so that ye may spend on your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is hatred of God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or think ye that the scripture says vainly, The spirit that he caused to dwell in us yearns with jealousy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, God is opposed to the arrogant, but gives grace to the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be subordinate therefore to God, but resist the devil and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Approach God and he will approach you. Cleanse the hands, ye sinners, and purify the hearts, ye double-minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be ye sorrowful, and mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into a downcast look.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be ye made lower in the sight of the Lord, and he will lift you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Speak not against each other, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against law and judges law. But if thou judge law, thou are not a doer of law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy, but thou, who are thou who judge the other man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go now, men who say, Today and tomorrow we will go into this city, and will operate one year there, and will engage in trade and will get gain--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>men who know not of the morrow. For what is your life? For it will be a vapor that appears for a little while, and then also vanishes away--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>in place of your saying, If the Lord should will, then we will live and do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now ye boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He therefore who knows to do good, and is not doing it, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
