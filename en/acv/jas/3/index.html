If any man does not stumble in word, this is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold we put bits into the mouths of horses for them to obey us, and we guide about their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the ships, being so great and driven by fierce winds, are guided about by a very small rudder, wherever the impulse of the man who steers determines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So also the tongue is a little body-part, and boasts greatly. Behold a little fire, how much wood it kindles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, the world of unrighteousness. Thus, the tongue is made to lead among our body-parts, defiling the whole body, and setting the cycle of nature on fire, and being set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every species, both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the human species.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But no man is able to tame the tongue of men, an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By it we bless the God and Father, and by it we curse men, who were made according to a likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and curse. My brothers, these things ought not to happen this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does the spring pour out from the same opening the sweet and the bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A fig tree, my brothers, cannot make olives, or a grapevine figs. In the same way, no one spring makes water salty and sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show from his good behavior his works in mildness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast, and do not lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not descending from above, but is earthly, world-soul, demonic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where envy and selfish ambition are, there is instability and every evil deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom from above is indeed first pure, then peaceful, meek, easily entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and non-hypocritical.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace to those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
