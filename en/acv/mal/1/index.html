Yet ye say, How have thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother, says LORD. Yet I loved Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but Esau I regarded inferior, and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places, thus says LORD of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down, and men shall call them the border of wickedness, and the people against whom L</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, LORD be magnified beyond the border of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? says LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. And ye say, How have we despised thy na</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar. And ye say, How have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of LORD is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, [ye say,] It is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, It is no evil!

For my name [is] great among the Gentiles, says LORD</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of LORD is polluted. And the fruit of it, even its food, is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye also say, Behold, what a weariness it is! And ye have sniffed at it, says LORD of hosts. And ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick. Thus ye bring the offering.
