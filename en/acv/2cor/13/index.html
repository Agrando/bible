In the mouth of two witnesses or three every saying will be confirmed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have told you before, and I say in advance, as present the second time, and now absent, I write to those who have previously sinned, and to all the others, that if I come to it again, I will not spare,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>since ye seek proof of the Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is mighty in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For even if he was crucified from weakness, yet he lives from the power of God. For we in him are also weak, but we will live with him from the power of God toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Examine yourselves whether ye are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless ye are test-failing something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I hope that ye will know that we are not test-failing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now I pray to God, to do you nothing harmful, not that we would appear test-passing, but that ye would do right, even like we might be test-failing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For we do not have any power against the truth, but for the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong. And this also we pray for, your full qualification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because of this I write these things while absent, so that I may not act harshly when present, according to the authority that the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally brothers, farewell. Be thoroughly prepared, be encouraged, think the same way, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Salute each other by a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the sanctified salute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, is with all of you. Truly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
