If any man has convinced himself to be of Christ, let him consider this again of himself, that, as he is of Christ, so also are we of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I also should boast somewhat more abundantly about our authority (which the Lord gave us for building up, and not for tearing you down), I will not be shamed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>so that I would not seem as if to terrify you by the letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because, The letters, he says, are indeed weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is disdained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a man think this, that such kind we are in word by letters when absent, we are also such kind when present in the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we dare not classify or compare ourselves to some of those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, do not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not boast in things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the standard that God apportioned to us, of a measure to reach even as far as you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is not as not reaching for you. We overextend ourselves. For we even reached as far as you in the good-news of the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>not boasting in things immeasurable, in other men's labors, but having hope of your faith growing in you to be enlarged according to our measure for abundance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in order to preach the good-news beyond you, not to boast in another measure, in things prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who boasts should boast in Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he who commends himself, that man is not approved, but whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
