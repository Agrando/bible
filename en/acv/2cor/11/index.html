For I betrothed you to one husband, a pure virgin to present to the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent enticed Eve by his craftiness, so your thoughts might be corrupted from the simplicity in the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For indeed if a man who comes, preaches another Jesus whom we did not preach, or ye receive another spirit that ye did not receive, or another good-news that ye did not accept, ye well tolerated it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For I reckon to come short in nothing of those, superlative apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge, but in everything made known in all things to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Or did I commit a sin lowering myself so that ye might be lifted up, because I preached to you the good-news of God freely?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I robbed other congregations, having taken a wage in order for your service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And being present with you, and when needy, I was a burden to no man. For the brothers who came from Macedonia, they supplied my need. And in everything I kept, and I will keep myself non-burdensome to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The truth of Christ is in me that this pride in me will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, I also will do, so that I may cut off the opportunity of those who desire an opportunity, that in what they boast, they might appear just as we also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such men are FALSE apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves into apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no marvel, for even Satan disguises himself into an agent of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, it is no great thing if his helpers also disguise themselves as helpers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, let not any man think me to be foolish, but if otherwise--even if as foolish--accept me, so that I also may boast some a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I speak, I speak not according to Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of the boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For being wise, ye gladly tolerate the foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye tolerate it if some man enslaves you, if some man devours you, if some man seizes you, if some man lifts himself up, if some man strikes you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak as from shame, that we were so weak. Yet in whatever any man may be bold in foolishness, I say I too am bold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? I too. Are they Israelites? I too. Are they a seed of Abraham? I too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they helpers of Christ? (I speak as being mad) I more: in toils, more abundantly; in stripes, countless; in prisons, more frequently; in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From the Jews five times I received forty save one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I was shipwrecked, I have done a night and a day in the depth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in frequent journeys, in perils of flowing waters, in perils of bandits, in perils from my race, in perils from Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils at sea, in perils among FALSE brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in toil and hardship, in frequent sleeplessness, in hunger and thirst, in frequent fasts, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides the external things, crowding upon me daily is the care of all the congregations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I am not made fiery?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If it is necessary to boast, I will boast of the things of my weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed into the ages, knows that I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes wanting to apprehend me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I was lowered in a hamper through a window through the wall, and escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
