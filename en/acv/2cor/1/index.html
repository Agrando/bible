And I hope ye will also acknowledge until the end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as also ye did acknowledge us in part, because we are your boast, just as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in this confidence I intended to come to you earlier, so that ye might have a second benefit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and to pass through you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be helped on the way toward Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore intending this, did I accordingly employ anything in lightness? Or what I decide, do I decide according to flesh, so that it would be with me the yes, yes and the no, no?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But God is faithful, because our word toward you became not, yes and no.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was proclaimed among you by us (by me and Silvanus and Timothy) became not, yes and no, but in him has become, yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For as many as be promises of God, in him is the Yes, and in him the Truly, for glory to God through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and who anointed us, is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He also is who put a seal on us, and who gave the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that I did not yet come to Corinth, sparing you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not because we lord over your faith, but are co-workmen of your joy, for by faith ye stand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
