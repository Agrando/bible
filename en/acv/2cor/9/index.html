And your zeal provoked the majority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But I sent the brothers so that our boast about you would not be empty in this regard. So that, as I said, ye may be prepared,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>if somehow Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we (that we might not say, ye) would be embarrassed in this confidence of boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers that they would go ahead to you, and arrange in advance your gift that was earlier announced, for this to be ready this way as a gift and not as an exaction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows in blessings will also reap in blessings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Each man as he purposes in his heart, not from regret or from necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God is able to abound all grace for you, so that always in everything having all sufficiency, ye may abound for every good work,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as it is written, He has scattered abroad. He has given to the poor. His righteousness endures into the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he who supplies seed to the man who sows, and bread for eating, may he supply and multiply your seed, and may he increase the fruits of your righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>being enriched in everything for every generosity, which works gratitude to God through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the sanctified, but also abounding through many thanksgivings to God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>through the evidence of this service, glorifying God at the subjection of your confession toward the good-news of the Christ, and at the generosity of the participation, for them and for all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and by their supplication about you, yearning for you because of the transcending grace of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thanks to God for his indescribable gift.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
