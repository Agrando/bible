For I also, whom I have forgiven (if anything), I have forgiven because of you in the presence of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so that we may not be exploited by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his methods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now having come to Troas for the good-news of the Christ, and a door having been opened to me in Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I had no rest in my spirit, my not finding Titus my brother. But having departed from them, I went forth into Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thanks is to God who always causes us to triumph in the Christ, and who makes manifest the aroma of the knowledge of him in every place, through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because we are a fragrance of Christ to God, in those being saved and in those perishing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to the one an odor of death for death, and to the other an aroma of life for life. And who is adequate for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we are not as other men, huckstering the word of God, but as from purity. But we speak in Christ as from God in the sight of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
