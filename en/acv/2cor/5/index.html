But we have been manifested to God, and I hope also to have been manifested in your consciences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we are not commending ourselves again to you, but giving you an opportunity of boasting about us, so that ye may have for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For whether we are beside ourselves to God, or we are of normal mind, it is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the love of Christ holds us together, having judge this, that if one died for all, then all died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he died for all so that those who live would no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and was raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So that henceforth we know no man according to flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away, behold, all things have become new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and who gave to us the ministry of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We are therefore, ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were calling through us. We plead on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the man who knew no sin was made sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
