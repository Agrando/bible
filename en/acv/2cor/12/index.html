For I will come to visions and revelations of Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in body, I know not, or whether outside the body, I know not, God knows) such a man was caught up as far as the third heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I know such a man (whether in body, or whether outside the body, I know not, God knows)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that he was caught up into the paradise, and heard inexpressible sayings that are not permitted for a man to utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For such a man I will boast, but for myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For if I should want to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth. But I refrain lest any man should reckon to me above what he sees of me or hears anything from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And so that I might not be over exalted by the extraordinariness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an agent of Satan so that he would buffet me, so that I would not be over exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I besought the Lord thrice about this, that it might depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is made fully perfect in weakness. More gladly therefore I will boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of the Christ may reside in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I am pleased in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in restrictions, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become foolish, boasting. Ye compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I came short in nothing of those, superlative apostles, even though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Indeed the signs of the apostle were performed among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is there which ye were inferior to the other congregations? Except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, a third time I fare readily to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you, for I seek not the things of you, but you. For the children ought not lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I most gladly will spend, and will be spent for your souls. Even though more earnestly loving you, the worse I am loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But let it be. I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being clever, I caught you with bait.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Any man of whom I have sent to you, did I exploit you through him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I encouraged Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus exploit you in anything? Did we not walk in the same spirit, not in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, do ye think that we are making defense to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear lest somehow, having come, I may find you not such as I want, and I may be found by you such as ye do not want, lest somehow there be strifes, envyings, wraths, selfish ambitions, slanderings, whisperings, puffings up, t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>lest having come again my God will make me low toward you, and I will bewail many of those who have sinned previously, and who did not repent from the trash and fornication and licentiousness that they committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
