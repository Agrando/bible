Behold, now is an acceptable time. Behold, now is a day of salvation),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>giving not one cause of stumbling in anything, so that the ministry may not be criticized,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but in everything commending ourselves as helpers of God, in much perseverance, in afflictions, in necessities, in restrictions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hungerings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in Holy Spirit, in non-hypocritical love,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>in word of truth, in power of God, through the weapons of righteousness of the right hand and of the left,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>through glory and disrepute, through slander and commendation; as deceitful, and yet true;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as grieving, but always rejoicing; as poor, but making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Corinthians, our mouth has been opened to you, our heart has been enlarged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ye are not limited in us, but ye are limited in your bowels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I speak the same recompense as to children, be ye also enlarged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness?
