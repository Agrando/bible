And the voice that I heard was as of harpers harping with their harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four beings and the elders. And none could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, those who have been redeemed from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are men who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were out of men purchased by Jesus, a first fruit to God and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And no lie was found in their mouth, for they are unblemished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw an agent flying in mid-heaven having eternal good-news to proclaim to those who sit on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying in a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. And worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and springs of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another, a second agent, followed, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen. She has given all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And another agent, a third, followed them, saying in a great voice, If any man worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he also himself will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which was mixed undiluted in the cup of his anger. And he will be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy agents and before the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment ascends into the ages of ages. And they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and its image, and if any man receives the mark of its name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the perseverance of the sanctified. Here are those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in Lord from henceforth. Yea, says the Spirit, so that they may rest from their toils, and their works follow with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I looked, and behold, a white cloud. And sitting upon the cloud, like a son of man, having a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another agent came out from the temple, crying out in a great voice to him who sits on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle and reap, because the hour has come to reap, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he who sits on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another agent came out from the temple in heaven, also himself having a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another agent came out from the altar having power over the fire. And he cried out in a great shout to him who has the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the grapevine of the earth, be</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the agent sent his sickle to the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out from the winepress, up to the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
