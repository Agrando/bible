And the smoke of her ascended into the ages of the ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the twenty-four elders and the four beings fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, Truly! Praise Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise ye our God, all his bondmen and those who fear him, the small and the great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard as the sound of a large multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Praise Lord! Because Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We should be glad and rejoice and give the glory to him, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has prepared herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was given her that she clothe herself in fine linen, bright and pure. For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he says to me, Write, Blessed are those who have been called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb.
