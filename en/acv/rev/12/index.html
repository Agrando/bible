A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars upon her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And having in her womb, she cried out, suffering birth pains, and suffering to give birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And another sign was seen in heaven. And behold, a great fiery dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his tail drags the third part of the stars of the sky, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was going to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she gave birth to a son, a male who was going to tend all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was taken up to God and to his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place there prepared by God, so that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred sixty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And war developed in heaven: Michael and his agents to fight with the dragon. And the dragon and his agents fought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he did not prevail, nor was a place found for him any more in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, called the Devil and Satan, he who leads the whole world astray. He was cast out to the earth, and his agents were cast out with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying, Now it came to pass, the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. Because the accuser of our brothers was cast out, who accuses them before</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony. And they loved not their life to the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rejoice because of this, O heavens, and ye who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place. So that she might be nourished there for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the serpent cast water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might make her carried away by the flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the earth helped the woman. And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon cast out of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the dragon was angry toward the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, those keeping the commandments of God, and having the testimony of Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
