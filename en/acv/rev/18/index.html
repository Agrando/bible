And the kings of the earth fornicated with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her wantonness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, so that ye may not participate with her sins, and that ye may not receive from her plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because her sins have reached as far as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Render to her as she also rendered to you, and double to her two-fold according to her works. In the cup that she mixed, mix two-fold for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In an amount she glorified herself and lived wantonly, give her so much torment and grief, because she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will, no, not see grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because of this her plagues will come in one day, death, and grief, and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, because strong is Lord, the God who judged her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the kings of the earth who fornicated and lived wantonly with her, will weep and will beat their breasts for her when they see the smoke of her burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>having stood from afar because of the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, Babylon, the mighty city! Because thy judgment has come in one hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her, because no man buys their merchandise any more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and mar</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and olive oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and sheep, and cattle, and horses, and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the fruit of the lust of thy soul have departed from thee. And all the fat and bright things are destroyed from thee.
