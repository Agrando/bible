And the key of the pit of the abyss was given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke ascended out of the pit, like smoke of a burning furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And locusts came forth out of the smoke upon the earth, and power was given to them, like the scorpions of the earth have power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it was told them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor anything green, nor any tree, except the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was given them that they would not kill them, but that they would be tormented five months. And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in those days men will seek death, and will, no, not find it. And they will long to die, and death will flee from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the likeness of the locusts was similar to horses prepared for battle. And upon their heads were like golden crowns, and their faces were as men's faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they have tails similar to scorpions, and stings. And in their tails they have power to hurt men five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Having a king over them, the agent of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One woe is departed, behold, two woes yet come after these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sixth agent sounded, and I heard a voice, one from the four horns of the golden altar before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying to the sixth agent who has the trumpet, Loose the four agents who have been bound at the great river Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the four agents were loosed, who were prepared for the hour and for the day and month and year, so that they would kill the third part of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the number of the armies of the horsemen was ten thousands of ten thousands. I heard the number of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sit on them having breastplates fiery red, and of hyacinth color, and sulphurous.
