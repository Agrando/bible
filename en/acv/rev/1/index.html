And he signified it, having sent by his agent to his bondman John</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things as he saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and who keep the things written in it, for the time is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John, to the seven congregations in Asia: Grace to you and peace from God, who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and washed us from our sins by his blood</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him is the glory and the dominion into the ages of the ages. Truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, he comes with the clouds and every eye will see him, even the men who pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail against him. Yea, Truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am the Alpha and the Omega, says Lord, the God who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I John, your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance in Christ Jesus, happened to be on the isle that is called Patmos because of the word of God, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I became in spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice like a trumpet</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>saying, What thou see, write in a book and send to the seven congregations: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I turned there to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in the midst of the seven lampstands, resembling a son of man, he who was clothed down to the foot, and girded about with a golden belt at the breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his head and hair were white as wool, white as snow, and his eyes as a flame of fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and his feet resembling highly refined metal, as in a furnace having been fiery hot, and his voice as the sound of many waters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and having in his right hand seven stars, and a sharp two-edged sword coming out of his mouth. And the sight of him was as the sun shines in its strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not, I am the first and the last,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he who lives. And I became dead, and behold, I am living into the ages of the ages. Truly. And I have the keys of death and of Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore write the things that thou saw, and things that are, and things that are going to happen after these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The mystery of the seven stars that thou saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are agents of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands that thou saw are the seven congregations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
