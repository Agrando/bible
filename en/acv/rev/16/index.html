And the men blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues, and they did not repent to give him glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the fifth agent poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast, and its kingdom became darkened, and they gnawed their tongues from the anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they blasphemed the God of heaven from their pains and from their sores. And they did not repent of their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sixth agent poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the sun-rising might be prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the FALSE prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they are spirits of demons, doing signs that go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together to the battle of that great day of the Almighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, so that he may not walk naked, and they see his shame.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he gathered them together into the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventh agent poured out his bowl upon the air, and a great voice came forth out of the temple of heaven, out of the throne, saying, It has come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there occurred lightnings, and thunders, and voices. And a great earthquake occurred, such as did not happen from that time men came to be upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, so great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the great city became in three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And the great Babylon was remembered before God, to give to it the cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And great hail, like a talent weight, descended out of the sky upon men. And the men blasphemed God from the plague of the hail, because the plague of it was exceedingly great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
