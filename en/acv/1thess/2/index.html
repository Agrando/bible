While able to bear down as apostles of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>nevertheless we became gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse cherishes her own children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus being desirous of you, we were pleased to impart to you, not only the good-news of God, but also our own souls, because ye have become beloved to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For ye remember, brothers, our labor and the hardship. For, laboring night and day in order not to burden any of you, we preached to you the good-news of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ye are witnesses, and God, how piously and justly and blamelessly we became to you who believe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>just as ye know, as each one of you as a father of his own children, imploring you, and comforting,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and solemnly declaring for you to walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And because of this we thank God without ceasing, because, having received the word of God heard from us, ye received not the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For ye, brothers, became imitators of the congregations of God, which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because ye also suffered the same things by your own countrymen, just as also they by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The men who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and who persecuted us, and are not pleasing to God, and are contrary to all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles so that they might be saved, in order to fill up their sins always. But wrath came upon them finally.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we, brothers, who were orphaned from you for the time of an hour, in presence not in heart, hastened more earnestly to see your face, with much desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore we wanted to come to you, indeed I, Paul, even once and again, and Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boast? Or is it not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye are our glory and joy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
