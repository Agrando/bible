But we exhort you, brothers, to abound more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and to aspire to live quietly, and to do your own things, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that ye may walk properly toward those outside, and may have nothing lacking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about those who are asleep, so that ye may not grieve, as also the others who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we believe that Jesus died and arose, so also those who became asleep through Jesus, God will bring with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this we say to you in the word of Lord, that we who are alive, who remain for the coming of the Lord, will no, not precede those who became asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of the arch-agent, and with a trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up simultaneously with them in clouds to the Lord's gathering in the air. And so we will always be with Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore encourage each other with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
