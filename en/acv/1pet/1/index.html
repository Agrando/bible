Since it is now necessary for a little while,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so that the proof of your faith, much more precious than gold that perishes, and though proven by fire, may be found for praise and esteem and for glory at the revealing of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whom, not having seen, ye love, in whom, not now seeing but believing, ye exult in inexpressible and glorified joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>receiving back the outcome of your faith, the salvation of souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>About which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently. Men who prophesied about the grace for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>searching for what, or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ in them indicated, predicting the sufferings in Christ, and the glories after these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom it was revealed, that they were serving not themselves, but you, those things that were now reported to you by those who preached good-news to you in Holy Spirit, which was sent forth from heaven, into which things heavenly</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope entirely for the grace brought to you at the revealing of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but according to the Holy Man, he who called you, ye yourselves also become holy in all conduct,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because it is written, Become ye holy, since I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if ye call on a Father, him who judges impartially according to each man's work, live the time of your sojourn in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Knowing that ye were redeemed from your vain behavior inherited from fathers, not with perishable silver or gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but by precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted--of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who was indeed foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in the last times because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Men who, because of him, believe in God who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, in order for your faith and hope to be in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Men who have purified your souls in obedience of the truth through the Spirit for non-hypocritical brotherly love. Ye should love each other fervently from a pure heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God that lives and remains into the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as a flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower of it falls away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but the word of Lord endures into the age.
