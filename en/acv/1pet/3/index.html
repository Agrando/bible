Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because the eyes of Lord are toward the righteous, and his ears to their supplication, but the face of Lord is against men who do evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And who is he who will harm you, if ye become imitators of the good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But even if ye should suffer because of righteousness, ye are blessed. But do not fear their terror nor be shaken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. And always be ready for a defense to every man who asks you a word about the hope in you, with mildness and fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Having a good conscience, so that, in what they speak against you as of evil-doers, they may be ashamed, those who revile your good behavior in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better to suffer doing good, if the will of God desires, than for doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because Christ also once suffered for sins, a righteous man for unrighteous men, so that he might bring you to God. Having indeed been killed in flesh, but made alive in spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which also, having gone, he preached to the spirits in prison</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who were disobedient formerly, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah who prepared an ark in which a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Which counterpart--immersion--now also saves us, not the putting away of filth of flesh, but an appeal of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, agents, and positions of authority, and powers having been subordinated to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
