And he who believes in him will, no, not be shamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To you therefore who believe is the preciousness, but for men who disobey, A stone that the builders rejected, this became the head of the corner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and, A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, men who stumble at the word, being disobedient, for which also they were set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But ye are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for an acquired possession, so that ye might broadly proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Men formerly not a people, but now are a people of God. Men who had not obtained mercy, but who now have obtained mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, I beseech you as aliens and sojourners, to abstain from the fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Having your behavior good among the Gentiles, so that, upon which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may glorify God in the day of visitation, from having observed your good works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore because of the Lord, ye should submit to every human establishment, whether to a king as being supreme,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governors as being sent by him for vengeance of evil-doers and praise of well-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because this way is the will of God, doing good to muzzle the ignorance of the foolish men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As free, and not having your freedom as a cover-up of evil, but as bondmen of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Respect all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Respect the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Household servants, submitting to the masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wayward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For this is graciousness, if, because of consciousness of God, any man endures sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what kind of credit is it, if, sinning and being beaten, ye will endure? But if, doing good and suffering, ye will endure, this is graciousness with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For ye were called for this. Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example, so that ye should follow his footsteps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who did no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, being reviled, did not revile in return. Suffering, he did not threaten, but yielded to him who judges righteously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who himself took up our sins in his body upon the tree, so that we, having died to sins, might live to the righteousness of him from whose wound ye were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For ye were like sheep going astray, but now were returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
