Therefore be serious, and be sober for the prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And above all having fervent love for yourselves, because love will cover a multitude of sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>stranger-loving toward each other without complaints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As each has received a gift, serving it for yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If any man speaks, as oracles of God. If any man serves, as of ability as God supplies. So that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the dominion into the ages of the ages. Truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Beloved, ye should not be surprised at the fieriness in you, which occurs for a trial to you, like a strange thing happening to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But rejoice in so far as ye are partakers in the sufferings of the Christ, so that also at the revealing of his glory ye may rejoice, having exceeding joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blessed are ye if ye are reviled for the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. From them he is indeed blasphemed, but from you he is glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For let not any man of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a busybody.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this regard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because the time to begin judgment is from the house of God, and if first from us, what is the end of those who disobey the good-news of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, where will the irreverent and sinful man appear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore also let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls as to a faithful Creator by well-doing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
