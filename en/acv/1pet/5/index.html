And all being subordinate to each other, clothe yourselves with humility, because God sets himself against the haughty, but gives grace to the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore be lowered under the mighty hand of God, so that he may lift you up in time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>having cast all your concern upon him, because he cares for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be sober, be vigilant. Your opponent the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about seeking whom to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whom resist, steadfast in the faith, knowing the same sufferings are to be accomplished in the world by your brotherhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And may the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus (after suffering a little while) himself thoroughly prepare you. He will establish, strengthen, and provide a foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To him is the glory and the dominion into the ages of the ages. Truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>By Silvanus, the faithful brother to you, as I reckon, I wrote because of a few things, exhorting and testifying this to be the TRUE grace of God in which ye stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>She in Babylon, chosen together, salutes you, and my son Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Salute each other by a kiss of love.
