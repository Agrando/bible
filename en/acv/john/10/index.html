And the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them. And the sheep follow him because they know his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they will, no, not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus spoke this allegory to them, but those men did not understand what it was that he spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, that I am the door of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All, as many as came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the door. If any man enters in by me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out, and will find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief comes not, except that he might steal and kill and destroy. I came so that they might have life, and have it more abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the hired man, and not being the shepherd, whose sheep are not his own, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees. And the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the hireling flees because he is a hireling, and it is no care to him about the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and I am known by mine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>just as the Father knows me, I also know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring those also, and they will hear my voice. And there will become one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, so that I may take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No man takes it from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore again there became a division among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them said, He has a demon, and is mad. Why do ye listen to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not the sayings of a man possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the feast of the dedication happened at Jerusalem, and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, When do thou lift up our soul? If thou are the Christ, tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye did not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give them eternal life, and they will, no, not perish into the age, and not any will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father who has given to me, is greater than all, and not one is able to snatch out of my Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore again the Jews took up stones so that they might stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from my Father. Because of them, which work do ye stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, saying, We stone thee not about a good work, but about blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, make thyself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he designated those men gods, for whom the word of God came to be (and the scripture cannot be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, do ye say, Thou blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I am doing them, even though ye do not believe me, believe the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they sought again to take him, and he went forth out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he departed again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was first immersing, and he stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to him, and they said, John indeed did not one sign, but all, as many things as John spoke about this man, were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
