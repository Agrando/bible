Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus took the loaves, and having expressed thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down, likewise also of the fishes as much as they wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain over, so that not anything may be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves that remained over from those who have eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When therefore the men saw what sign Jesus did, they said, This really is the prophet who comes into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus therefore having perceived that they are going to come and seize him, so that they might make him king, departed onto the mountain himself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when it became evening his disciples went down to the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and having entered into the boat, they were going to the other side of the sea toward Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sea was being raised by a great wind blowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore having impelled forward about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near to the boat, and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he says to them, It is I, fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat, and straightaway the boat came to be at the land to which they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other boat there except that one in which his disciples entered, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but his</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and other boats came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord expressed thanks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they entered into the boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did thou become here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Work not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for God the Father put a seal on this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They said to him therefore, What shall we do that we may work the works of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered, and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in that man whom he has sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They said to him therefore, What sign do thou, that we may see and believe in thee? What do thou work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the TRUE bread out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said to him therefore, Lord, always give us this bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will, no, not hunger, and he who believes in me will, no, not ever thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But also I said to you, that ye have seen me, and yet do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and he who comes to me I will, no, not cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Because I have come down from heaven, not so that I might do my will, but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all that he has given me I would not lose from it, but I will raise it up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And this is the will of him who sent me, that every man who sees the Son, and believes in him, may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews therefore murmured about him because he said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? Therefore how does this man say, I have come down out of heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No man can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophets, And they will all be taught of God. Every man who hears from the Father, and having learned, comes to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God. This man has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me has eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the living bread, having come down out of heaven. If any man eats of this bread, he will live into the age. And also, the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews therefore contended with each other, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, also he who eats me, that man will also live because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live into the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>He said these things in a synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Therefore many of his disciples having heard, said, This is a hard saying. Who can listen to it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples are grumbling about this, said to them, Does this cause you to stumble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then if ye should see the Son of man ascending where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the spirit that makes alive. The flesh benefits nothing. The sayings that I speak to you are spirit, are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Nevertheless, there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who do not believe, and who he is who will betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And he said, Because of this I have said to you that no man is able to come to me, if it is not given to him from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From this, many of his disciples went back at these things, and walked no more with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Jesus said therefore to the twelve, Do ye not also want to go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter therefore answered him, Lord, to whom will we go? Thou have sayings of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And we have believed and know that thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>But he spoke of Judas Iscariot son of Simon. For this man, being one of the twelve, was going to betray him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
