Therefore the first man who stepped in after the agitation of the water became well from whatever affliction he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a certain man was there who was thirty-eight years in the weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Jesus saw this man laying down, and knew that he fares now a long time, he says to him, Do thou desire to become well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The infirmed man answered him, Sir, I have no man so that when the water is agitated he might put me into the pool, but while I am coming another steps down before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy bed and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And straightaway the man became well, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was Sabbath on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Jews therefore said to the man who was cured, It is Sabbath. It is not permitted for thee to take up the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them, The man who made me well, that man said to me, Take up thy bed and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore they asked him, Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the man who was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus withdrew, a multitude being in the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou have become well. Sin no more, lest something worse may happen to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man departed and reported to the Jews that Jesus is the man who made him well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on a Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now and I work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because of this therefore the Jews sought even more to kill him, because not only did he relax the Sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever he may do, the Son also does these things in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. And he will show him works greater works than these, so that ye may marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raises up the dead and makes alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>so that all would honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. The man not honoring the Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, that he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life. And he does not come into condemnation, but has passed from death into life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, that an hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to the Son to have life in himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he also gave him authority to execute judgment because he is a son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Marvel not at this, because an hour comes in which all those in the sepulchers will hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and will come forth, those who have done right to a resurrection of life, and those who have practiced wrong to a resurrection of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can from myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge. And my judgment is righteous because I seek not my will, but the will of the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony that he testifies about me is valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I do not take the testimony from man. However, I say these things, so that ye may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That man was the lamp that burns and shines, and ye were willing to rejoice for an hour in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have testimony greater than of John, for the works that the Father has given me so that I might complete them, the same works that I do, they testify about me that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father, he who sent me, has testified about me.Ye have neither heard his voice, nor have ever seen his appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye have not his word dwelling in you, because ye do not believe that man whom he sent for this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Ye search the scriptures, because ye think to have eternal life in them, and those are testifying about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And ye will not come to me, so that ye may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I do not receive glory from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God within yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in my Father's name, and ye do not accept me. If another man should come in his own name, ye will accept that man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can ye believe, who receive glory from each other, and seek not the glory from the only God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. The man who accuses you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for that man wrote about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if ye believe not the writings of that man, how will ye believe my sayings?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
