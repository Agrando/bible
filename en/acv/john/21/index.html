And he revealed himself this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other men of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Simon Peter says to them, I am going to harvest fish. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and straightaway entered into the boat. And in that night they caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But having now become morning, Jesus stood on the shore. However the disciples had not seen that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore Jesus says to them, Children, have ye anything eatable? They answered him, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye will find. Therefore they cast, and they were no longer able to draw it for the magnitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it is the Lord, he tied the coat around himself (for he was undressed), and threw himself into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the other disciples came in the skiff (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net of the fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So when they came to the land, they saw a fire of coals set, and fish laying on it, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus says to them, Bring from the fishes that ye now caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three. And being so many, the net was not broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus says to them, Come, eat breakfast. And none of the disciples dared to query him, Who are thou? knowing that it is the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus therefore comes, and takes the bread, and gives to them, and the fish likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples after being raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So when they ate breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me more than these things? He says to him, Yea, Lord. Thou know that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He says to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me? He says to him, Yea, Lord. Thou know that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He says to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do thou love me? And he said to him, Lord, thou know all things. Thou know that I love thee. Jesus says t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly, truly, I say to thee, When thou were younger, thou girded thyself, and walked where thou would, but when thou become old, thou will stretch forth thy hands, and another will gird thee, and carry thee where thou do not want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he will glorify God. And after saying this, he says to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter, having turned around, sees the disciple whom Jesus loves, following, who also leaned near his chest at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the man betraying thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Having seen this man, Peter says to Jesus, Lord, and what of this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus says to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This saying therefore went forth among the brothers, that that disciple does not die. And yet Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is it to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and who wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there are also many other things, as many as Jesus did, which if they would be written every one, I suppose not even the world itself to make room for the books being written. Truly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
