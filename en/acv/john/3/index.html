Can he enter a second time into his mother's belly, and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to thee, If any man is not begotten from water and Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is begotten from the flesh is flesh, and that which is begotten from the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Marvel not that I said to thee, ye must be begotten from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind blows where it will, and thou hear the sound of it, but know not from where it comes, and where it goes. So is every man who is begotten from the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things happen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Thou are the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, truly, I say to thee, we speak that which we know, and testify of what we have seen, and ye do not accept our testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I told you earthly things, and ye do not believe, how will ye believe if I should tell you heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no man has ascended into heaven, except he who came down out of heaven: the Son of man who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that every man who believes in him would not perish, but may have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, so that every man who believes in him would not perish, but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God sent the Son into the world not that he might condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For every man who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, so that his works may not be exposed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he who does the truth comes to the light, so that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the Jewish land. And he remained there with them and immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And John also was immersing in Aenon near Salim because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John was not yet cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore a debate developed from John's disciples with the Jews about purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, about whom thou have testified, behold, this man immerses, and all men come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye yourselves testify that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent ahead of that man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. This therefore my joy is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It is necessary for that man to increase, but me to decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He who comes from above is above all things. He who is of the earth is of the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what he has seen and heard, of this he testifies, and no man receives his testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He who has received his testimony has set a seal that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For he whom God sent speaks the sayings of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
