Jesus answered him, If I may not wash thee, thou have no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus says to him, He who is bathed has no need to wash the feet either, but is entirely clean. And ye are clean, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew the man betraying him. Because of this he said, Ye are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When therefore he washed their feet, and took his garments, having sat down again, he said to them, Do ye understand what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord. And ye say well, for I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, the Lord and the teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash each other's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, so that just as I have done to you ye also should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, a bondman is not greater than his lord, nor is an apostle greater than he who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If ye have seen these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I speak not about you all. I have seen whom I chose, but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with me lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From henceforth I tell you before it happens, so that when it happens, ye may believe that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives any man whomever I may send, receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Having said these things, Jesus was troubled in the spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore the disciples looked at each other, being uncertain about whom he speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And one of his disciples whom Jesus loved was sitting at Jesus' bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore gestured to this man to inquire whoever he may be about whom he speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And that man, having leaned thus toward Jesus' breast, says to him, Lord, who is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus replies, He is that man to whom I, having dipped the morsel, will give. And when he dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the morsel, then Satan entered into that man. Jesus therefore says to him, What thou do, do more quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But no man who was sitting knew why he said this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some thought, since Judas had the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore having received the morsel, straightaway that man went out, and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When he went out, Jesus says, Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God is glorify in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him straightaway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, ye cannot come, I also now say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give to you, that ye should love each other, just as I loved you, so that ye also should love each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this all men will know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love among each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where do thou go? Jesus answered him, Where I go, thou cannot follow me now, but thou will follow me afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, Will thou lay down thy life for me? Truly, truly, I say to thee, A cock will, no, not sound, until thou will deny me thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
