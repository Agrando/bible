My hour is not yet here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother says to the helpers, Whatever he may say to you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were six stone water pots laying there in accordance with the purification of the Jews, containing two or three measures each.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus says to them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them until over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry to the feast-ruler. And they carried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the feast-ruler tasted the water that became wine, and had not known from where it was (but the helpers who drew the water had known), the feast-ruler called the bridegroom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and says to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they drank much, then the lesser. Thou have kept the good wine until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples. And they remained there not many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he found sitting in the temple those who sell oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having made a whip from cords, he drove all out from the temple, both the sheep and the oxen. And he poured out the coins of the moneychangers, and turned over their tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said to those who sell the doves, Take these things from here. Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And his disciples remembered that it is written, Zeal for thy house will consume me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews therefore answered, and said to him, What sign do thou show us since thou do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jews therefore said, This temple was forty-six years being built, and will thou raise it up in three days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But that man spoke about the temple of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he spoke this, and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast, many believed in his name seeing his signs that he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and because he had no need that any man should testify about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
