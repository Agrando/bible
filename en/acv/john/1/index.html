And we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>John testified about him, and cried out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me came to be before me, because he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from his fullness we all received, even grace for grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came to be through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No man has ever seen God. The only begotten Son, being in the bosom of the Father, that man reported him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, Who are thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he confessed, and did not deny, and confessed, I am not the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, What therefore, are thou Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said therefore to him, Who are thou, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do thou say about thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I am the voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of Lord, just as the prophet Isaiah said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And those who were sent were from the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him, and said to him, Why therefore do thou immerse if thou are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I immerse in water, but amidst you stands him whom ye know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is the man who comes after me, who has become before me, of whom I am not worthy that I might loosen the strap of his shoe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things occurred in Bethany beyond the Jordan where John was immersing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>On the morrow John sees Jesus coming to him, and he says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he about whom I said, After me comes a man who has become before me, because he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I had not known him, but that he would be made known to Israel. Because of this I came immersing in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I had not known him. But he who sent me to immerse in water, he said to me, Upon whomever thou will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, this is he who immerses in Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again on the morrow John stood, and two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having looked upon Jesus walking, he says, Behold, the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jesus having turned, and having seen them following, says to them, What seek ye? And they said to him, Rabbi (which says, being interpreted, Teacher), where do thou dwell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and remained with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard from John and who followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>This man first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And having seen him, Jesus said, Thou are Simon the son of Jonah. Thou will be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On the morrow he wanted to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip. And Jesus says to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets wrote: Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, What good can be from Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says about him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael says to him, How do thou know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, being under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered, and says to him, Rabbi, thou are the Son of God. Thou are the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believe? Thou will see greater than these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, henceforth ye will see the heaven opened, and the agents of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
