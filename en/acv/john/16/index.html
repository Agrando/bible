But the hour comes that every man who kills you will presume to be offering service to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they will do these things, because they have not known the Father nor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I have told you these things, so that when the hour comes, ye may remember that I told you of them. But I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, Where do thou go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I depart, for if I do not depart, the helper will not come to you. But whenever I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having come, he will convict the world about sin, and about justice, and about judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>About sin because they truly did not believe in me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and about justice because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and about judgment because the ruler of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but as many things as he may hear, he will speak. And he will report to you the things that are coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me because he will receive from me, and will report to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things, as many as the Father has are mine. Because of this I said that he takes from me, and will report to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and ye do not look at me. Again a little while, and ye will see me, because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore some of his disciples said among themselves, What is this that he says to us, A little while, and ye do not look at me, and, Again a little while, and ye will see me, and, Because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore What is this that he says, A little while? We know not what he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, Do ye inquire among yourselves about this, because I said, A little while, and ye do not look at me, and, Again a little while, and ye will see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, that ye will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. Ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will become into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When a woman brings forth she has pain because her hour has come. But when she has given birth to the child she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a man was born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now therefore indeed ye have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no man takes your joy away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day ye will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, that as many things as ye may ask the Father in my name, he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now ye have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and ye will receive, so that your joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things I have spoken to you in veiled words. The hour comes, when I will no more speak to you in veiled words, but will inform you plainly about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day ye will ask in my name, and I do not say to you, that I will pray the Father about you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loves you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples say to him, Lo, now thou speak plainly, and speak not one veiled word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that thou know all things, and have no need that any man should question thee. By this we believe that thou came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the hour comes, and now has come, that ye will be scattered, each man to his own things, and ye will leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken to you, so that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye have tribulation. But cheer up, I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
