And ye shall give suburbs for the cities round about them to the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they shall have the cities to dwell in, and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye shall measure outside the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the m</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, there shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee to.

Everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then ye shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities ye shall give in the land of Canaan. They shall be cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the sons of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, these six cities shall be for refuge, that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death. When he meets him, he shall put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if he thrust him from hatred, or hurled at him, laying in wait, so that he died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died, he who smote him shall surely be put to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without laying in wait,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, nor sought his harm,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge where he fled.
