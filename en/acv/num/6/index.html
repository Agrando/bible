He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head. Until the days be fulfilled, in which he separates himself to LORD, he shall be holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He shall not come near to a dead body all the days that he separates himself to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the days of his separation he is holy to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation, then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he shall separate to LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering. But the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this is the law of the Nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled: He shall be brought to the door of the tent of meeting,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he shall offer his oblation to LORD: one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest shall present them before LORD, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall also offer the meal-offering of it, and the drink-offering of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after he has shaven his separation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before LORD. This is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh. And after that the Nazarite may drink wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the law of the Nazarite who vows, [and of] his oblation to LORD for his separation, besides that which he is able to get. According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This way ye shall bless the sons of Israel: Ye shall say to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>LORD bless thee, and keep thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>LORD make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So shall they put my name upon the sons of Israel, and I will bless them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
