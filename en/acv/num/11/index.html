And when LORD heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of LORD burnt among them, and devoured in the outermost part of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the people cried to Moses. And Moses prayed to LORD, and the fire abated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of LORD burnt among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly. And the sons of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all except this manna to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance of it as the appearance of bdellium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent. And the anger of LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was displeased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses said to LORD, Why have thou dealt ill with thy servant? And why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou lay the burden of all this people upon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them forth, that thou should say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carries the sucking child, to the land which thou swore to their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight, and let me not see my wretchedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them. And bring them to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and talk with thee there. And I will take from the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou not bear it thyself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh, for ye have wept in the ears of LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore LORD will give you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you, because ye have rejected LORD who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why did we come forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen, and thou have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And LORD said to Moses, Is LORD's hand grown short? Now thou shall see whether my word shall come to pass to thee or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of LORD. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And LORD came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took from the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders. And it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no mor</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. And they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the tent. And they prophesied</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a young man ran, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to him, Are thou jealous for my sake? Would that all of LORD's people were prophets, that LORD would put his Spirit upon them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And there went forth a wind from LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of LORD was kindled against the people, and LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they abode at Hazeroth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
