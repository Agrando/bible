Why then do ye lift up yourselves</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the morning LORD will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him, even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This do: Take you censers, Korah, and all his company,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and put fire in them, and put incense upon them before LORD tomorrow. And it shall be that the man whom LORD chooses, he [is] holy. Ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[Is it] a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and that he has brought thee near, and all thy brothers the sons of Levi with thee? And ye seek the priesthood also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against LORD. And Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. And they said, We will not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is it a small thing that thou have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must make thyself also a ruler over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover thou have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will thou put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses was very angry, and said to LORD, Do not respect thou their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy company before LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the tent of meeting. And the glory of LORD appeared to all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will thou be angry with all the congregation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that LORD has sent me to do all these works, for [it is] not of my own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then LORD has not sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if LORD makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that pertains to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then ye shall understand that these men have despised LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split asunder that was under them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that pertained to Korah, and all their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they, and all that pertained to them, went down alive into Sheol. And the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them, for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And fire came forth from LORD, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men who offered the incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder, for they are holy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>even the censers of these sinners against their own lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before LORD, therefore they are holy, and they shall be a sign to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which those who were burnt had offered, and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>to be a memorial to the sons of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before LORD, that he not be as Korah, and as his company, as LORD spoke to him by Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But on the morrow all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting, and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of LORD appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take thy censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from LORD. The plague has be</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly. And, behold, the plague had begun among the people. And he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stopped.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
