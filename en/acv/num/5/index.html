Ye shall put them outside the camp, that they not defile their camp, in the midst of which I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sons of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp. As LORD spoke to Moses, so did the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Speak to the sons of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against LORD, and that soul shall be guilty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then he shall confess his sin which he has done. And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to LORD shall be the priest's, besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every man's hallowed things shall be his.
