From every tribe of their fathers ye shall send a man, each one a ruler among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of LORD. All of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And see the land, what it is, and the people who dwell in it, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad, and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they went up by the South, and came to Hebron. And Ahaiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a staff between two, also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh, and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and shown them the fruit of the la</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they told him, and said, We came to the land where thou sent us. And surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, very great, and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Amalek dwells in the land of the South. And the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country. And the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the men who went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the sons of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up the inhabitants of it. And all the people that we saw</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And we saw there the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim. And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
