He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, and shall break their bones in pieces, and smite [them] through with his arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness. Who shall rouse him up? He who blesses thee is blessed, And he who curses thee is cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou have altogether blessed them these three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore now flee thou to thy place. I thought to promote thee to great honor, but, lo, LORD has kept thee back from honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to thy messengers that thou sent to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind. What LORD speaks, that I will speak?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will advise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, and the man whose eye was closed says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>he says who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I see him, but not now. I behold him, but not near. There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, [who were] his enemies, while Israel does valiantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of Jacob shall come he who shall have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall come to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thy nest is set in the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God does this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall come to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place, and Balak also went his way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
