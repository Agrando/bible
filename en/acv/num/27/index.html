And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and H</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the rulers and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against LORD in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son?

Thou shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers, and thou shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a man dies, and has no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he has no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if he has no brothers, then ye shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if his father has no brothers, then ye shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it.
