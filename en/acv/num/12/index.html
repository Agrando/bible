Has he not spoken also with us? And LORD heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three to the tent of meeting. And the three came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both came forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, Hear now my words. If there be a prophet among you, I LORD will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches, and he shall behold the form of LORD. Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the anger of LORD was kindled against them, and he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the cloud removed from over the tent. And, behold, Miriam was leprous, as snow. And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses cried to LORD, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days. And the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
