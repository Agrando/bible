And when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the rulers of the congregation, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>the land which LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they said, If we have found favor in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession. Bring us not over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall ye sit here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And why do ye discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which LORD has given them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the sons of Israel, that they should not go into the land which LORD had given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And LORD's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have wholly followed LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of LORD was consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of LORD toward Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness, and ye will destroy all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We will not return to our houses until the sons of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward, because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before LORD to the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the land is subdued before LORD, then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards LORD, and towards Israel, and this land shall be to you for a possession before LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Build for you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep, and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but thy servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before LORD to battle, as my lord says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gil</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, As LORD has said to thy servants, so we will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We will pass over armed before LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance [is] with us beyond the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses gave to them, even to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah. And they gave other names to the cities which they built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns of it, and called them Havvoth-jair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages of it, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
