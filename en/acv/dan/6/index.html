Have thou not signed an interdict, that every man who shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to thee, O king, shall be cast i</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the sons of the captivity of Judah, does not regard thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him. And he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. [Now] the king spoke and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou serve continually, he will deliver thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den. And the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting, nor were instruments of music brought before him. And his sleep fled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou serve continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My God has sent his [heavenly] agent, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me, inasmuch as before him innocence was found in me. And also before thee, O king, I have done no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of harm was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their sons, and their wives.
