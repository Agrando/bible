It turns around continually in its course, and the wind returns again to its circuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place from where the rivers come, there they go again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All things are full of weariness, man cannot utter [it]. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That which has been is that which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be done. And there is no new thing under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Is there a thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is no remembrance of the former [things], nor shall there be any remembrance of the latter that are to come, among those who shall come after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven. It is a great tribulation that God has given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I communed with my own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten for me great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yea, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in much wisdom is much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
