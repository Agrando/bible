For that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Sorrow is better than laughter, for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It is better to hear the rebuke of a wise man, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Surely oppression makes the wise man foolish, and a bribe destroys the understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it. The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say thou not, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? For thou do not inquire wisely concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea, it is more excellent for those who see the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense. But the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Consider the work of God. For who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider. Yea, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All this I have seen in my days of vanity. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs [his life] in his evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not over-righteous, nor show thyself too wise. Why should thou destroy thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not much wrong, nor be thou a fool. Why should thou die before thy time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good that thou should take hold of this, yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand. For he who fears God shall come forth from them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth that does good, and sins not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also do not take heed to all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For many times also thine own heart knows that thou thyself likewise have cursed others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All this I have proved in wisdom. I said, I will be wise, but it was far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I turned about, and my heart [was set] to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason [of things], and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, [and] whose hands are chains. He who pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I have found this, says the Preacher, [laying] one thing to another, to find out the account,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>which my soul still seeks, but I have not found: among a thousand I have found one man, but among all those I have not found a woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, this only I have found: That God made man upright, but they have sought out many contrivances.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
