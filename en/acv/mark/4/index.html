And a great multitude was gathered to him, so as for him, after entering into the boat, to sit on the sea, and all the multitude was by the sea on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Listen. Behold, the man who sows went forth to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass during the sowing, some fell by the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And others fell on the rocky ground where it had not much soil. And straightaway it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the sun was risen it was scorched, and because it had no root it dried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it gave no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And others fell into the good ground and gave fruit, coming up and increasing, and brought forth, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he became alone, those around him, with the twelve, asked him the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, To you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those outside, all things occur in parables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that seeing they may see, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand, lest they should turn, and the sins would be forgiven them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? And how will ye understand all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The man who sows sows the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are those by the path where the word is sown. And whenever they may hear, straightaway Satan comes, and takes away the word that has been sown in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these in like manner are those being sown upon the rocky places, who, whenever they may hear the word, straightaway receive it with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution develops because of the word, straightaway they are caused to stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these are those being sown in the thorns, who hear the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of wealth, and the cravings about other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And these are those that were sown upon the good ground, who hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, Does the lamp come so that it might be put under the bushel or under the bed? Is it not so that it might be put on the lampstand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is not anything hid, except that it may be revealed, nor become secret, but that it may come to be visible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, Watch what ye hear. By what measure ye measure, it will be measured to you, and to those who hear, it will be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever has, to him it will be given. And he who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and lengthen, he knows not how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth bears fruit spontaneously, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit yields, straightaway he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or by what parable shall we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of the mustard plant, which, when it is sown in the ground, is smaller than all the seeds upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet when it is sown, it goes up and becomes greater than all the plants, and it makes great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under the shade of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he did not speak to them apart from a parable, but privately he explained all things to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on that day, having become evening, he says to them, Let us pass through to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having sent the multitude away, they bring him along as he was in the boat. And other small boats were also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And a great storm of wind develops, and the waves were thrown into the boat, so as for it now to be filling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he himself was in the stern sleeping on the cushion. And they awake him, and say to him, Teacher, does it not concern thee that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having awaken, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Be quiet! Silence! And the wind ceased, and it became a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to them, Why are ye cowardly this way? How have ye no faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared a great fear, and said to each other, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea also obey him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
