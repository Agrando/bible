And they said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And after taking the seven loaves, having given thanks, he broke in pieces, and gave to his disciples so that they might place before them. And they place before the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they had a few small fishes. And having blessed them, he said to also place before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they ate and were filled. And they took up seven hampers of surplus fragments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who ate were about four thousand, and he sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And straightaway having entered into the boat with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to dispute with him, seeking from him a sign from the sky, testing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And having sighed deeply in his spirit, he says, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I am telling you, if a sign will be given to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And having left them, having entered again into a boat, he departed to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they forgot to take loaves, and they did not have with them in the boat except one loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he commanded them, saying, Take heed, watch for the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they deliberated among each other, saying, We have no loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And knowing it Jesus says to them, Why do ye deliberate because ye have no loaves? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand? Have ye your heart still hardened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Having eyes, ye see not, and having ears, ye hear not? And do ye not remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? They say to him, Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the seven for the four thousand, how many hampers full of fragments did ye take up? And they said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, How do ye not understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he comes to Bethsaida, and they bring a blind man to him, and call for him so that he might touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having taken the hand of the blind man, he led him outside of the village. And having spat on his eyes, having laid his hands upon him, he questioned him if he sees anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having looked up, he said, The men that I see, I see as trees walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then again he put his hands upon his eyes, and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw all men clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Thou may neither go into the village, nor may tell any man in the village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he questioned his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered, saying, John the immerser, and others, Elijah, but others, one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he says to them, But who do ye say that I am? And having answered, Peter says to him, Thou are the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he chided them that they should tell no man about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scholars, and be killed, and after three days to rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he spoke the matter openly. And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he, having turned around, and having looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Go thee behind me, Satan, because thou think not the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having called in the multitude with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wants to follow behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life because of me and the good-news, this man will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what will it profit a man if he should gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For whoever may be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy agents.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
