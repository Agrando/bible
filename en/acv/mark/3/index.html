But they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And having looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the callousness of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharisees having gone out, they straightaway were making a plot with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard how many things he did, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke to his disciples that a small boat would stay by him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he healed many, so as to press upon him, so that as many as had afflictions might touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying, Thou are the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he chided them much that they should not make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he goes up onto the mountain, and calls in those whom he himself wanted, and they went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he appointed twelve men, so that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he added to Simon the name Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he added to them the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
