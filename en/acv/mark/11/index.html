After untying it, bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if any man should say to you, Why are ye doing this? say ye, The Lord has need of it, and straightaway he sends it here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they departed, and found the colt tied by the door outside in the street, and they untied it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And some of those who stood there said to them, What are ye doing, untying the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they said to them just as Jesus commanded, and they allowed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and he sat upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And many spread their garments upon the road, and others were cutting branches from the fields, and were spreading on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who went in front, and those who came behind, cried out saying, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of Lord! Hosanna in the highest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple. And when he looked around on all things, the hour now being evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the morrow when they came out from Bethany he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And having seen a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if perhaps he will find anything on it. And when he came to it he found nothing except leaves, for it was not the time of figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And having responded, Jesus said to it, No man may eat fruit from thee, no more into the age. And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come to Jerusalem. And having entered into the temple, Jesus began to drive out those who sold and bought in the temple. And he overturned the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he did not permit that any man might carry a container through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But ye made it a den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the scholars and the chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him, for they feared him, because all the people were awed at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when it became evening he went forth outside of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree dried out from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having remembered, Peter says to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree that thou cursed has been dried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having answered, Jesus says to them, Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For truly I say to you, that whoever may say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, and will not doubt in his heart, but will believe that what he says comes to pass, whatever he may say will be for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because of this I say to you, all things, as many as ye may ask, praying, believe that ye receive, and it will be for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whenever ye may stand praying, forgive, if ye have anything against any man, so that also your Father in the heavens will forgive you your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father in the heavens forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scholars, and the elders come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they say to him, By what authority are thou doing these things? Or who gave thee this authority so that thou may do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And having answering, Jesus said to them, I also will question you one word, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The immersion of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But should we say, From men? (They feared the people, for all held John that he was indeed a prophet.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And having answered, they say to Jesus, We do not know. And having answering, Jesus says to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
