And the chief priests and the scholars sought how, having take him with trickery, they might kill him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>but they said, Not during the feast, lest there will be an uproar of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat relaxing, a woman came having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure spikenard, very valuable. And having broken the alabaster cruse, she poured it on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And some were indignant within themselves, saying, Why has this waste of the ointment happened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this could have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and given to the poor. And they grumbled at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said, Leave her be. Why do ye cause troubles for her? She performed a good work on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For ye always have the poor with you, and whenever ye may desire ye can do them well, but ye do not always have me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She applied what she had to anoint my body. She did it beforehand for the burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And truly I say to you, wherever this good-news may be preached in the whole world, also what she did will be told for a memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, so that he might betray him to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might betray him conveniently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, his disciples say to him, Where do thou want, after going, we should prepare that thou may eat the Passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he sends forth two of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And wherever he may enter, say ye to the house-ruler, The teacher says, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he himself will show you a large upper room spread out ready. Prepare ye for us there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found just as he had said to them. And they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having become evening he comes with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as they were relaxing and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, that one of you eating with me will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Not I? and another, Not I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having answered, he said to them, It is one of the twelve dipping with me in the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Son of man indeed goes as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It was good for him if that man was not born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as they were eating, Jesus having taken bread, having blessed, he broke in pieces, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat, this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after taking the cup, having expressed thanks, he gave to them, and they all drank from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly I say to you, that I will no more drink of the fruit of the grapevine, until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when they sang a hymn, they went out onto the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus says to them, All ye will be caused to stumble by me this night, because it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter said to him, Even if all will be caused to stumble, yet not I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee, that thou today, in this night, before a cock sounds twice, will deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he spoke more extreme, If I must die with thee, I will, no, not deny thee. And they all spoke the same way also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they come to a place the name of which was Gethsemane. And he says to his disciples, Sit ye here until I pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he takes Peter and James and John with him, and began to be greatly disturbed, and very distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he says to them, My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain ye here, and watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having gone forward a little, he fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee. Remove this cup from me, but not what I want, but what thou want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he comes and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, Simon, Do thou sleep? Could thou not watch one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Watch ye and pray that ye may not enter into temptation. Truly, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And again having departed, he prayed, having said the same statement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having returned, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down, and they knew not what they should reply to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he comes the third time, and says to them, Sleep the remaining, and take your rest...It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me has come near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And straightaway, while he still spoke, Judas, being one of the twelve, comes, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests, and the scholars, and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss is he. Seize him, and lead away securely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he came, straightaway having approached him, he says, Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they threw their hands on him, and seized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And a certain one of those who stood by, having drawn his sword, struck the bondman of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And having answered, Jesus said to them, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I was daily near you, teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me--but that the scriptures might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And having forsook him, they all fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And a certain one young man followed with him, having been wrapped naked in a linen cloth. And the young men seized him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>but having left behind the linen cloth, he fled from them naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they led Jesus away to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scholars assemble with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Peter followed him from a distance, as far as inside the courtyard of the high priest, and was sitting with the subordinates, and warming himself near the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, and did not find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For many testified falsely against him, and their testimonies were not consistent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And some men having stood up, testified falsely against him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>We heard him saying, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and by three days I will build another not made with hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And not even this way was their testimony consistent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And the high priest having stood up in the midst, he demanded Jesus, saying, Thou answer nothing? What is it these men testify against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he remained silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest demanded him, and says to him, Are thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Jesus said, I am. And ye will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the high priest having torn his clothes, he says, What further need have we of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Ye have heard the blasphemy. What does it seem to you? And they all condemned him to be deserving of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him with a fist, and to say to him, Prophesy. And the subordinates were throwing him with slaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And having seen Peter warming himself, having looked at him, she says, Thou also were with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied, saying, I know not, nor understand what thou say. And he went outside onto the porch, and a cock sounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And the servant girl having seen him, she began again to say to those who stood by, This man is from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he again denied it. And after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, Surely thou are from them, for thou are a Galilean, and thy accent is similar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>But he began to curse and to swear, I do not know this man of whom ye speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And the second time a cock sounded. And Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him, Before a cock sounds twice, thou will deny me thrice. And having broke down, he wept.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
