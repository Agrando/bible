And multitudes come together to him again, and, as he has practiced, he taught them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Pharisees having approached, they demanded of him if it is permitted for a man to divorce a wife, testing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And having answered, he said to them, What did Moses command you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said, Moses permitted to write a document of divorce, and to divorce her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But having answered, Jesus said to them, For your hard heart he wrote for you this commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because of this a man will leave his father and mother behind, and will be bonded with his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the two will be in one flesh. So then they are no more two, but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What therefore God has joined together, no man shall separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in the house the disciples questioned him again about the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he says to them, Whoever may divorce his wife, and will marry another, commits adultery against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a woman should divorce her husband, and will be married to another, she commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they brought children to him, so that he would touch them. And the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when Jesus saw it, he was displeased, and said to them, Allow the children to come to me. Forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child, he will, no, not enter it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And having embraced them, while laying his hands upon them, he blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as he was going forth on the way, one man having ran to him, and having knelt to him, questioned him, Good teacher, what should I do that I may inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus said to him, Why do thou call me good? None is good except one, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou know the commandments. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not testify falsely. Thou shall not defraud. Thou shall honor thy father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having answered, he said to him, Teacher, all these things I have observed from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having looked at him, Jesus loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lack. Go thou, sell as many things as thou have, and give to the poor, and thou will have treasure in heaven. And after taking up the cross, come, follow me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But having become somber at the saying, he went away sorrowing, for he was a man who has many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus having looked around, he says to his disciples, How difficultly those who have riches will enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the disciples were astonished at his words. But again having answered, Jesus says to them, Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the hole of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were exceedingly astonished, saying among themselves, Then who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And having looked at them, Jesus says, With men, impossible, but not with God. For with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter began to say to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And having answered, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, there is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, because of me, and because of the good-news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but he will receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands--with persecutions--and in the coming age, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many first will be last, and the last first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And again having summoned the twelve, he began to tell them the things that were going to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem. And the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scholars. And they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they will mock him, and will scourge, and will spit upon him, and will kill him. And the third day he will rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Teacher, we wish that thou would do for us whatever we ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, What do ye want me to do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one at thy right hand, and one at thy left hand, in thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye are asking. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? And to be immersed the immersion that I am immersed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, Ye will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and the immersion that I am immersed ye will be immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But to sit at my right hand or at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard it they began to indignant about James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And having summoned them, Jesus says to them, Ye know that those who presume to rule over the Gentiles, lord over them, and their great men have power over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But it is not so among you. Instead, whoever may want to become great among you, will be your helper,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever of you may want to become first, will be a bondman of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For the Son of man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they come to Jericho. And as he went out from Jericho, and his disciples and a considerable crowd, Bartimaeus, the blind son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, thou son of David, be merciful to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many rebuked him, that he would be quiet, but he cried out much more, Thou son of David, be merciful to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And having stood still, Jesus said for him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Cheer up. Arise, he calls thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he, having thrown off his garment, having risen, came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And having answered, Jesus says to him, What do thou wish I would do for thee? And the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to him, Go thou, thy faith has healed thee. And straightaway he received his sight, and followed him on the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
