And why should I not be impatient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even when I remember, I am troubled, and horror takes hold on my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why do the wicked live, become old, yea, grow mighty in power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their seed is established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their houses are safe from fear, nor is the rod of God upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Their bull breeds, and does not fail. Their cow brings forth safely, and does not miscarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment they go down to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they say to God, Depart from us, for we do not desire the knowledge of thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is the Almighty that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lo, [is] their prosperity not in their hand. (The counsel of the wicked is far from me.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How often is it that the lamp of the profane is put out, that their calamity comes upon them, that [God] distributes sorrows in his anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that they are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carries away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>[Ye say], God lays up his iniquity for his sons. Let him recompense it to himself that he may know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For what does he care for his house after him when the number of his months is cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing he judges those who are high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One man dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His pails are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And another man dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm covers them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices with which ye would wrong me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent in which the wicked dwelt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet he shall be borne to the grave, and men shall keep watch over the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him.
