He too flees as a shadow, and does not continue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And do thou open thine eyes upon such a one, and bring me into judgment with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with thee, and thou have appointed his bounds that he cannot pass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>look away from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch of it will not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though the root of it grows old in the earth, and the trunk of it dies in the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But man dies, and is laid low. Yea, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[As] the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes away and dries up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so man lays down and does not rise. Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O that thou would hide me in Sheol, that thou would keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou would appoint for me a set time, and remember me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man dies, shall he live [again]? All the days of my warfare I would wait till my release should come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou would call, and I would answer thee. Thou would have a desire to the work of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now thou number my steps. Do thou not watch over my sin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou fasten up my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the falling mountain comes to nothing, and the rock is removed out of its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The waters wear the stones. The overflowings of it wash away the dust of the earth. So thou destroy the hope of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou prevail forever against him, and he passes. Thou change his countenance, and send him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His sons come to honor, and he does not know it, and they are brought low, but he does not perceive it of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his flesh upon him has pain, and his soul within him mourns.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
