Men in whom ripe age is perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They are gaunt with want and famine. They gnaw the dry ground in the gloom of waste and desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They pluck mallows by the bushes, and the roots of the juniper are their food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are driven forth from the midst [of men]. They cry out after them as after a thief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>so that they dwell in frightful valleys, in holes of the earth and of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Among the bushes they bray, under the nettles they are gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>[They are] sons of fools, yea, sons of base men. They were scourged out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now I have become their song, Yea, I am a byword to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They abhor me. They stand aloof from me, and do not spare to spit in my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he has loosed his cord, and afflicted me. And they have cast off the bridle before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Upon my right hand rise the rabble. They thrust aside my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They mar my path. They set forward my calamity, [even] men who have no helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As through a wide breach they come. In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves [upon me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Terrors are turned upon me. They chase my honor as the wind, and my welfare is passed away as a cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now my soul is poured out within me. Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the [pains] that gnaw me take no rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By the great force my garment is disfigured. It binds me about as the collar of my coat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I cry to thee, and thou do not answer me. I stand up, and thou gaze at me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou have turned to be cruel to me. With the might of thy hand thou persecute me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou lift me up to the wind. Thou cause me to ride [upon it], and thou disintegrate me in the storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I know that thou will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>However does not a man stretch out the hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Did I not weep for him who was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I looked for good, then evil came. And when I waited for light, there came darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My heart is troubled, and does not rest. Days of affliction have come upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I go mourning without the sun. I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>My skin is black, [and falls] from me. And my bones are burned with heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore my harp has [turned] to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
