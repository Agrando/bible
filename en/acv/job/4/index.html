But who can withhold himself from speaking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, thou have instructed many, and thou have strengthened the weak hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thy words have upheld him who was falling, and thou have made firm the feeble knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now it comes to thee, and thou faint. It touches thee, and thou are troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not thy fear [of God] thy confidence, the integrity of thy ways thy hope?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According as I have seen, those who plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a whisper of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance of it. A form was before my eyes. [There was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his maker?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, he puts no trust in his servants, and he charges his [heavenly] agents with folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?
