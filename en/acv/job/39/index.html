[Or] can thou mark when the hinds do calve?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Can thou number the months that they fulfill? Or do thou know the time when they bring forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They bow themselves. They bring forth their young. They cast out their pains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their young ones become strong. They grow up in the open field. They go forth, and return not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who has sent out the wild donkey free? Or who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling-place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear the shoutings of the driver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Can thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will thou trust him because his strength is great? Or will thou leave to him thy labor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Will thou confide in him that he will bring home thy seed, and gather [the grain] of thy threshing-floor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, [but] are they the pinions and plumage of love?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For she leaves her eggs on the ground, and warms them in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may trample them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She deals hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers. Though her labor be in vain, [she is] without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because God has deprived her of wisdom, nor has he imparted understanding to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The time she lifts up herself on high she scorns the horse and his rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have thou given the horse [his] might? Have thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Have thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is awesome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength. He goes out to meet the armed men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed. Neither does he turn back from the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage, nor does he believe that it is the voice of the trumpet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As often as the trumpet [sounds] he says, Aha! And he smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soars, (and) stretches her wings toward the south?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Is it at thy command that the eagle mounts up, and makes her nest on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>She dwells on the cliff, and makes her home upon the point of the cliff and the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From there she spies out the prey. Her eyes behold it afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Her young ones also suck up blood. And where the slain are, there is she.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
