For Job said, It may be that my so</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before LORD, that Satan also came among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And LORD said to Satan, From where do thou come? Then Satan answered LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And LORD said to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Satan answered LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has, on every side? Thou have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in thy power, only upon himself do not put forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away. Yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God fell from heaven, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and only I alone have escaped</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there. LORD gave, and LORD has taken away, blessed be the name of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job did not sin, nor foolishly accuse God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
