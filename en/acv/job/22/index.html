Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou are righteous? Or is it gain [to him] that thou make thy ways perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Is it for thy fear [of him] that he reproves thee, that he enters with thee into judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thou have taken pledges from thy brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou have not given water to the weary to drink, and thou have withheld bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for the mighty man, he had the land. And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubles thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>or darkness, so that thou cannot see, and abundance of waters cover thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thou say, What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Will thou keep the old way which wicked men have trodden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>who said to God, Depart from us, and, What can the Almighty do for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet he filled their houses with good things. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The righteous see it, and are glad. And the innocent laugh them to scorn,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[Saying], Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, and the remnant of them, the fire has consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace. By this good shall come to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou return to the Almighty, thou shall be built up, thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then thou shall lay up gold as dust, and [the gold of] Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yea, the Almighty will be thy treasure, and precious silver to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For then shall thou delight thyself in the Almighty, and shall lift up thy face to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thou shall make thy prayer to him, and he will hear thee, and thou shall pay thy vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to thee. And light shall shine upon thy ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they cast [thee] down, thou shall say, [There is] lifting up, and he will save the humble man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He will deliver [even] him who is not innocent. Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
