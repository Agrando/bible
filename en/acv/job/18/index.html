Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp above him shall be put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The steps of his strength shall be restricted, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks upon the toils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A trap shall take [him] by the heel.
