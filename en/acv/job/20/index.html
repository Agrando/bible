Those who have seen him shall say, Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found. Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more behold him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His sons shall seek the favor of the poor, and his hands shall give back his wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His bones are full of his youth, but it shall lie down with him in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>though he spares it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is the gall of asps within him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall suck the poison of asps. The viper's tongue shall kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save any of that in which he delights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There was nothing left that he did not devour, therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits. The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he is about to fill his belly, [God] will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, and will rain it upon him while he is eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of brass shall strike him through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body, yea, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors are upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All darkness is laid up for his treasures. A fire not blown shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The increase of his house shall depart, flowed away in the day of his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
