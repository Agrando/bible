They hang afar from men; they swing to and fro.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As for the earth, out of it comes bread, and underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The stones of it are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>No bird of prey knows that path, nor has the falcon's eye seen it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He puts forth his hand upon the flinty rock. He overturns the mountains by the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He cuts out channels among the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He binds the streams that they not trickle. And the thing that is hid he brings forth to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Man does not know the price of it, nor is it found in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The deep says, It is not in me. And the sea says, It is not with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It cannot be gotten for gold, nor shall silver be weighed for the price of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal. Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, nor shall it be valued with pure gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where then does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Since it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept closed from the birds of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>God understands the way of it, and he knows the place of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to make a weight for the wind. Yea, he distributes the waters by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then he saw it, and declared it. He established it, yea, and searched it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And to man he said, Behold, the fear of LORD, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
