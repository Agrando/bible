He who argues with God, let him answer it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Job answered LORD, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have spoken once, and I will not answer, yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Gird up thy loins now like a man. I will demand of thee, and declare thou to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will thou even annul my judgment? Will thou condemn me, that thou may be justified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or have thou an arm like God? And can thou thunder with a voice like him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity, and array thyself with honor and majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger, and look upon everyone who is proud, and abase him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Look on everyone who is proud, [and] bring him low, and tread down the wicked where they stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden [place].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I will also confess of thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold now behemoth, which I made as well as thee. He eats grass as an ox.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His bones are [as] tubes of brass. His limbs are like bars of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He is a beginning of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He lays under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the fen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The lotus trees cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook encompass him about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, if a river overflows, he does not tremble. He is confident though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
