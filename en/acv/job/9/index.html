But how can man be just with God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If he is pleased to contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>[He is] wise in heart, and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[He] who removes the mountains, and they do not know it when he overturns them in his anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars of it tremble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>who commands the sun, and it does not rise, and seals up the stars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>who alone stretches out the heavens, and treads upon the waves of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who does great things past finding out, yea, marvelous things without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Lo, he goes by me, and I do not see him. He also passes on, but I do not perceive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, he seizes; who can hinder him? Who will say to him, What are thou doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words [to reason] with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whom, though I were righteous, yet I would not answer. I would make supplication to my judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I would not believe that he hearkened to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He will not allow me to take my breath, but fills me with bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If of strength, lo, [he is] mighty! And if of justice, who will summon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Though I be righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me. Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Though I were perfect, I do not regard myself. I despise my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is all one thing. Therefore I say, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If the scourge kills suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of the judges of it. If not [he], who then is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away. They see no good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They are passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If I say, I will forget my complaint. I will put off my [sad] countenance, and be of good cheer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I am afraid of all my sorrows. I know that thou will not hold me innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I shall be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands ever so clean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>yet thou will plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>There is no umpire between us who might lay his hand upon us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his terror make me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then I would speak, and not be afraid of him, for I am not so in myself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
