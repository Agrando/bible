His anger was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His anger was also kindled against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his anger was kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old. Therefore I held back, and dared not show you my opinion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It is not the great who are wise, nor the aged who understand justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I said, Hearken to me, I also will show my opinion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, while ye searched out what to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, I attended to you. And, behold, there was none who convinced Job, or who answered his words among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom. God may vanquish him, not man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For he has not directed his words against me. Neither will I answer him with your speeches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are amazed, they answer no more. They have not a word to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And shall I wait because they do not speak, because they stand still, and answer no more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I also will answer my part. I also will show my opinion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for I am full of words. The spirit within me compels me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent. Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will speak that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Let me not, I pray you, respect any man's person. Neither will I give flattering titles to any man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I know not to give flattering titles, [else] my maker would soon take me away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
