Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And be it indeed that I have erred, my error remains with myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>know now that God has subverted me, and has encompassed me with his net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry for help, but there is no justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He has walled up my way that I cannot pass, and has set darkness in my paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone. And he has plucked up my hope like a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He has also kindled his wrath against me. And he considers me to him as his adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His troops come on together, and cast up their way against me, and encamp round about my tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He has put my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, reckon me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer. I entreat him with my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My breath is strange to my wife, and my supplication to the sons of my own mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even young children despise me. If I arise, they speak against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All my familiar friends abhor me, and those whom I loved are turned against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My bone cleaves to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends, for the hand of God has touched me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O that my words were now written! O that they were inscribed in a book,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>that they were engraved in the rock forever with an iron pen and lead!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as for me I know that my Redeemer lives, and at last he will stand up upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after my skin, this [body], is destroyed, then outside my flesh I shall see God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>whom I, even I, shall see on my side, and my eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>be ye afraid of the sword. For wrath [brings] the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
