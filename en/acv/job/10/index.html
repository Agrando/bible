I will give free reign to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will say to God, Do not condemn me. Show me why thou contend with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it good to thee that thou should oppress, that thou should despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have thou eyes of flesh? Or do thou see as man sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Are thy days as the days of man, or thy years as man's days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that thou inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>although thou know that I am not wicked. And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thy hands have made me and fashioned me together round about, yet thou destroy me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember, I beseech thee, that thou have fashioned me as clay. And will thou bring me into dust again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thou have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou have granted me life and loving kindness, and thy visitation has preserved my spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet these things thou hid in thy heart. I know that this is with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I sin, then thou mark me. And thou will not acquit me from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I be wicked, woe to me. And if I be righteous, yet I shall not lift up my head, being filled with shame, and looking upon my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if [my head] exalts itself, thou hunt me as a lion. And again thou show thyself marvelous upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou renew thy witnesses against me, and increase thine indignation upon me. Changes and warfare are with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why then have thou brought me forth out of the womb? I would have given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I should have been as though I had not been. I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Are not my days few? Cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>before I go where I shall not return, to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>the land dark as midnight, of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as midnight.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
