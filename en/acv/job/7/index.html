And are not his days like the days of a hireling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, and as a hireling who looks for his wages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>so I am made to possess months of misery, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossing to and fro to the dawning of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O remember that my life is a breath. My eye shall no more see good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The eye of him who sees me shall behold me no more. Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall return no more to his house, nor shall his place know him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I will not refrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou set a watch over me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When I say, My bed shall comfort me. My couch shall ease my complaint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then thou scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that my soul chooses strangling and death rather than [these] my bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I loathe [my life]. I would not live always. Let me alone, for my days are vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What is man, that thou should magnify him, and that thou should set thy mind upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and that thou should visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How long will thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If I have sinned, what do I do to thee, O thou watcher of men? Why have thou set me as a mark for thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And why do thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lay down in the dust, and thou will seek me diligently, but I shall not be.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
