And the spirit of God is in my nostrils.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, nor shall my tongue utter deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Far be it from me that I should justify you. Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I hold fast my righteousness, and will not let it go. My heart shall not reproach [me] so long as I live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For what is the hope of the profane, though he gets him gain, when God takes away his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call upon God at all times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will teach you concerning the hand of God. That which is with the Almighty I will not conceal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it. Why then have ye become altogether vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If his sons be multiplied, it is for the sword. And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Those who remain of him shall be buried in death, and his widows shall make no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Though he heaps up silver as the dust, and prepares raiment as the clay,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He builds his house as the moth, and as a booth which the keeper makes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He lays down rich, but he shall not be gathered [to his fathers]. He opens his eyes, and he is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Terrors overtake him like waters. A tempest steals him away in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The east wind carries him away, and he departs, and it sweeps him out of his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For [God] shall hurl at him, and not spare. He would gladly flee out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
