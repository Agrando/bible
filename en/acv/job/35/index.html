Who are thou that thou said, I am righteousness before LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That thou said, What advantage will it be to thee? [And], What profit shall I have more than if I had sinned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Look to the heavens, and see. And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If thou have sinned, what do thou effect against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what do thou to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If thou be righteous, what do thou give him?
