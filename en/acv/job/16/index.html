Miserable comforters are ye all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Shall vain words have an end? Or what provokes thee that thou answer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I also could speak as ye do, if your soul were in my soul's stead. I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[But] I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage [your grief].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged, and though I forbear, what am I eased?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But now he has made me weary. Thou have made desolate all my company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou have laid fast hold on me, [which] is a witness [against me]. And my leanness rises up against me; it testifies to my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me. He has gnashed upon me with his teeth. My adversary sharpens his eyes upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have gaped upon me with their mouth. They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves together against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God delivers me to the perverse, and casts me into the hands of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yea, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His archers encompass me round about. He splits my reins apart, and does not spare. He pours out my gall upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He breaks me with breach upon breach. He runs upon me like a giant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>My face is red with weeping, and the shadow of death is on my eyelids,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O earth, do not cover thou my blood, and let my cry have no [resting] place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who vouches for me is on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My friends scoff at me. My eye pours out tears to God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that he would maintain the right of a man with God, and of a son of man with his neighbor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For when a few years are come, I shall go the way where I shall not return.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
