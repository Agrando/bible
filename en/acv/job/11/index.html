And should a man full of talk be justified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mock, shall no man make thee ashamed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thou say, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But O that God would speak, and open his lips against thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacts of thee less than thine iniquity deserves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Can thou find out God by searching? Can thou find out the Almighty to perfection?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It is high as heaven; what can thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what can thou know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The measure of it is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he passes through, and shuts up, and all to judgment, then who can hinder him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knows FALSE men. He also sees iniquity. Will he not then consider it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But vain man is void of understanding. Yea, man is born [as] a wild donkey's colt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If thou set thy heart aright, and stretch out thy hands toward him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if iniquity is in thy hand, put it far away, and let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Surely then thou shall lift up thy face without spot. Yea, thou shall be steadfast, and shall not fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thou shall forget thy misery. Thou shall remember it as waters that are passed away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And [thy] life shall be clearer than the noonday. Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And thou shall be secure, because there is hope. Yea, thou shall search [about thee], and shall take thy rest in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also thou shall lie down, and none shall make thee afraid. Yea, many shall correspond with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee. And their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
