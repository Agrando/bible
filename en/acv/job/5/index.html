And to which of the holy ones will thou turn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For vexation kills the foolish man, and jealousy slays the silly one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>His sons are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>whose harvest the hungry eat up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapes for their substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For affliction does not come forth from the dust, nor does trouble spring out of the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for me, I would seek to God. And to God I would commit my cause,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who gives rain upon the earth, and sends waters upon the fields,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so that he sets up on high those who are low, and those who mourn are exalted to safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He frustrates the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He takes the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So a poor man has hope, and iniquity stops her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise thou the chastening of the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he injures, and binds up. He wounds, and his hands make whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will deliver thee in six troubles. Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In famine he will redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue. Neither shall thou be afraid of destruction when it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>At destruction and dearth thou shall laugh, nor shall thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For thou shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And thou shall know that thy tent is in peace, and thou shall visit thy fold, and shall miss nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou shall know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou shall come to thy grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Lo this, we have searched it, so it is. Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
