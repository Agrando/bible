Let us know among ourselves what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Job has said, I am righteous, and God has taken away my right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Notwithstanding my right I am [accounted] a liar. My wound is incurable, [though I am] without transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>saying, I have not sinned, nor committed unrighteousness, nor had fellowship with workers of iniquity to go with the profane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For thou should not say, There shall be no visitation to a man, [whereas] visitation [is] to him from LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding. Far be it from me to sin before LORD, and pervert righteousness before the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, certainly God will not do wrong. Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who has disposed the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he sets his heart upon himself, [if] he gathers his spirit and his breath to himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>all flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If now [thou be] understanding, hear this. Hearken to the voice of words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold thou him who hates lawlessness, and who destroys evil men, who is forever righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[him] who says to a king, [Thou are] vile, to ranking men, [Ye are] wicked,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who does not respect the persons of rulers, nor regards the rich more than the poor. For they all are the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, and he sees all his goings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness, nor thick gloom where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he needs no further to consider a man, that he should go before God in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He breaks in pieces mighty men [in ways] past finding out, and sets others in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he takes knowledge of their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because they turned aside from following him, and would not have regard in any of his ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hides his face, who then can behold him? [It is] the same whether to a nation, or to a man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that the profane man not reign, that there be none to ensnare the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For has any said to God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Teach thou me that which I do not see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shall his recompense be as thou desire, that thou refuse it? For thou must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what thou know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men of understanding will say to me, yes, every wise man who hears me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job speaks without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But surely not. Learn thou Job not to still give an answer like the foolish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>so that we may not add to our sins, and lawlessness will be reckoned against us, speaking many words before LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
