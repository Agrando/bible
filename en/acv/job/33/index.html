My tongue has spoken in my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My words [shall utter] the uprightness of my heart, and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If thou can, answer thou me. Set [thy words] in order before me. Stand forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, I am toward God even as thou are. I also am formed out of the clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, nor shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Surely thou have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words, [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am clean, without transgression. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[Thou say,] Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, I will answer thee. In this thou are not just, for God is greater than man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why do thou strive against him because he does not give of any of his matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For God speaks once, yea twice, [though man] does not regard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings upon the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, and hide pride from man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He also is chastened with pain upon his bed, and with continual strife in his bones,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen. And his bones that were not seen stick out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If there be with him a [heavenly] agent, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then [God] is gracious to him, and says, Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. He returns to the days of his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy, and he restores to man his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He sings before men, and says, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it did not profit me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall behold the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lo, all these things God works twice, [yea] thrice, with a man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Mark well, O Job, hearken to me. Keep silent, and I will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If thou have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If not, hearken thou to me. Keep silent, and I will teach thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
