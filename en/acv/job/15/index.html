And thou choose the tongue of the crafty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thine own mouth condemns thee, and not I. Yes, thine own lips testify against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Are thou the first man who was born? Or were thou brought forth before the hills?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Have thou heard the secret counsel of God? And do thou limit wisdom to thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What do thou know, that we do not know? What do thou understand, which is not in us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much older than thy father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Are the consolations of God too small for thee, even the word that is gentle toward thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why does thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes flash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>that against God thou turn thy spirit, and let words go out of thy mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is man, that he should be clean? And he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>How much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will show thee. Hear thou me, and that which I have seen I will declare,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The wicked man travails with pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He does not believe that he shall return out of darkness. And he is awaited by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He wanders abroad for bread, [saying], Where is it? He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him as a king ready to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He runs upon him with a [stiff] neck, with the thick studs of his bucklers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat upon his loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he has dwelt in desolate cities, in houses which no man inhabited, which were ready to become heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He shall not depart out of darkness. The flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of [God's] mouth he shall go away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself. For vanity shall be his recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the company of the hypocrites shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their heart prepares deceit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
