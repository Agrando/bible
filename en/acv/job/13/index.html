My ear has heard and understood it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>What ye know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But ye are forgers of lies. Ye are all physicians of no value.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O that ye would altogether be silent! And it would be your wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will ye speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is it good that he should search you out? Or as deceiving a man, will ye deceive him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He will surely reprove you if ye secretly show partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Shall not his majesty make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes. Your defenses are defenses of clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be quiet. Let me alone that I may speak, and let come on me what will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, he will kill me; I have no hope. Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This also shall be my salvation, that a profane man shall not come before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hear diligently my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold now, I have set my case in order. I know that I am righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is he who will contend with me? For then I would keep silent and give up the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Only do not do two things to me, then I will not hide myself from thy face:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Withdraw thy hand far from me, and do not let thy dread make me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then call thou, and I will answer, or let me speak, and answer thou me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Why do thou hide thy face, and reckon me for thine enemy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Will thou harass a driven leaf? And will thou pursue the dry stubble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For thou write bitter things against me, and make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thou also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. Thou set a bound to the soles of my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Though I am like a rotten thing that decays, like a garment that is moth-eaten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
