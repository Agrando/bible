He thunders with the voice of his majesty, and he does not restrain [the lightnings] when his voice is heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>God thunders marvelously with his voice. He does great things which we cannot comprehend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he says to the snow, Fall thou on the earth, likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has made may know [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the beasts go into coverts, and remain in their dens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Out of the chamber [of the south] comes the storm, and cold out of the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By the breath of God ice is given, and the breadth of the waters is narrowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yea, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and it is turned round about by his guidance, that they may do whatever he commands them upon the face of the habitable world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He causes it to come, whether it be for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Hearken to this, O Job. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do thou know how God lays [his charge] upon them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do thou know the balancing of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How thy garments are warm when the earth is still because of the south [wind]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Can thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong as a molten mirror?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Teach us what we shall say to him. We cannot set in array because of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall it be told him that I would speak?

God has upon him awesome majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[O] the Almighty, we cannot find him out. He is excellent in power. And in justice and abundant righteousness he will not afflict.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Men therefore fear him. He does not regard any who are wise of heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
