Or will he speak soft words to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will he make a covenant with thee, that thou should take him for a servant forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will thou play with him as with a bird? Or will thou bind him for thy maidens?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Will the bands make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Can thou fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish-spears?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lay thy hand upon him. Remember the battle, and do so no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Will not [a man] be cast down even at the sight of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Under the whole heaven is mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[His] strong scales are [his] pride, shut up together [like] a close seal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>One is so near to another that no air can come between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are joined one to another. They stick together, so that they cannot be parted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot and [burning] rushes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes forth from his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm upon him. They cannot be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His heart is as firm as a stone, Yea, firm as the nether millstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid. Because of consternation they are beside themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If a man lays at him with the sword it cannot avail, nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He counts iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The arrow cannot make him flee. Sling-stones are turned into stubble with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>His underparts are [like] sharp potsherds. He spreads out [as] a threshing-wagon upon the mire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He makes a path to shine after him. [A man] would think the deep to be hoary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He beholds everything that is high.
