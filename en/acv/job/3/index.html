Let not God from above seek for it, nor let the light shine upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell upon it. Let blackness come upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, nor let it behold the eyelids of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For now I should have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept. Then I would have been at rest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built waste places for themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>or with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or I should have been as a hidden untimely birth, as infants that never saw light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There the prisoners are at ease together. They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The small and the great are there. And the servant is free from his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hid treasures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the grave?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God has hedged in?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings are poured out like water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the thing which I fear comes upon me, and that which I am afraid of comes to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, neither have I rest, but trouble comes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
