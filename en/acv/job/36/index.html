For I have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my maker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>(For truly my words are not false.) He who is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise. He is mighty in strength of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He does not preserve the life of the wicked, but gives to the afflicted [their] right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but he sets them forever with kings upon the throne, and they are exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if they be bound in fetters, and be taken in the cords of afflictions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He also opens their ear to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If they hearken and serve [him], they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if they do not hearken, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. They do not cry for help when he binds them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They die in youth, and their life [perishes] among the unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear in oppression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress into a broad place, where there is no confinement, and that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thou have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and there shall be wrath upon the impious because of the ungodliness of bribes which the unrighteous receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Will thy cry not avail in distress, or all the forces of strength?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not desire the night, when peoples are cut off in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Take heed. Do not turn to iniquity, for thou have fixed on this because of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, God does loftily in his power. Who is a teacher like him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who has enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou have wrought unrighteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Remember that thou magnify his work, of which men have sung.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>All men have looked on it. Man beholds it afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold, God is great, and we do not know him. The number of his years is unsearchable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For he draws up the drops of water, which distil in rain from his vapor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>which the skies pour down and drop upon man abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Behold, he spreads his light around him, and he covers the bottom of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For by these he judges the peoples. he gives food in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He covers his hands with the lightning, and gives it a command that it strike the mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The noise of it tells concerning him. The cattle also concerning [the storm] that comes up.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
