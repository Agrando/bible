Truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him who called you in the grace of Christ to another good-news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is not another, except there are some who confuse you, and who want to pervert the good-news of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we, or an agent from heaven, should preach a good-news to you contrary to what we preached to you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, I now also say again, if any man preaches a good-news to you contrary to what ye received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For do I now trust men or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I were still pleasing men I would not be a bondman of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I make known to you, brothers, the good-news that was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it was through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For ye heard of my former behavior in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God to extraordinariness, and ravaged it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my race, being a more extreme zealot of my paternal traditions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's belly, and called me through his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son in me, so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not straightaway confer with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I did not see another of the apostles except James the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now what I write to you, behold before God, I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Later I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I was unknown by face to the congregations of Judea in Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but they were only hearing that the man who once persecuted us now preaches the good-news, the faith that he once ravaged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
