Ye have fallen from grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For we, in a Spirit of faith, wait for a hope of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye were running well. Who hindered you, not to obey the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have confidence toward you in Lord, that ye will think no other thing. But the man who troubles you will bear the verdict, whoever he may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of the cross has been abolished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>O that those who trouble you would even cut it all off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For ye, brothers, were called to liberty, only not liberty for an opportunity to the flesh, but be servants to each other through love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if ye bite and devour each other, watch out that ye be not consumed by each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I say, walk in Spirit and ye will, no, not fulfill a lust of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit is against the flesh. For these are hostile to each other, so that whatever these things are ye may want, ye may not do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if ye are led by Spirit ye are not under law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are apparent, which are, adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strifes, jealousies, wraths, selfish ambitions, dissentions, factions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envyings, murders, intoxications, revelings, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, as I also did forewarn, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And those of the Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and the lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live in Spirit, we should also march in Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not become conceited, provoking each other, envying each other.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
