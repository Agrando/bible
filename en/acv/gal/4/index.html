Ye wronged me in nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But ye know that through a weakness of the flesh I preached the good-news to you the first time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ye did not disdain, nor did ye reject my trial in my flesh, but ye received me as an agent of God, as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where then is your satisfaction? For I testify to you, that if possible, having plucked your eyes out, ye would have given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then have I become your enemy telling you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are zealous for you but not honorably. They want to exclude you, so that ye may be zealous for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But to be zealous of is always good in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, of whom I suffer birth pains again until Christ is formed in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I was wishing to be present with you now and to change my tone, because I am perplexed at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me those desiring to be under law, do ye not hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one from the servant girl, and one from the freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But in fact, the man from the servant girl was born according to flesh, but the man from the freewoman through promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things are allegorized, for these are two covenants, indeed one from mount Sinai giving birth for bondage, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and it corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren woman not giving birth. Burst forth and shout, thou not suffering birth pains, because many more are the children of the desolate than of her who has the husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we, brothers, who correspond to Isaac, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But just as then, the man who was born according to flesh persecuted the man according to Spirit, so also now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? Send away the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will, no, not inherit with the son of the freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brothers, we are not children of a servant girl, but of the freewoman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
