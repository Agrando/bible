Now turn away from these men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for from these are those who creep into houses, and take captive petty women laden with sins, being led away by various impulses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>ever learning and never able to come to knowledge of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And by which way Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also do these oppose the truth.
