Therefore with loving kindness I have drawn thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again I will build thee, and thou shall be built, O virgin of Israel. Again thou shall be adorned with thy tambourine, and shall go forth in the dances of those who make merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again thou shall plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria. The planters shall plant, and shall enjoy [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion to LORD our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For thus says LORD: Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations. Publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the outermost parts of the earth, [and] with them the blind man and the lame man, the woman with child, and she who travails with child together. They shall ret</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall come with weeping. And I will lead them with supplications. I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not stumble. For I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For LORD has ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow to the goodness of LORD, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd. And their soul shall be as a watered gard</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the virgin shall rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together, for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus says LORD: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping. Rachel weeping for her children, she refused to be comforted for her children, because they are not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says LORD: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, says LORD, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there is hope for thy latter end, says LORD, and [thy] sons shall come again to their own border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [saying], Thou have chastised me, and I was chastised as a calf unaccustomed [to the yoke]. Turn thou me back, and I shall be turned back, for thou are LORD my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Surely after that I was turned back. I repented, and after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh. I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still. Therefore my heart yearns for him. I will surely have mercy upon him, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Set thee up road marks. Make thee guideposts. Set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou went. Turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>How long will thou go here and there, O thou backsliding daughter? For LORD has created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Yet again they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof when I shall bring again their captivity: LORD bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell in there together, the husbandmen, and those who go about with flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul I have replenished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Upon this I awoke, and beheld, and my sleep was sweet to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, the days come, says LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall come to pass that, just as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In those days they shall no more say, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the son's teeth are set on edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But everyone shall die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days come, says LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant, and I disregarded (LXX/NT) them, says LORD</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says LORD: I will give my laws (LXX/NT) in their inward parts, and I will write them (LXX/NT) in their hearts. And I will be their God, and th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know LORD, for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus says LORD, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar. LORD of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If these ordinances depart from before me, says LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus says LORD: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, the days come, says LORD, that the city shall be built to LORD from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields, to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to LORD. It shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
