Then Jeremiah said to him, LORD has not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Bab</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains of it, and all the precious things of it, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies. And they shall make them a prey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou, Pashhur, and all who dwell in thy house shall go into captivity. And thou shall come to Babylon, and there thou shall die, and there thou shall be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou have prophesied falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O LORD, thou have persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou are stronger than I, and have prevailed. I have become a laughing-stock all the day; everyone mocks me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For as often as I speak, I cry out. I cry, Violence and destruction! Because the word of LORD is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, [say] all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall.
