And thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shall go to Babyl</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet hear the word of LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah. Thus says LORD concerning thee, Thou shall not die by the sword;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>thou shall die in peace. And with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee. And they shall lament thee, [saying], Ah lord! For I have spoken the word, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah, king of Judah in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah, for these [alone] remained of the cities of Judah, fortified cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The word that came to Jeremiah from LORD, after the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free, that none should make bondmen of them, [namely], of a Jew his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the rulers and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his man-servant, and everyone his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondmen of them any more.
