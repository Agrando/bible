For [a man] cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They deck it with silver and with gold. They fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it not move.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and do not speak. They must be carried, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, nor is it in them to do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is none like thee, O LORD. Thou are great, and thy name is great in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? For to thee it appertains, inasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they are together brutish and foolish, the instruction of idols! It is but a block of wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith, blue and purple for their clothing. They are all the work of skilful men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But LORD is the TRUE God. He is the living God, and an everlasting King. At his wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus ye shall say to them: The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He has made the earth by his power. He has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he has stretched out the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every man has become brutish, without knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image. For his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are vanity, a work of delusion. In the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The portion of Jacob is not like these. For he is the former of all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance. LORD of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou who abides in the siege.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is grievous, but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken. My sons have gone forth from me, and they are not. There is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the shepherds have become brutish, and have not inquired of LORD. Therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The voice of news. Behold, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself. It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O LORD, correct me, but in measure, not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name. For they have devoured Jacob. Yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
