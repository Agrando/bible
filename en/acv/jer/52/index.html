And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For it came to pass through the anger of LORD, in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army against Jerusalem, and encamped against it. And they built forts a</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden, (now the Chaldeans were against the city round a</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he gave judgment upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the rulers of Judah in Riblah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah. And the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he burned the house of LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem. Even every great house, he burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the pillars of brass that were in the house of LORD, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the cups, and the fire pans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls--that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver--the captain of the guard took away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of LORD--the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits encompassed it, and the thickness of it was four fingers; it was hollow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And a capital of brass was upon it. And the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass.

So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: In the seventh year three thousand twenty-three Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five persons.

And he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
