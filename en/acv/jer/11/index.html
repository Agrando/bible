Then I answered, and said, Amen, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And LORD said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked each one in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And LORD said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus says LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape. And they shall cry to me, but I will not hearken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah, and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem ye have set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore do not pray thou for this people, nor lift up cry nor prayer for them, for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has wrought lewdness [with] many, and the holy flesh has passed from thee? When thou do evil, then thou rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair with goodly fruit. With the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For LORD of hosts, who planted thee, has pronounced evil against thee because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And LORD gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it. Then thou showed me their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. And I knew not that they had devised devices against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with the fruit of it. And let us cut him off from the land of the living, that hi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, who tries the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them, for to thee I have revealed my case.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek thy life, saying, Thou shall not prophesy in the name of LORD, that thou not die by our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus says LORD of hosts: Behold, I will punish them.
