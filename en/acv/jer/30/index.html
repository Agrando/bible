Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it. It is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, says LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds. And strangers shall no more make him their bondman,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but they shall serve LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, says LORD, nor be dismayed, O Israel. For, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity, and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am with thee, says LORD, to save thee. For I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee. But I will correct thee in measure, and will in no way leave thee unpun</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says LORD, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is none to plead thy cause, that thou may be bound up; thou have no healing medicines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All who love thee have forgotten thee; they seek thee not. For I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why do thou cry for thy hurt? Thy pain is incurable, for the greatness of thine iniquity. Because thy sins were increased, I have done these things to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all those who devour thee shall be devoured, and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity. And those who despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all who prey upon thee I will give for a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health to thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, says LORD, because they have called thee an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus says LORD: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places. And the city shall be built upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry. And I will multiply them, and they shall not be few. I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their sons also shall be as formerly, and their congregation shall be established before me. And I will punish all who oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them. And I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me. For who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the tempest of LORD--wrath--has gone forth, a sweeping tempest. It shall burst upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of LORD shall not return until he has executed, and till he has performed the intents of his heart. In the latter days ye shall understand it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
