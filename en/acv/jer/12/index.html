Yet I would reason the case with thee. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all those at ease who deal very treacherously?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou have planted them. Yea, they have taken root, they grow. Yea, they bring forth fruit. Thou are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But thou, O LORD, know me. Thou see me, and try my heart toward thee. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds, because they said, He shall not see our latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If thou have run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how can thou contend with horses? And though in a land of peace thou are secure, yet how will thou do in the pride of the Jordan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For even thy brothers, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee, even they have cried aloud after thee. Believe them not, though they speak fair words to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have forsaken my house. I have cast off my heritage. I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest. She has uttered her voice against me. Therefore I have hated her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field; bring them to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard. They have trodden my portion under foot. They have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have made it a desolation. It mourns to me, being desolate. The whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Destroyers have come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness. For the sword of LORD devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land. No flesh has peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns. They have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing. And ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says LORD against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them. And I will bring them again, each man to his heritage, and each man to his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As LORD lives, even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
