Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But go ye now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, because ye have done all these works, says LORD. And I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not, and I called you, but ye answered not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore I will do to the house, which is called by my name, in which ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore pray thou not for this people, nor lift up cry nor prayer for them. Neither make intercession to me, for I will not hear thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>See thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The sons gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do they provoke me to anger? says LORD, [and] not themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore thus says lord LORD: Behold, my anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground. And it shall burn, and shall not be quen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus says LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken to my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people. And walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in [their own] counsels, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet they hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff. They did worse than their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thou shall speak all these words to them, but they will not hearken to thee. Thou shall also call to them, but they will not answer thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And thou shall say to them, This is the nation that has not hearkened to the voice of LORD their God, nor received instruction. Truth has perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Cut off thy hair, [O Jerusalem], and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights. For LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, says LORD. They have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, says LORD, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter. For they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place [to bury].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth, and none shall frighten them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
