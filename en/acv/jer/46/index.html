Furbish the spears. Put on the coats of mail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why have I seen it? They are dismayed and have turned backward. And their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and do not look back. Terror is on every side, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape. In the north by the river Euphrates they have stumbled and fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who is this that rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Egypt rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers. And he says, I will rise up. I will cover the earth. I will destroy cities and the inhabitants thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go up, ye horses, and rage, ye chariots. And let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, who handle the shield, and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For that day is [a day] of the Lord, LORD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries. And the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood, for the Lord, LORD of hosts, has</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt. In vain do thou use many medicines; there is no healing for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry. For the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty; they are fallen, both of them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The word that LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes. Say ye, Stand forth, and prepare thee, for the sword has devoured round about thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why are thy strong ones swept away?

For Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Egypt is a very fair heifer, [but] destruction out of the north has come, it has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall, for they also are turned back. They have fled away together. They did not stand, for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The sound thereof shall go like the serpent, for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall cut down her forest, says LORD, though it cannot be searched because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame.
