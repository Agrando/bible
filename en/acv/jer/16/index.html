They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground. And they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine. And their dead bodies shall be food fo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thus says LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, nor go to lament, nor bemoan them, for I have taken away my peace from this people, says LORD, even loving kindness and tender mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Both great and small shall die in this land.
