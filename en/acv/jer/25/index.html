But ye have not hearkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And LORD has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>saying, Return ye now each one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that LORD has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands. And I will do you no hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet ye have not hearkened to me, says LORD, that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus says LORD of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants of it, and against all these nations roun</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment. And these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, says LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and I will make it desolate forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them, and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says LORD, the God of Israel, to me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I took the cup at LORD's hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom LORD had sent me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings of it, and the rulers of it, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his rulers, and all his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all who have the corners [of their hair] cut off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thou shall say to them, Thus says LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then thou shall say to them, Thus says LORD of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished. For I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say to them, LORD will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation. He will mightily roar against his fold. He will give a shout, as those who tread [gra</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>A noise shall come even to the end of the earth, for LORD has a controversy with the nations. He will enter into judgment with all flesh. As for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus says LORD of hosts: Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the outermost parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the slain of LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be lamented, nor gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wail, ye shepherds, and cry. And wallow, ye principal men of the flock. For the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal men of the flock to escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal men of the flock! For LORD lays waste their pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He has left his covert as the lion. For their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing [sword], and because of his fierce anger.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
