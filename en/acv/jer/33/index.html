And I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them as at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. And I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me, and by which they have transgressed against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And [this city] shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says LORD: Yet again there shall be heard in this place--of which ye say, It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inh</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, Give thanks to LORD of hosts, for LORD is good, for his loving kindness [is] forever, [and of those] wh</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says LORD of hosts: Yet again there shall be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks shall again pass under the han</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the days come, says LORD, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely.
