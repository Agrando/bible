It is engraved upon the tablet of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>while their sons remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees upon the high hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil, [and] thy high places, because of sin, throughout all thy borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And thou, even of thyself, shall discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee, and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou know not. For ye have kindled a fire in my anger which shall burn forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says LORD: Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed is the man who trusts in LORD, and whose trust LORD is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat comes, but its leaf shall be green, and shall not be worried in the year of drought, nor shall cease from yieldi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt. Who can know it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I, LORD, search the mind. I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As the partridge that sits on [eggs] which she has not laid, so is he who gets riches, and not by right. In the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A glorious throne, [set] on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O LORD, the hope of Israel, all who forsake thee shall be put to shame. Those who depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken LORD, the fountain of living waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed. Save me, and I shall be saved, for thou are my praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of LORD? Let it come now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee, nor have I desired the woeful day. Thou know.

Thou are my refuge in the day of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let them be put to shame who persecute me, but let me not be put to shame. Let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed. Bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus LORD said to me, Go, and stand in the gate of the sons of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And say to them, Hear ye the word of LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter in by these gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus says LORD: Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, nor do ye any work. But hallow ye the Sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken to me, says LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to hallow the Sabbath day, to do no work in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then there shall enter in by the gates of this city kings and rulers sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their rulers, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
