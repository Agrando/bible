And, behold, the sash was rotten. It was good for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus says LORD, After this manner I will mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this sash, which is good for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For as the sash clings to the loins of a man, so I have caused to cling to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, says LORD, that they may be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore thou shall speak to them this word. Thus says LORD, the God of Israel: Every bottle shall be filled with wine. And they shall say to thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then thou shall say to them, Thus says LORD: Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkennes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says LORD. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hear ye, and give ear, be not proud, for LORD has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Give glory to LORD your God, before he causes darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains. And, while ye look for light, he turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for [your] pride. And my eye shall weep greatly, and run down with tears, because LORD's flock is taken captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Say thou to the king and to the queen-mother: Humble yourselves. Sit down, for your coronets have come down, even the crown of your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them. Judah is carried away captive, all of it. It is wholly carried away captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Lift up your eyes, and behold those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What will thou say when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou thyself have taught to be friends to thee? Shall not sorrows take hold of thee as of a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if thou say in thy heart, Why have these things come upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity thy skirts are uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then ye also may do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I will scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is thy lot, the portion measured to thee from me, says LORD, because thou have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I will also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills, in the field. Woe to thee, O Jerusalem! Thou will not be made clean. How long shall it yet be?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
