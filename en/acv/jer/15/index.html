Cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it shall come to pass, when they say to thee, Where shall we go forth? Then thou shall tell them, Thus says LORD: Such as are for death, to death, and such as are for the sword, to the sword, and such as are for the famine, to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will appoint over them four kinds, says LORD: the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? Or who will bemoan thee? Or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou have rejected me, says LORD. Thou have gone backward. Therefore I have stretched out my hand against thee, and destroyed thee. I am weary with relenting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land. I have bereaved [them] of sons. I have destroyed my people. They did not return from their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their widows have increased to me above the sand of the seas. I have brought upon them, against the mother of the young men, a destroyer at noonday. I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She who has borne seven, languishes. She has given up the spirit. Her sun has gone down while it was yet day. She has been put to shame and confounded. And the residue of them I will deliver to the sword before their enemies, says</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe is me, my mother, that thou have bore me, a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, nor have men lent to me, [yet] every one of them curses me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>LORD said, Truly I will strengthen thee for good. Truly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a man break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thy substance and thy treasures I will give for a spoil without price. And that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make [them] to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou know not. For a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O LORD, thou know. Remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors. Take me not away in thy longsuffering. Know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thy words were found, and I ate them. And thy words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart. For I am called by thy name, O LORD, God of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I did not sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor did I rejoice. I sat alone because of thy hand, for thou have filled me with indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? Will thou indeed be to me as a deceitful [brook], as waters that fail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says LORD: If thou return, then I will bring thee again that thou may stand before me. And if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shall be as my mouth. They shall return to thee, but thou shall not retur</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will make thee to this people a fortified brazen wall. And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee. For I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
