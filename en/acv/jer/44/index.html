And, behold, this day they are a desolation. And no man dwells therein</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, [and] to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>However I sent all my servants the prophets to you, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore now thus says LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do ye commit [this] great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none rema</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>in that ye provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where ye have gone to sojourn, that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They are not humbled even to this day. Neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus says LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will take the remnant of Judah, who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed.
