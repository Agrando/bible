T</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them, says LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moreover thou shall say to them, Thus says LORD: Shall men fall, and not rise up again? Shall he turn away, and not return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why then has this people of Jerusalem slid back by a perpetual backsliding? They hold firm deceit. They refuse to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I hearkened and heard, but they did not speak aright. No man repents of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Everyone turns to his course as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yea, the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times, and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming, but my people know not the law of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How can ye say, We are wise, and the law of LORD is with us? But, behold, the FALSE pen of the scribes has wrought falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The wise men are put to shame. They are dismayed and taken. Lo, they have rejected the word of LORD, and what manner of wisdom is in them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who shall possess them. For everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness. From the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they have lightly healed the hurt of the daughter of my people, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor could they blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall. In the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will utterly consume them, says LORD. There shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade, and [things] I have given them shall pass away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there. For LORD our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We looked for peace, but no good came, for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan. At the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles. For they have come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it, the city and those who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! My heart is faint within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: Is not LORD in Zion? Is not her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with foreign vanities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the hurt of the daughter of my people I am hurt. I mourn. Dismay has taken hold on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
