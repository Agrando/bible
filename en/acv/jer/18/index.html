Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>At that instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from their evil, I will relent of the evil that I thought to do to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And at that instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they obey not my voice, then I will relent of the good with which I said I would benefit them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says LORD: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you. Return ye now everyone from his evil way, and amend your ways</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But they say, It is in vain. For we will walk after our own devices, and we will do everyone according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says LORD: Ask ye now among the nations, Who has heard such things? The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? [Or] shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For my people have forgotten me. They have burned incense to FALSE [gods]. And they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shake his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy. I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they said, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah. For the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not gi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of those who contend with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall evil be recompensed for good? For they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore deliver up their sons to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword, and let their wives become childless, and widows, and let their men be slain of death, [and] their young men smitten of the sword in battl</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shall bring a troop suddenly upon them, for they have dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet, LORD, thou know all their counsel against me to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee. Deal thou with them in the time of thine anger.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
