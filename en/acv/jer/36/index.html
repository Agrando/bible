And Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of LORD, which he had spoken to him, upon a roll of a book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up. I cannot go into the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou have written from my mouth, the words of LORD in the ears of the people in LORD's house upon the fast-day. And also thou shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It may be they will present their supplication before LORD, and will return each one from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that LORD has pronounced against this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of LORD in LORD's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber. And, lo, all the rulers were sitting there: Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Z</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore all the rulers sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll from which thou have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Ner</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did thou write all these words at his mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the rulers said to Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah, and let no man know where ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went in to the king into the court, but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they told all the words in the ears of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe.
