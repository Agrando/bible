Behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds, and they shall be fruitful and multiply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will set up shepherds over them who shall feed them. And they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed. Neither shall any be lacking, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, the days come, says LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely. And this is his name by which he shall be called: LORD our righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, says LORD, that they shall no more say, As LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but, As LORD lives, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Concerning the prophets: My heart within me is broken. All my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of LORD, and because of his holy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the land is full of adulterers. For because of swearing the land mourns. The pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both prophet and priest are profane. Yea, in my house I have found their wickedness, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness. They shall be driven on, and fall in it. For I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria. They prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing. They commit adultery, and walk in lies. And they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none returns from his wickedness. They have all of them become to me as So</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus says LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall. For from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone forth into all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says LORD of hosts: Hearken not to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They teach you vanity. They speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say continually to those who despise me, LORD has said, Ye shall have peace. And to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For who has stood in the council of LORD, that he should perceive and hear his word? Who has marked my word, and heard it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, the tempest of LORD, wrath, has gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest. It shall burst upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of LORD shall not return until he has executed, and till he has performed the intents of his heart. In the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I did not send these prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my council, then they would have caused my people to hear my words, and would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Am I a God at hand, says LORD, and not a God afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can any man hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? says LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream. And he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is not my word like fire? says LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says LORD, who steal my words each one from his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I am against the prophets, says LORD, who use their tongues, and say, He says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says LORD, and tell them. And cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting. Yet I sent them not, nor commanded them, neither do they profit this people at al</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of LORD? Then thou shall say to them, What burden! I will cast you off, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, The burden of LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus ye shall say each one to his neighbor, and each one to his brother: What has LORD answered? and, What has LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the burden of LORD ye shall mention no more, for every man's own word shall be his burden. For ye have perverted the words of the living God, of LORD of hosts our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus thou shall say to the prophet: What has LORD answered thee? and, What has LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if ye say, The burden of LORD, therefore thus says LORD: Because ye say this word, The burden of LORD, and I have sent to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you. And I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
