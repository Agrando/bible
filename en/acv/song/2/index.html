A lily of the valleys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He brought me to the banquet house, and his banner over me was love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Sustain ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am sick from love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>His left hand [is] under my head, and his right hand embraces me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The voice of my beloved!

They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O my dove, who are in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place, let me see thy countenance; let me hear thy voice. For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards.
