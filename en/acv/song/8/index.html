[When] I should find thee outside, I would kiss thee. Yes, and none would despise me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I would lead thee, [and] bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me. I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His left hand under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awoke thee. There thy mother was in travail with thee. There she who brought thee forth was in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm. For love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as Sheol. The flashes of it are flashes of fire, a most vehement flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Many waters cannot quench love, nor can floods drown it. If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If she is a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver. And if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers. Then I was in his eyes as one who found peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon. He let out the vineyard to keepers. Every one for the fruit of it was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me. Thou, O Solomon, shall have the thousand, and those who keep the fruit of it, two hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou who dwell in the gardens, the companions hearken for thy voice. Cause me to hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
