Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skilful workman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thy body is a round goblet, no mingled wine is wanting. Thy waist is a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thy neck is like the tower of ivory. Thine eyes, the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple. The king is held captive in the tresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>How fair and how pleasant thou are, O love, for delights!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to its clusters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I said, I will climb up into the palm tree.

Let us lodge in the villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let us get up early to the vineyards. Let us see whether the vine has budded, its blossom is open, the pomegranates are in flower. There I will give thee my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The mandrakes give forth fragrance. And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
