Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thy neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, on which there hang a thousand bucklers, all the shields of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe, which feed among the lilies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou are all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Come with me from Lebanon, [my] bride, with me from Lebanon.
