I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey. I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends. Drink, yea. Drink abundantly, O beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was asleep, but my heart awoke. It is the voice of my beloved who knocks, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled. For my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door], and my heart was moved for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands drops with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone. My soul had failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him. I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The watchmen who go about the city found me. They smote me, they wounded me. The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him that I am sick from love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, that thou do so adjure us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head is the most fine gold. His locks are bushy, black as a raven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, washed with milk, fitly set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His cheeks are as a bed of spices, banks of sweet herbs. His lips are lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His hands are rings of gold set with beryl. His body is ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His legs are pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold. His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His mouth is most sweet. Yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
