And his commandments are not burdensome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because everything that has been begotten from God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And who is he who overcomes the world, if not he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And it is the Spirit that testifies, because the Spirit is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because those who testify are three:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. And the three are in one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. Because this is the testimony of God that he has testified about his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified about his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony, that God gave eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has the Son has the life. He who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I wrote these things to you, those who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he hears us, whatever we may ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man may see his brother sinning a sin not toward death, he will ask, and he will give life to him, to those not sinning toward death. There is sin toward death. I do not say that he should make request about that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All unrighteousness is sin. And there is sin not toward death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that every man who has been begotten from God does not sin, but he who was begotten from God keeps himself, and the evil does not touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is set in the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of God comes, and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true. And we are in the true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the TRUE God, and the eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Little children, guard yourselves from the idols. Truly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
