And this is that of the antichrist, which ye have heard that it comes, and is now in the world already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye are of God, little children, and ye have overcome them, because greater is he in you than he in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are of the world. Because of this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are of God. He who knows God hears us. He who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, we should love each other. Because love is of God, and every man who loves has been begotten of God, and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who does not love does not know God, because God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By this the love of God was made known in us, because God sent his Son, the only begotten, into the world so that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son, an atonement for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also are obligated to love each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man has ever seen God. If we love each other, God abides in us, and his love is in us, having been fully perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us from his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son, a Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we know, and have believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By this love has been fully perfected with us, so that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because just as that man is, we also are in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Fear is not in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear holds punishment, and he who is afraid has not been fully perfected in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love him, because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If any man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And we have this commandment from him, so that he who loves God will also love his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
