And how do ye see it now? Is it not in your eyes as nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says LORD, and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and be strong, all ye people of the land, says LORD, and work. For I am with you, says LORD of hosts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[according to] the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit abode among you. Fear ye not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus says LORD of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will shake all nations, and the precious things of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, says LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says LORD of hosts, and in this place I will give peace, says LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the twenty-fourth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus says LORD of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If a man bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touches bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Haggai said, If a man who is unclean because of a dead body touches any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, says LORD, and so is every work of their hands. And that which they offer there is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Through all that time, when a man came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were but ten. When he came to the wine vat to draw out fifty [vessels], there were but twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands, yet ye [turned] not to me, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Consider, I pray you, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month], since the day that the foundation of LORD's temple was laid, consider it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Is the seed yet in the barn? Yea, the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not brought forth. From this day I will bless [you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the word of LORD came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth [day] of the month, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. And the horses and their riders shall come down, each one b</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day, says LORD of hosts, I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, says LORD, and will make thee as a signet.
