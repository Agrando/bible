She received not correction. She trusted not in LORD. She did not draw near to her God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Her rulers in the midst of her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing till the morrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Her prophets are airy and treacherous men. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary.

He does not fail, but the unjust man knows no shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that none passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I said, Only fear thou me. Receive correction, so her dwelling shall not be cut off, [according to] all that I have appointed concerning her. But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore wait ye for me, says LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey. For my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them my indignation, even all my fierce anger. For all the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For then I will turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of LORD, to serve him with one consent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In that day thou shall not be put to shame for all thy doings, in which thou have transgressed against me.

For they shall feed and lay down, and none shall make them afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Sing, O daughter of Zion. Shout, O Israel. Be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>LORD has taken away thy judgments. He has cast out thine enemy.

And I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away, and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame has been in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that time I will bring you in, and at that time I will gather you.
