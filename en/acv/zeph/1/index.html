I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked. And I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, [and] the name of the Chemarim with the priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and those who worship the host of heaven upon the housetops, and those who worship, who swear to LORD and swear by Malcam,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and those who are turned back from following LORD, and those who have not sought LORD, nor inquired after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hold thy peace at the presence of lord LORD, for the day of LORD is at hand. For LORD has prepared a sacrifice. He has consecrated his guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall come to pass in the day of LORD's sacrifice, that I will punish the rulers, and the king's sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in that day I will punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in that day, says LORD, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone. All those who were laden with silver are cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on their lees, who say in their heart, LORD will not do good, nor will he do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation.
