I did nothing wrong Jewish, as thou also very well know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For if I am indeed wrong, and have done anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die, but if there is nothing of what these men accuse me, no man can give me to them freely. I appeal Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, when he conferred with the council, answered, Thou have appealed Caesar, to Caesar thou will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now some days having passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, greeting Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as he was remaining there more days, Festus declared to the King the things concerning Paul, saying, There is a certain man who was left behind a prisoner by Felix,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>about whom, when I became in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews revealed, asking judgment against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To whom I answered, that it is not a custom by Romans to give any man freely for destruction, before the man being accused has the accusers in person, and receives an occasion of defense about the accusation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When therefore they assembled here, not having made one delay, next in order, having sat on the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>About whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought not one cause of what I supposed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but had certain issues against him about his own religion, and about a certain Jesus, who has died, whom Paul was claiming to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I, being uncertain of the controversy about this man, asked whether he wants to go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Paul appealed to be kept for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, I also want to hear the man myself. And tomorrow, he says, thou will hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore on the morrow, Agrippa and Bernice having come with great pomp, and having entered into the courtroom, and with the chief captains and the men of prominence who were of the city, and Festus who commanded, Paul was brought</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus says, King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I, having understood him to have done nothing worthy of death, and also him, this man, having appealed Augustus I decided to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>About whom I do not have anything certain to write to the lord. Therefore I brought him before you, and especially before thee, king Agrippa, so that, an examination having occurred, I may have something to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seems to me unreasonable, sending a prisoner, and not to specify the causes against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
