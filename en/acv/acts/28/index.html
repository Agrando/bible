And while putting out to sea, they furnished the things for our necessities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after three months we set out in a ship that wintered at the island, an Alexandrian with The Twin Brothers emblem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after being brought down to Syracuse, we remained there three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>from where having made a circuit, we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day, wind from the south having developed, we came a second day to Puteoli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>where, having found brothers, we were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from there the brothers, who heard these things about us, came for a meeting with us as far as Appius Forum and The Three Taverns, whom, when Paul saw, having expressed thanks to God, he took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commandant, but Paul was allowed to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass after three days, for Paul to call together those who were the principle men of the Jews. And when they came together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I, having done nothing against the people, or the paternal c</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, after examining me, wanted to release me, because there was not one cause of death in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because of this reason therefore I summoned you to see and to speak with me, for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea about thee, nor did any of the brothers who came report or speak anything bad about thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we think it worthy to hear from thee what thou think. For indeed about this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having appointed a day for him, more came to him into his lodging, to whom he expounded, solemnly testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things about Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from m</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some were convinced by the things that were spoken, and some disbelieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And being discord among each other, they departed after Paul spoke one thing, saying, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>saying, Go thou to this people, and say, Hearing ye will hear, and will, no, not understand, and seeing ye will see, and will, no, not perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this people's heart was made fat, and they hear heavily with the ears. And they shut their eyes, lest they may perceive with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should turn, and I would heal the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be it known to you therefore, that the salvation of God was sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he said these things, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired lodging. And he received all who came in to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
