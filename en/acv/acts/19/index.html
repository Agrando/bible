And having found some disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>he said to them, Did ye receive Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said to him, But we have not even heard if there is a Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to them, Into what then were ye immersed? And they said, Into John's immersion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Paul said, John indeed immersed an immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when they heard this, they were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Paul having laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues, and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all the men were about twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And after entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for three months, discoursing and persuading the things about the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, having withdrawn from them, he separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this happened for two years, so as for all those dwelling in Asia to hear the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so as to even bring handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin to those who were incapacitated and to free their infirmities from them, and the evil spirits to go out from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But some of the wandering Jewish exorcists, attempted to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there were some sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, seven doing this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having answered, the evil spirit said, I know Jesus and I recognize Paul, but who are ye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man in whom was the evil spirit, leaping on them, and having overpowered them, he prevailed against them, so as for them to flee out of that house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, to those who dwell at Ephesus. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And many of those who have believed came, confessing, and reporting their practices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a considerable number of those who practiced magical things, having brought their books together, burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus the word of the Lord was growing mightily and was prevailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now when these things were fulfilled, Paul decided in the spirit, after passing through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, having said, After becoming there, I must also see Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having sent into Macedonia two of those who help him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And about that time there developed no small stir about the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For a certain silversmith named Demetrius who makes silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little work to the craftsmen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to whom also (having assembled the workmen about such things) he said, Men, ye know that our prosperity is from this work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all Asia, this man Paul, having persuaded them, turned away a considerable multitude, saying that there are no gods made by hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And not only is this our part liable to come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is going to be regarded for nothing, and also her magnificence be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when they heard this, having become full of wrath, they cried out, saying, The great Artemis of Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the whole city was filled with the confusion. And they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Paul wanted to enter in to the crowd, the disciples did not let him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And also some of the Asian officers, being their friends, having sent to him, implored him not to give himself into the theatre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Indeed therefore some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was confused, and most had not seen why they had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they urged forward Alexander out of the multitude, having put him forward from the Jews. And Alexander having waved his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But after recognizing that he was a Jew, one voice developed from them all, crying out for about two hours, The great Artemis of Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the town clerk calmed the multitude, he says, Ephesian men, now who is the man who does not know the city of the Ephesians being temple-guardian of the great goddess Artemis, and of what fell from Zeus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore these things being undeniable, ye ought to be restrained, and do nothing rash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For ye brought these men, who are neither sacrilegious nor blaspheming your goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Indeed therefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen with him, have a matter against any man, forums are brought, and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And if ye seek anything about other things, it will be decided in the assembly within law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we are also in danger to be accused about the uproar today, there being no cause about which we can give account of this commotion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
