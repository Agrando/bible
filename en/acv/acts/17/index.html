And having stood by the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the populace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And not having found them, they dragged Jason and some brothers to the city rulers, shouting, The men who have agitated the world, these are present here also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>whom Jason has received. And all these men are acting against the decrees of Caesar, asserting another man to be king, Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they disturbed the multitude and the city rulers when they heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And after taking bond from Jason and the other men, they released them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the brothers straightaway sent both Paul and Silas away through the night to Berea, who, when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all willingness, examining the Scriptures daily, if it has these things this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Indeed therefore many of them believed, also of the prominent Greek women, and of men, not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when the Jews of Thessalonica also learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea, they came there also, agitating the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But then straightaway the brothers sent Paul away to go as far as to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And those who brought Paul led him as far as Athens. And after taking a command for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him quickly, they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But while Paul waited for them in Athens, his spirit was aroused within him, seeing the city being completely idolatrous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Indeed therefore he was discoursing in the synagogue with the Jews, and with those who worship, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, Whatever does this babbler want to say? But others, He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities, because he brought the good-news--Jesus and t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having taken him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying, Can we understand what this new doctrine is, being spoken by thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thou bring some surprising things to our ears. Therefore, we want to know whatever these things aim to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now all the Athenians, and the foreigners who dwell alien there, were at leisure in nothing else, than to tell or to hear something new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having stood in the middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Athenian men, I perceive you as deity-fearing in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, passing through and examining your religious objects, I also found an altar on which had been engraved, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye worship unknowingly, him I proclaim to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor is he served by the hands of men, as needing anything, since he himself gives to all life, and breath, with all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined prescribed times, and the limits of their occupancy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to search for the Lord, if indeed perhaps they might grope for him and find him, although being not far from each one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in him we live, and move, and exist, as also some of the performers from you have said, For of him we are also offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being therefore offspring of God, we ought not think the Divine to be like gold, or silver, or stone handiwork of the skill and thought of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Indeed therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands for all men everywhere to repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he appointed a day during which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he appointed, having provided assurance to all men because he raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when they heard the resurrection of the dead, of course they mocked, but others said, We will hear thee again about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And so Paul departed from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some men, having joined with him, believed, among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
