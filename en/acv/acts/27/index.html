And Julius, who treated Paul kindly, allowed him to undergo care, after going to his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And having launched from there, we sailed under lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And having sailed across the depths along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, of Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there, the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, he put us in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And sailing slowly during considerable days, and with difficulty having come along the Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under lee of Crete, along Salmone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And sailing by it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was Lasea City.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And considerable time having past, and the voyage now being dangerous, also because the Fast was now past, Paul urged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>saying to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage is going to be with injury and much damage, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the centurion was convinced more by the captain and the shipmaster than to those things spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And since the haven was inconvenient to winter in, the majority gave counsel to launch from there also, if somehow they might be able, after arriving at Phoenix, to winter in a haven of Crete, looking toward southwest and northwest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when a south wind blew gently, having presumed to have obtained their purpose, after taking up anchor, they sailed very near by Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after, there threw against it a cyclonic wind called the Euroclydon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the ship having been caught, and not being able to face the wind, having given up, we were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And having sailed under lee of a certain island called Clauda, we were able with difficulty, to develop control of the skiff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having taken that up, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they might fall off into the sandbank, having lowered the vessel, they were driven this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And since we were exceedingly storm-tossed, on the next day they jettisoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the third day we cast out by hands the tackling of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when neither sun nor stars appeared for more days, and no small storm laying on, all remaining hope for us to be saved was taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And being long without food, then Paul, who stood in the midst of them, said, Ye truly ought, O men, to have complied with me, not to launch from Crete, and gain this damage and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will not be one loss of life from you, except of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there stood by me this night an agent of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Fear not, Paul. Thou must stand before Caesar, and lo, God has granted thee all those sailing with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore men, cheer up, for I believe God, that it will be so in that way it has been told to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But we must fall off upon a certain island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when it became the fourteenth night, as we were driven about in the Adriatic sea, toward midnight the sailors suspected some region to come near them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having tossed lead, they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and having tossed lead again, they found fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And fearing lest somehow we might falloff on rough places, having cast off four anchors from the stern, they prayed for day to develop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And since the sailors sought to flee out of the ship, and having lowered the skiff into the sea in pretense as going to stretch out anchors from the bow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff, and let it fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And until day was going to develop, Paul urged them all to partake of food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day, waiting, ye continue without food, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore I encourage you to take of food, for this is for your safety. For not a hair will fall from the head of one of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having said these things, and having taken bread, he expressed thanks to God in the presence of all. And having broke in pieces, he began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they all, having become encouraged, also took food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And all the souls in the ship were two hundred seventy-six.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And after being filled of food, they unloaded the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it became day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay having a beach, onto which, they decided if possible, to drive the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having cast off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time unfastening the bands of the rudders. And having hoisted up the foresail to the wind, they held firm for the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And having chanced upon a place where two seas meet, they ran the ship aground. And of course, the bow having become stuck, it remained immovable, but the stern was coming apart by the force of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And a decision of the soldiers developed that they should kill the prisoners, lest any man, having swam away, might escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, prevented them from their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, having first jumped out, to go to the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the remaining, some on boards, and some on any of the things from the ship. And so it came to pass for all to be saved to the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
