And it was bewildered because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they were amazed and marveled, saying to each other, Behold, are not all these men who speak Galileans?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And how do we each hear our own language in which we were born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, and Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya along Cyrene, and those Roman aliens, including Jews and proselytes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Cretes and Arabians. We hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, others saying to others, Whatever does this intend to be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others, mocking said, They are filled of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter having stood up with the eleven, raised his voice and spoke out to them, saying, Jewish men, and all who dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my sayings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For these men are not drunken, as ye suppose, for it is the third hour of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it will be in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh. And your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your elders will dream dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And also on my bondmen and on my bondmaids in those days I will pour out from my Spirit, and they will prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun will be changed into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and wonderful day of Lord comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will be, that every man, whoever may call on the name of Lord will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Men, Israelites, hear ye these words. Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>this man, having been designated (by the purpose and foreknowledge of God) a man delivered up, ye, having taken by lawless hands, killed, having crucified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David speaks for him: I beheld the Lord always before me, because he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Because of this my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad. And moreover my flesh will also rest in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because thou will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will thou give thy Holy man to see decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou made known to me the paths of life. Thou will fill me of joy with thy countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Men, brothers, being permitted to speak to you with openness about the patriarch David, that he both perished and was buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, to raise the Christ from the fruit of his loins according to flesh to sit upon his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul was not left behind in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus, God raised up, of which we are all witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this that ye now see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made him, this Jesus whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now having heard this, they were pierced in the heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles, Men, brothers, what will we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter said to them, Repent ye, and be immersed each of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all those in afar, as many as Lord our God may call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many more other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this crooked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Indeed therefore those who received his word gladly, were immersed. And there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they were continuing steadfastly in the apostles doctrine, and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and the prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear developed in every soul. And many wonders and signs occurred through the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all who believed were together, and had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they sold properties and possessions, and divided them to all, according as any man had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And continuing steadfastly, daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of nourishment in gladness and evenness of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God, and having favor with the whole populace. And the Lord was adding to the church daily those being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
