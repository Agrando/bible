And having brought a certain part, he placed it at the apostles' feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Peter said, Ananias, why did Satan fill thy heart for thee to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back from the price of the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>While it remained, did it not remain to thee? And after it was sold, it was in thine authority. Why is it that thou have placed this matter in thy heart? Thou have not lied to men, but to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Ananias hearing these words, after falling down he expired. And great fear developed in all who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And after rising the young men wrapped him, and having carried him out they buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass after an interval of three hours, his wife also came in, not knowing that which happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Peter responded to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Peter said to her, How is it that it was agreed by you to challenge the Spirit of Lord? Behold, the feet of those who buried thy husband are at the door, and they will carry thee out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And immediately she fell down at his feet and expired. And after coming in the young men found her dead, and having carried her out, they buried her by her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear developed in the whole church, and in all who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders happened among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But of the rest no man dared join them, but the people magnified them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And more who believe were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so as to bring the feeble to the thoroughfares, and to place them on cots and mats, so that while coming, the shadow of Peter might at the least overshadow some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And also the populace of the cities round about came together to Jerusalem bringing the feeble, and those tormented by unclean spirits, who were all healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But after rising up, the high priest and all those with him (being the sect of the Sadducees) were filled of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they threw their hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But an agent of Lord opened the prison doors by night, and after leading them out, he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go ye, and after standing in the temple, speak to the people all the sayings of this Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having heard, they entered into the temple at early morning, and taught. But the high priest having arrived, and those with him, they called the council together, and all the senate of the sons of Israel. And they sent to the p</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the subordinates who came did not find them in the prison. And having returned, they reported,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>saying, We found the prison indeed shut in all security, and the guards standing before the doors, but after opening, we found no man inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when they heard these words, the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests, were perplexed about them, whatever this would become.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But a certain man who arrived, reported to them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then after departing, the captain with the subordinates brought them, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they would be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And having brought them, they placed them in the council. And the high priest demanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, Did we not command by an order for you not to teach in this name? And behold, ye have filled Jerusalem of your doctrine, and intend to bring upon us this man's blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Peter and the apostles having answered, they said, We must obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye murdered, having hung on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>God exalted this man with his right hand, a Pathfinder and a Savior to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are his witnesses of these things, and also the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they heard this, they were as being split with a saw, and wanted to annihilate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But after standing up in the council, a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel, a law teacher, esteemed by all the people, commanded to make the apostles be outside a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves what ye are going to do against these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For before these days Theudas rose up saying himself to be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, bonded themselves, who was killed. And all, as many as were persuaded by him, were dispersed and developed into nothi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this man Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the registration, and drew a considerable crowd behind him. That man was also destroyed, and all, as many as were persuaded by him, were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I say to you, keep away from these men, and let them go, because if the project or this work is from men, it will be overthrown,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but if it is from God, ye cannot overthrow it, and perhaps ye may be found to be fighting against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they were persuaded by him. And after summoning the apostles, having beat them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Indeed therefore they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were considered worthy to be treated shamefully for the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they ceased not teaching and preaching good news, Jesus, the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
