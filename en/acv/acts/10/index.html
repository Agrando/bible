And he said to him, Thy prayers and thy charities have come up for a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This man lodges with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is beside the seaside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the heavenly agent speaking to Cornelius departed, having called two of his housemen, and a devout soldier of those who personally served him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and after reporting all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now on the morrow, while those men were traveling and approaching the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he became very hungry and wanted to eat. But while those men prepared, a trance fell upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he sees heaven opened, and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet bound at four corners, and being lowered to the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in which were all the four-footed things of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a voice came to him, After rising, Peter, kill and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, Not so, Lord, because I have never eaten anything profane or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a voice again for a second time, What God has cleansed, thou shall not make profane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this happened thrice, and again the vessel was taken up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now while Peter was bewildered in himself whatever the vision which he saw might be, that lo, the men who were sent from Cornelius, having inquired the house of Simon, stood at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after calling out they asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodges here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And while Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men seek thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But after rising, go down, and go with them, doubting nothing, because I have sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having gone down to the men, Peter said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek. What is the cause for which ye are here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man, and fearing God, and being well testified by the whole nation of the Jews, was divinely warned by a holy agent to summon thee to his house, and to hear sayings from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So, having invited them in, he lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went forth with them, and certain of the brothers from Joppa went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And on the morrow they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and close friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when it came about for Peter to enter, Cornelius, having met him, after falling down at his feet, worshiped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up. I am also myself a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he conversed with him, he went in and found many who came together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, Ye understand how it is unlawful for a Jewish man to fraternize or to visit with a foreign man, and yet God demonstrated to me not to call one man profane or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And so I came without objection when summoned. I ask therefore for what matter ye summoned me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour, and the ninth hour praying in my house. And behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he says, Cornelius, thy prayer was heard, and thy charities are remembered before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. This man lodges in the house of Simon, a tanner, beside the sea, who, after coming, will speak to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou did well having come. Now therefore we are all present in the sight of God, to hear all the things commanded thee by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having opened his mouth, Peter said, In truth, I am overwhelmed that God is not partial,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but in every nation, he who fears him, and works righteousness, is acceptable to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The word that he sent forth to the sons of Israel, preaching good-news, peace by Jesus Christ (this man is Lord of all),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>ye know, the word having occurred throughout the whole of Judea beginning from Galilee after the immersion that John preached--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus of Nazareth--how God anointed him with Holy Spirit and with power, who passed through doing good, and healing all those who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, whom also they killed, having hung on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>This man God raised up the third day, and granted him to become manifest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses who were previously chosen by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he arose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to solemnly testify that this is the man designated by God, Judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>To this man all the prophets testify, that every man who believes in him, to receive remission of sins through his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter still spoke these sayings, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the faithful men of circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because also on the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Can any man forbid the water for these not to be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain some days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
