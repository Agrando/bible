And on that day there developed a great persecution against the church at Jerusalem. And they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And devout men arranged to bury Stephen, and they made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul was ravaging the church, entering from house to house. Dragging both men and women, he gave them over to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Indeed therefore those who were scattered abroad passed through proclaiming the good-news, the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Philip, who went down to a city of Samaria, proclaimed the Christ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the multitudes unanimously heeded the things that were spoken by Philip during their listening and seeing the signs that he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For of many of those who had unclean spirits, they came out, crying in a great voice. And many who were paralyzed, and who were lame, were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there became great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a certain man in the city, Simon by name, was formerly practicing sorcery, and fascinating the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be some great man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to whom they gave heed, from small to great, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they heeded him, because he facinated them for a considerable time with the sorceries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip preaching good news, the things about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Simon himself also believed. And after being immersed, he was continuing with Philip. And seeing miracles and signs occurring, he was astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria has received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who, when they came down, prayed for them, so that they might receive Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for it was not yet fallen upon any of them. They were only immersed in the name of the Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid hands on them, and they received Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he brought money to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, Give me also this power, so that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, Thy silver with thee, may it be for destruction, because thou thought to obtain the gift of God by money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is no part nor lot for thee in this matter, for thy heart is not straight in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore from this thine evil, and beg God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart will be forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I perceive that thou are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having answered, Simon said, Beg ye to the Lord for me, so that none of which things ye have spoken may come upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Indeed therefore, having solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the good-news in many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And an agent of Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desolate region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after rising, he went. And behold a man, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a high official of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was returning, and sitting in his chariot, and reading the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and be joined to this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And after running near, Philip heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. And he said, Do thou also really understand the things that thou read?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, For how can I unless some man may guide me? And he encouraged Philip, after coming up, to sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb, mute before shearing him, thus he opened not his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his lowly condition his justice was taken away. And who will describe his generation, because his life was taken from the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having answered, the eunuch said to Philip, I ask thee, about whom does the prophet say this, about himself, or about some other man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Philip having opened his mouth, and having begun from this Scripture, he preached the good-news to him--the man Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch says, Look, water! What prevents me to be immersed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>\cf15\I [This verse in not in the majority of the manuscripts.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he immersed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they came up out of the water, Spirit of Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through all the cities he preached the good-news until he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
