Then Paul, having stretched forth his hand, made a defense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews, king Agrippa, I consider myself blessed, being about to make my defense before thee today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Especially thee, being an expert of all things regarding Jews, both habits and issues. Therefore I beg thee to hear me patiently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Indeed therefore, my manner of life from youth, having developed from the beginning among my nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>having known me previously from the beginning, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now for the hope of the promise made by God to the fathers, I stand being judged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to which our twelve tribes, serving in earnestness night and day, hope to attain, about which hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why is it judged incredible with you, if God raises the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Indeed therefore I thought it necessary for myself to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>which also I did at Jerusalem. And I locked up many of the sanctified in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests. And when they were killed, I gave a vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And punishing them often at all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme. And being extraordinarily furious toward them, I persecuted them even as far as to outside cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And during which, while going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>at midday, O king, I saw on the road a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, which shone around me and those who went with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do thou persecute me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I said, Who are thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But arise, and stand upon thy feet, for I appeared to thee for this, to appoint thee an assistant and a witness both of things that thou saw, and of the things that I will make visible to thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes to turn about from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, for them to receive remission of sins and a lot among those who have been sanctified by faith in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whereupon, king Agrippa, I did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but declaring first to those at Damascus and then at Jerusalem, and in all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, to repent and return to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because of these things the Jews, having seized me in the temple, tried to grasp and kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Having therefore experienced the help from God, I stand to this day solemnly declaring both to small and great, saying nothing apart from what both the prophets and Moses said was going to happen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the suffering Christ, since first from a resurrection of the dead, is going to proclaim light to our people and to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And while he made a defense by these things, Festus said in a loud voice, Paul, thou are mad. Much scholarship is driving thee into madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Paul says, I am not mad, eminent Festus, but I speak forth sayings of truth and soberness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king knows about these things, before whom I also speak boldly. For I am convinced not any of these things, nothing, to be hidden from him. For this was not done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, do thou believe the prophets? I know that thou believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Agrippa said to Paul, By a little thou persuade me to become a Christian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul said, I ever pray to God, both by little and by much, not only thee, but also all who hear me this day, to become such kind as I also am, apart from these bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when he spoke these things, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And having withdrawn, they spoke to each other, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been released, if he had not appealed Caesar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
