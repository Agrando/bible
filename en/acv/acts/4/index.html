And they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they had nothing to contradict.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But after commanding them to go outside of the council, they conferred among each other,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, What will we do to these men? For that indeed a notable sign has happened by them, is apparent to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But that it may not spread on further among the people, let us threaten them with threats to speak no longer in this name, to not one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And having called them, they commanded them entirely, not to utter nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John having replied to them, they said, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you rather than God, judge ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we are not able not to speak what we saw and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they, having further threatened, released them, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people. Since all glorified God for that which happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man was more than forty years old on whom this sign of healing had occurred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after being released, they went to their own men, and reported as many things as the chief priests and the elders said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And those who heard lifted up a voice to God with one accord, and said, Thou Master, the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who said through the mouth of thy boy David, Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For in truth, against thy holy Boy Jesus, whom thou anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do as many things as thy hand and thy purpose predetermined to happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>by thy stretching forth thy hand for healing, and signs and wonders to happen through the name of thy holy Boy Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. And not even one man said that anything of the things that was possessed by him was his own, but all things were common to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the apostles gave back the testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For not even any needy was among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling, they brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and placed them at the apostles' feet. And it was distributed to each, according as any man had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joses, who was surnamed by the apostles, Barnabas (which is, being translated, son of encouragement), a Levite, a Cypriot by nationality,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>having sold a field that was possessed by him, brought the money and placed it at the apostles' feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
