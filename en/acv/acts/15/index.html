And they caused great joy to all the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And after arriving in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders. And they reported as many things as God did with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But some of the men who believed from the sect of the Pharisees rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the apostles and the elders were assembled together to see about this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when much debate occurred, Peter having risen up, he said to them, Men, brothers, ye know that from past days among us, God chose the Gentiles to hear through my mouth the word of the good-news, and to believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God, who knows the heart, testified to them, having given them the Holy Spirit, just as also to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he made not one distinction between both us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore why do ye challenge God, to place a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we believe to be saved, in the same way as those men also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the multitude kept silent, and they heard Barnabas and Paul describing how many signs and wonders God did among the Gentiles through them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after they were quiet, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simeon described how God first came to help, to take from the Gentiles a people for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And to this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David that has fallen. And I will rebuild the things of it that have been demolished, and I will restore it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that the rest of men might seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called upon them, says the Lord, who does these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Known to God from the age are all his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore I judge not to trouble those from the Gentiles who are turning to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but to write to them, to abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses from generations past, has from city to city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it was decided by the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to send men chosen from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>after writing by their hand these things:The apostles, and the elders, and the brothers, to those down in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, to the brothers of the Gentiles, greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Since we have heard that certain men who went out from us have troubled you with words, disturbing your souls, saying to be circumcised, and to keep the law, to whom we did not command,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it was decided by us, having become unanimous, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men who have given over their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, themselves also declaring the same things by speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it was decided by the Holy Spirit, and by us, to lay upon you not one greater burden than these necessary things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, keeping yourselves from which, ye will do well.
