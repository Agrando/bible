And guards in front of the door guarded the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And behold, an agent of Lord stood near, and light shone in the room. And after striking the side of Peter, he raised him up, saying, Get up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the agent said to him, Gird thyself, and tie on thy sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Throw on thy garment, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And after going out, he followed him. And he had not seen that the thing happening by the heavenly agent was true, but presumed to see a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they passed a first and a second watch, they came to the iron gate, the one leading to the city, which opened spontaneously to them. And after going out, they advanced one street. And straightaway the agent withdrew from h</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when Peter came to himself, he said, Now I know truly, that Lord dispatched his agent and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And having realized it, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, surnamed Mark, where a considerable were gathered and praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Peter knocked the door of the gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after recognizing Peter's voice, she did not open the gate for joy, but having ran in, she reported Peter was standing in front of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they said to her, Thou are mad. But she insisted to have it so. But they said, It is his heavenly agent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him, and were astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But after motioning to them with the hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord brought him out of the prison.

And going down from Judea to Caesarea, he remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Herod was angry at the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came with one accord to him, and, having persuaded Blastus the man over the king's bedchamber, they requested peace, because their country was sustained from the monarchy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And at a set day Herod, having arrayed himself in royal apparel, and having sat on the tribunal, he made an oration to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the populace shouted, The voice of a god, and not of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And immediately an agent of Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God.
