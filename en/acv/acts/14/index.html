We also are men of like nature with you, proclaiming good-news to you, to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the thi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who in the generations that have passed allowed all the nations to go in their own ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>although he did not leave himself without evidence, doing good and giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts of food and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And saying these things, they scarcely restrained the multitudes not to sacrifice to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium.
