And ye will be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and as far as of the extremity of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And having said these things, as they were watching, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they were gazing at his going into the sky, behold, two men had also stood by them in white apparel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>who also said, Men, Galileans, why stand ye gazing into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into the sky will so come, in that same way as ye saw him going into the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem having a Sabbath day journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they came in, they went up into the upper floor where they were lodging, including, Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Juda</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All these men were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in those days, Peter, having stood up in the midst of the disciples (and there was a multitude of names at the same place, about a hundred twenty), he said</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men, brothers, it was necessary for this Scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold through the mouth of David about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because he was numbered with us, and received a share of this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Indeed therefore this man obtained a field from the reward of his unrighteousness, and having become headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known to all those dwelling at Jerusalem, so as to call that field in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation become desolate, and let no man be dwelling in it, and, Let another take his office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is necessary therefore, of the men who accompanied us during all the time during which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>having begun from the immersion of John to the day that he was taken up from us, for one of these to become a witness with us of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having prayed, they said, Thou, Lord, knowing the hearts of all men, show which one of these two thou have chosen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas transgressed to go to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they gave their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
