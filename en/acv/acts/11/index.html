And I saw the four footed things of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, kill and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But I said, Not so, Lord, because nothing profane or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a voice answered me for a second time out of heaven, What God has cleansed, thou shall not make profane.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this happened thrice, and all were drawn up again into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which I was, who were sent from Caesarea to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the man's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he informed us how he saw the heavenly agent in his house, who stood and said to him, Send forth men to Joppa, and summon Simon, the man surnamed Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who will speak sayings to thee, by which thou will be saved, thou and all thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the saying of Lord, how he said, John indeed immersed in water, but ye will be immersed in Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then God gave to them the identical gift as also to us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, but what power was I to hinder God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they heard these things, they relaxed and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Indeed therefore those who were scattered abroad from the persecution that occurred against Stephen passed through as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none except Jews only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And some of them were men, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who, having come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching good-news, the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the word about them was heard in the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they dispatched Barnabas to pass through as far as Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who, having arrived, and having seen the grace of God, rejoiced. And he encouraged all, with purpose of heart, to remain in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because he was a good man, and full of Holy Spirit and of faith. And a considerable multitude was added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabus departed to Tarsus to seek Saul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass a whole year for them to be assembled in the congregation, and to teach a considerable multitude, and to call the disciples Christians, first at Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of them named Agabus, after standing up, signified by the Spirit there was going be a great famine in the whole world, which also happened under Claudius Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the disciples, as any man prospered, determined, each of them regarding aid, to send to the brothers who dwell in Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>which also they did, having sent it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
