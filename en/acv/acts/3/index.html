In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, rise up and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up. And immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And leaping up, he stood and walked. And he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people saw him walking and praising God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and they recognized him, that this was the man who sat for charity at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. And they were filled of astonishment and amazement at that which happened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as the lame man who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Peter having seen, he responded to the people, Men, Israelites, why do ye marvel at this man? Or why do ye stare at us, as by our own power or piety we have made him to walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Boy Jesus, whom ye actually delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate who preferred to release that man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But ye denied the Holy and Righteous, and asked for a man, a murderer to be granted to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And ye killed the Pathfinder of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And by faith in his name, this man whom ye see and know, his name has made strong. And faith through him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, brothers, I know that ye did it from ignorance, as also your rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But this way God fulfilled what things were foretold, through the mouth of all his prophets, the Christ was to endure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Repent ye therefore, and be converted in order to wipe away your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he may send Christ Jesus who has been pre-ordained for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whom heaven must indeed receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of all his holy prophets from the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Moses indeed said to the fathers, Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you, from your brothers, like me. Ye shall hear him in all things, as many as he might speak to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And every soul, whichever it will be, if it will not hear that prophet will be utterly destroyed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And also all the prophets from Samuel and those in succession, as many as spoke, also proclaimed these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made for our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed all the patriarchies of the earth will be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To you first, having raised up his Boy Jesus, God sent him blessing you, in turning away each man from your evils.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
