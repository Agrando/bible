What is my iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeks my life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said to him, Far from it. Thou shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me, and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father knows well that I have found favor in thine eyes, and he says, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as LORD lives, and as thy soul lives, there is but a step betwe</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever thy soul desires, I will even do it for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said to Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat. But let me go that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If thy father misses me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city, for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If he says thus, It is well. Thy servant shall have peace. But if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore deal kindly with thy servant, for thou have brought thy servant into a covenant of LORD with thee. But if there be in me iniquity, kill me thyself, for why should thou bring me to thy father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee, for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would I not tell it to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then David said to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answers thee roughly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jonathan said to David, LORD, the God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to thee, and disclose it to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>LORD do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I not disclose it to thee, and send thee away that thou may go in peace. And LORD be with thee as he has been with my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shall not only show me the loving kindness of LORD, while I yet live, that I not die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but also thou shall not cut off thy kindness from my house forever. No, not when LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying], And LORD will require it at the hand of David's enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him. For he loved him as he loved his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon, and thou will be missed because thy seat will be empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when thou have stayed three days, thou shall go down quickly, and come to the place where thou hid thyself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, behold, I will send the lad, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them, and come, for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as LORD lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee, go thy way, for LORD has sent thee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And concerning the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, LORD is between thee and me forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall, and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless Saul spoke nothing that day, for he thought, Something has befallen him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, [which was] the second [day], that David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has the son of Jesse not come in to the food, neither yesterday, nor today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother, he has commanded me. And now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brothers. Therefore he has</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do I not know that thou have chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, thou shall not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? What has he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him. By this Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David because his father had done him shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to his lad, Run, now find the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the lad knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. And they kissed each other, and wept one with another until David surpassed [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, inasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of LORD, saying, LORD shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, forever. And he arose and departed, and Jonathan went i</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
