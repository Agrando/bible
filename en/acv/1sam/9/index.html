And there was not among the sons of Israel a man better looking than he. From his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. And he passed through the land of the B</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says comes surely to pass. Now let us go there, perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey on which we go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What have we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer, for he who is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Saul said to his servant, Well said. Come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they answered them, and said, He is. Behold, [he is] before thee. Make haste now, for he has come today into the city, for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As soon as ye have come into the city, ye shall straightaway find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice, [and] afterwards those who are bidden e</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they went up to the city. [And] as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now LORD had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. And he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon my pe</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Samuel saw Saul, LORD said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to thee! This man shall have authority over my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for ye shall eat with me today. And in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for thy donkeys that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them, for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then speak thou to me according to this manner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chief place among those who were bidden, who were about thirty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before thee and eat, because it has been kept for thee to the appointed time, for I</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they came down from the high place into the city, he conversed with Saul upon the housetop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arose early. And it came to pass about the dawning of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
