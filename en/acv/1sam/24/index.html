Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which LORD said to thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shall do to him as it shall seem good to thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to his men, LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, LORD's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, since he is LORD's anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David restrained his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Saul, Why do thou hearken to men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks thy hurt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that LORD had delivered thee today into my hand in the cave. And some bade me kill thee, but [I] spared thee. And I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord, for he is LORD's anoi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand, for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not. Know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>LORD judge between me and thee, and LORD avenge me of thee, but my hand shall not be upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness, but my hand shall not be upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom do thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>LORD therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to David, Thou are more righteous than I, for thou have rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to thee evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And thou have declared this day how that thou have dealt well with me, inasmuch as when LORD had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killed me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away well? Therefore LORD reward thee good for that which thou have done to me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, behold, I know that thou shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Swear now therefore to me by LORD, that thou will not cut off my seed after me, and that thou will not destroy my name out of my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men got up to the stronghold.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
