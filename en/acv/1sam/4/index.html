Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has LORD smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of LORD out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out o</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of LORD of hosts, who sits [above] the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when the ark of the covenant of LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What is the meaning of the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of LORD came into the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing heretofore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be strong, and strengthen yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Conduct yourselves like men, and fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent. And there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with dirt upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What does the noise of this tumult mean? And the man hastened, and came and told Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he said, How did the matter go, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he who brought the news answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. And thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli] fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate. And his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty year</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth, fo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Fear not, for thou have brought forth a son. But she did not answer, neither did she regard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she said, The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
