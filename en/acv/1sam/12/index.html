And I am old and gray headed, and, behold, my sons are with you. And I have walked before you from my youth to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Here I am. Witness against me before LORD, and before his anointed: Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or of whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with i</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said, Thou have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have thou taken anything of any man's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found anything in my hand. And they said, He is witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Samuel said to the people, It is LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before LORD concerning all the righteous acts of LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to LORD, then LORD sent Moses and Aaron who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they forgot LORD their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they cried to LORD, and said, We have sinned because we have forsaken LORD, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us, when LORD your God was your king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for. And, behold, LORD has set a king over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If ye will fear LORD, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of LORD, then both ye and also the king who reigns over you shall be followers of LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if ye will not hearken to the voice of LORD, but rebel against the commandment of LORD, then the hand of LORD will be against you as it was against your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which LORD will do before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call to LORD that he may send thunder and rain, and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of LORD in asking a king for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Samuel called to LORD, and LORD sent thunder and rain that day. And all the people greatly feared LORD and Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to LORD thy God that we not die, for we have added to all our sins [this] evil, to ask a king for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samuel said to the people, Fear not. Ye have indeed done all this evil, yet turn not aside from following LORD, but serve LORD with all your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And turn ye not aside after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it has pleased LORD to make you a people to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against LORD in ceasing to pray for you. But I will instruct you in the good and the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only fear LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart, for consider what great things he has done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
