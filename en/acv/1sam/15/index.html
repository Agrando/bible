Now therefore hearken thou to the voice of the words of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thus says LORD of hosts, I have remembered that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way when he came up out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them, for ye showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou go to Shur, that is before Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. But everything that was vile and refuse, that they dest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the word of LORD came to Samuel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I regret that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And Samuel was angry, and he cried out to LORD all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set up for him a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul. And Saul said to him, Blessed be thou of LORD. I have performed the commandment of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, What then means this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to LORD thy God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said to Saul, Stop, and I will tell thee what LORD has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, Though thou were little in thine own sight, were thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And LORD anointed thee king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then did thou not obey the voice of LORD, but did fly upon the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of LORD, and have gone the way which LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to LORD thy God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said, Has LORD as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou have rejected the word of LORD, he has also rejected thee from being king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of LORD, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me that I may worship LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee, for thou have rejected the word of LORD, and LORD has rejected thee from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said to him, LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and has given it to a neighbor of thine, who is better than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent, for he is not a man that he should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, I have sinned. Yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned again after Saul, and Saul worshipped LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Samuel said, Bring ye here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before LORD in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death, for Samuel mourned for Saul, and LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
