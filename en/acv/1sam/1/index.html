And his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, and Ephraimite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to LORD, were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but to Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her rival provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And [as] he did so year by year when she went up to the house of LORD, so she provoked her. Therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do thou weep? And why do thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to LORD, and wept much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou will indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but will give to thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to LORD all t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before LORD, that Eli noticed her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said to her, How long will thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Count not thy handmaid for an iniquitous woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou have asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more [sad].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and LORD remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when the time came about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son. And she called his name Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, [Not] until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before LORD, and abide there forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems good to thee. Remain until thou have weaned him, only LORD establish his word. So the woman remained and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of LORD in Shiloh, and the child was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they killed the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by thee here, praying to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I prayed for this child, and LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore also I have granted him to LORD; as long as he lives he is granted to LORD. And he worshipped LORD there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
