Show us with what we shall sent it to its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return for him a trespass-offering. Then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then they said, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords of the Philistines, for one plague was on you all, an</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land. And ye shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Why then do ye harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore take and prepare for you a new cart, and two milk cows on which there has come no yoke. And tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And take the ark of LORD, and lay it upon the cart. And put the jewels of gold, which ye return to him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side of it, and send it away, that it may go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And watch. If it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he has done to us this great evil, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they put the ark of LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the cows took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. And the lords of the Philistines went behind them to the border</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And those of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there where there was a great stone. And they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for a burnt-offering to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Levites took down the ark of LORD, and the coffer that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same d</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering to LORD: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone on which they set down the ark of LORD, [which</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of LORD. He smote of the people fifty thousand and seventy men. And the people mourned, because LORD had smitten the people with a great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before LORD, this holy God?
