They did not kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire. And their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters. But David strengthened himself in LORD his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought there the ephod to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David inquired of LORD, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue, for thou shall surely overtake [them], and shall without fail recover [all].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread. And he ate, and they gave him water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him, for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to him, To whom do thou belong? And from where are thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite. And my master left me because three days ago I fell sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongs to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said to him, Will thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. And there escaped not a man of them, except four hundred young men who rode upon camels and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them; David brought back all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before those [other] cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor. And they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. And when D</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows of those who went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered except to every man his wife and his childr</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then David said, Ye shall not do so, my brothers, with that which LORD has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And who will hearken to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle so shall his share be who remains by the baggage; they shall share alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when David came to Ziklag, he sent from the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan, and to those who were in Athach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to frequent.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
