My horn is exalted in LORD. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There is none holy as LORD, for there is none besides thee, neither is there any rock like our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Talk no more so very proudly. Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth, for LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and those who stumbled are girded with strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those who were full have hired out themselves for bread, and those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]. Yea, the barren has borne seven, and she who has many sons languishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>LORD kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>LORD makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, he also lifts up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He raises up the poor out of the dust, he lifts up the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with rulers, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are LORD's, and he has set the world upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness, for by strength no man shall prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those who strive with LORD shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in heaven. LORD will judge the ends of the earth, and he will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house, and the child ministered to LORD before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot. All that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took with it. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not have boiled flesh from thee, but raw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desires, then he would say, No, but thou shall give it to me now, and if not, I will take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sin of the young men was very great before LORD, for the men despised the offering of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Samuel ministered before LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, LORD give thee seed by this woman for the petition which was asked of LORD. And they went to their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Eli was very old. And he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Why do ye such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear. Ye make LORD's people to transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one man sins against another, God shall judge him, but if a man sins against LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they did not hearken to the voice of their father, because LORD intended to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with LORD, and also with men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says LORD, Did I reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? And did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings of the sons of Israel made by fire</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why do ye kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honor thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore LORD, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me forever, but now LORD says, Be it far from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And thou shall see an enemy [in my] habitation, in all that I shall give Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the man of thine, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be] to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart. And all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this shall be the sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: In one day they shall die, both of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will raise up for me a faithful priest who shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build for him a sure house, and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices that I may eat a morse</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
