And when he had reigned two years over Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Saul chose for him three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash, and on the mount of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin, and the rest of the people he sent every man to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel: thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude. And they came up, and encamped in Michmash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead, but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed], but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Saul said, Bring here the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came, and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said, What have thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>therefore I said, Now the Philistines will come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of LORD. I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou have done foolishly. Thou have not kept the commandment of LORD thy God, which he commanded thee. For now LORD would have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but now thy kingdom shall not continue. LORD has sought for him a man after his own heart, and LORD has appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou have not kept that which LORD commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose, and got up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and another company turned the way to Beth-horon, and another company turned the way of the border that looks down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make for them swords or spears,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan. But with Saul and with Jonathan his son there was found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
