And Achish said to David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shall go out with me in the army, thou and thy men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shall know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I will make thee my chief bodyguard forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Saul inquired of LORD, LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said to his servants, Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at En-dor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night, and he said, Divine to me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the woman said to him, Behold, thou know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. Why then do thou lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul swore to her by LORD, saying, As LORD lives, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have thou deceived me? For thou are Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king said to her, Be not afraid, for what do thou see? And the woman said to Saul, I see gods coming up out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up, and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am greatly distressed, for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, no</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samuel said, Why then do thou ask of me, since LORD departed from thee, and has become thine adversary?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And LORD has done to thee, as he spoke by me. And LORD has rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because thou obeyed not the voice of LORD, and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore LORD has done this thing to thee this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover LORD will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow thou and thy sons shall be with me. LORD will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel, and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy handmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words which thou spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee, and eat, that thou may have strength when thou go on thy way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him, and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the ground, and sat upon the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman had a fatted calf in the house. And she hastened, and killed it, and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
