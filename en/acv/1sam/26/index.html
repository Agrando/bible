But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul definitely came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. And Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David and Abishai came to the people by night. And, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the people lay round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day. Now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not, for who can put forth his hand against LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David said, As LORD lives, LORD will smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down into battle and perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>LORD forbid that I should put forth my hand against LORD's anointed. But now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head, and they got away. And no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from LORD was fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off, a great space being between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David cried out to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are thou that cries to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said to Abner, Are not thou a [valiant] man? And who is like to thee in Israel? Why then have thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? For there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This thing is not good that thou have done. As LORD lives, ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept watch over your lord, LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be LORD who has stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering, but if it be the sons of men, cursed be they before LORD. For they have d</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when [a man] hunts a partridge in the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Saul said, I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do thee harm because my life was precious in thine eyes this day. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! Let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And LORD will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness, inasmuch as LORD delivered thee into my hand today, and I would not put forth my hand against LORD's anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David. Thou shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
