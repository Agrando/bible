I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the blood shall be to you for a sign upon the houses where ye are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this day shall be to you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to LORD; throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread, even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation, no manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And ye shall observe the [feast of] unleavened bread, for in this selfsame day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore ye shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one who is born in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ye shall eat nothing leavened, in all your habitations ye shall eat unleavened bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take to you lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin, and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the mo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, LORD will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it shall come to pass, when ye have come to the land which LORD will give you, according as he has promised, that ye shall keep this service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall come to pass, when your sons shall say to you, What do ye mean by this service?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of LORD's Passover, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Israel went and did so, as LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass at midnight, that LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the first-born of cattl</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the sons of Israel, and go, serve LORD, as ye have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone, and bless me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, We are all dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses, and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a mixed multitude also went up with them, and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now the time that the sons of Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan (LXX) was four hundred and thirty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the armies of LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It is a night to be much observed to LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of LORD, to be much observed of all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover. There shall no foreigner eat of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but every man's servant who is bought for money, when thou have circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In one house it shall be eaten. Thou shall not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house, neither shall ye break a bone of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the Passover to LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it, and he shall be as one who is born in the land, but no uncircumcised man sha</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>One law shall be to him who is home-born, and to the stranger who sojourns among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Thus did all the sons of Israel, as LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass the selfsame day, that LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
