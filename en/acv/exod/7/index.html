And I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I am LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the sons of Israel from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses and Aaron did so, as LORD commanded them, so they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a wonder for you, then thou shall say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh.
