For as for this Moses, the man that brought</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf. And they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Aaron saw [this], he built an altar before it. And Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings. And the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to revel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, Go, get thee down. For thy people, that thou brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made for them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may grow hot against them, and that I may consume them. And I will make of thee a great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses besought LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does thy wrath grow hot against thy people, whom thou have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, He brought them forth for evil, to kill them on the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and relent of this evil against thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swore by thine own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven. And all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And LORD relented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, It is not the voice of those who shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome, but the noise of those who sing do I hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing. And Moses' anger grew hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the sons of Israel drink of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to thee, that thou have brought a great sin upon them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord grow hot. Thou know the people, that they are [set] on evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they said to me, Make gods for us, which shall go before us. For as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is on LORD's side, [come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, Thus says LORD, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to LORD, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to LORD, perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses returned to LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made gods of gold for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet now, if thou will forgive their sin--, and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And now go, lead the people to [the place] of which I have spoken to thee. Behold, my [heavenly] agent shall go before thee. Nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And LORD smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
