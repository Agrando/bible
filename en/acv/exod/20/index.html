Thou shall not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for in six days LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore LORD blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which LORD thy God gives thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shall not murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shall not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou shall not steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shall not bear FALSE witness against thy neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's house.
