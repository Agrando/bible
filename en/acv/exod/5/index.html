I do not know LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king of Egypt said to them, Therefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? Get you to your burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as formerly. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the number of the bricks, which they made formerly, ye shall lay upon them. Ye shall not diminish any of it. For they are idle, therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor in it, and let them not regard lying words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it, for none of your work shall be diminished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfill your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and today, in making brick as formerly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do thou deal thus with thy servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick. And, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault it in thine own people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle. Therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Go therefore now, and work, for there shall no straw be given you, yet ye shall deliver the number of bricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were in affliction, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks, [your] daily tasks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they said to them, LORD look upon you, and judge, because ye have made our fragrance to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses returned to LORD, and said, LORD, why have thou dealt ill with this people? Why is it that thou have sent me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has dealt ill with this people, neither have thou delivered thy people at all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
