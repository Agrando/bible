And LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus thou shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the sons of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be my own possession from among all peoples, for all the earth is mine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shall speak to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which LORD commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people answered together, and said, All that LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee forever. And Moses told the words of the people to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and be ready for the third day, for the third day LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye not go up onto the mount, or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through, whether it be beast or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people, and they washed their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Come not near a woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of an exceedingly loud trumpet. And all the people who were in the camp trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the lower part of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because LORD descended upon it in fire, and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace. And the whole mount quaked greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the voice of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And LORD came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount. And LORD called Moses to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And LORD said to Moses, Go down, command the people, lest they break through to LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let the priests also, who come near to LORD, sanctify themselves, lest LORD break forth upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said to LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai, for thou commanded us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And LORD said to him, Go, get thee down. And thou shall come up, thou, and Aaron with thee, but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
