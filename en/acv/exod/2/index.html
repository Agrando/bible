And when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch. And she put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked along by the riverside. And she saw the ark among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she opened it, and saw the child, and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a nurse for thee from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together. And he said to him who did the wrong, Why do thou smite thy neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Do thou think to kill me, as thou killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye have come so soon today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
