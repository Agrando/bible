And all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which LORD has spoken will we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses wrote all the words of LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar below the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people.
