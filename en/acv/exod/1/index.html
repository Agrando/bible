And Joseph was in Egypt already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty, and the land was filled with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Come, let us deal craftily with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when war happens, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve with rigor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, with which they made them serve with rigor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him, but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women, for they are lively, and are delivered before the midwife comes to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Pharaoh ordered all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
