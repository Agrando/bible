Let my people go, that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into thy border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no man is able to see the ground. And they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day.

Do thou not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, serve LORD your God, but who are those who shall go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go, for we must hold a feast to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, So be LORD with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones.
