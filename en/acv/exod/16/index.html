And all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the sons of Israel said to them, Would that we had died by the hand of LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full, for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this who</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then LORD said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of LORD, for he hears your murmurings against LORD. And what are we, that ye murmur against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said, [This shall be] when LORD shall give you flesh to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning, for that LORD hears your murmurings which ye murmur against him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not a</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before LORD, for he has heard your murmurings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of LORD appeared in the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread. And ye shall know that I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass at evening, that the quails came up, and covered the camp. And in the morning the dew lay round about the camp,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoarfrost on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which LORD has given you to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the thing which LORD has commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating, an omer a head. According to the number of your persons, ye shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Notwithstanding they did not hearken to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul, and Moses was angry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating. And when the sun grew hot, it melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, This is that which LORD has spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to LORD. Bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil, and all that remains over lay up for you to be kept until t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade, and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to LORD. Today ye shall not find it in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six days ye shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath, there shall be none in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And LORD said to Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See, because LORD has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Abide ye every man in his place. Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna. And it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers with honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses said, This is the thing which LORD has commanded. Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egy</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and lay it up before LORD, to be kept throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
