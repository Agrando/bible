And in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is on it, and all the furniture of the tent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded thee they shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Speak thou also to the sons of Israel, saying, Truly ye shall keep my Sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am LORD who sanctifies you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death, for whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is a sign between me and the sons of Israel forever. For in six days LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
