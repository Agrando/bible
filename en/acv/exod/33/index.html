For I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned, and no man put his ornaments on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And LORD said to Moses, Say to the sons of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people. If I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee. Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, afar off from the camp, and he called it, The tent of meeting.
