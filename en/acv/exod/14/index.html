Ye shall encamp opposite it by the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them, and I will get for me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, and the Egyptians shall know that I am LORD. And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled. And the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel, for the sons of Israel went out with a high hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they were very afraid. And the sons of Israel cried out to LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not. Stand still, and see the salvation of LORD, which he will work for you today, for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>LORD will fight for you, and ye shall keep silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And LORD said to Moses, Why do thou cry to me? Speak to the sons of Israel, that they go forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them, and I will get for me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I am LORD, when I have gotten for me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the agent of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And the cloud and the darkness was there, yet it gave light by night. And the one did not come near the other all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and LORD caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass in the morning watch, that LORD looked forth upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and troubled the army of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them with difficulty, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel, for LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared, and the Egyptians fled against it, and LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh who went in after them into the sea, there remained not so much as one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the sons of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw the great work which LORD did upon the Egyptians. And the people feared LORD, and they believed in LORD, and in his servant Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
