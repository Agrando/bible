Yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them. Suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because I knew that thou are obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>therefore I have declared it to thee from of old. Before it came to pass I showed it to thee, lest thou should say, My idol has done them. And my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou have heard it, behold all this, and ye, will ye not declare it? I have shown thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not from of old. And thou have not heard them before this day, lest thou should say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, thou heard not. Yea, thou knew not. Yea, from of old thine ear was not opened. For I knew that thou dealt very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For my name's sake I will defer my anger, and for my praise I will refrain for thee, that I not cut thee off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver. I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my own sake, for my own sake, I will do it. For how should [my name] be profaned? And I not will give my glory to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he. I am the first. I also am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens. When I call to them, they stand up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear: Who among them has declared these things? He whom LORD loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm, the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have spoken, yea, I have called him. I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come ye near to me, hear ye this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret. From the time that it was, there I am. And now lord LORD and his Spirit has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus says LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am LORD thy God, who teaches thee to profit, who leads thee by the way that thou should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that thou had hearkened to my commandments! Then thy peace would have been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains of it. His name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go ye forth from Babylon. Flee ye from the Chaldeans. With a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth. Say ye, LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they did not thirst when he led them through the deserts. He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them. He also split the rock, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, says LORD, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
