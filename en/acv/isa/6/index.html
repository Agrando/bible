Each one had six wings, with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is LORD of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with vapor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I said, Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen the King, LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this has touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I heard the voice of LORD, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, I am here, send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but do not understand, and see ye indeed, but do not perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I said, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and LORD has removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up. As a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled, so the holy seed is the stock of it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
