Hide the outcasts. Do not betray the fugitive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let my outcasts dwell with thee. As for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors are consumed out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a throne shall be established in loving kindness, and he shall sit on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud, even of his arrogance, and his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore Moab shall wail for Moab, everyone shall wail. Ye shall mourn for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth, utterly stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the fields of Heshbon languish, [and] the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches of it, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad.

And in the vineyards there shall be no singing nor joyful noise. No treader shall tread out wine in the presses. I have made the [vintage] shout to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-heres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself upon the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is the word that LORD spoke concerning Moab in time past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now LORD has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude.
