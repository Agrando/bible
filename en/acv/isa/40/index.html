And the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places smooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the glory of LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. For the mouth of LORD has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness of it is as the flower of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withers, the flower fades, because the breath of LORD blows upon it. Surely the people is grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God shall stand forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O thou who tell good news to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain. O thou who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength. Lift it up, be not afraid, say to the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, lord LORD will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He will feed his flock like a shepherd. He will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, [and] will gently lead those who have their young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has has known the mind (LXX/NT) of LORD, or being his counselor has taught him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom did he take counsel. And who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice. And taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance. Behold, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts of it sufficient for a burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the nations are as nothing before him. They are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will ye liken God? Or what likeness will ye compare to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The image, a workman has cast [it], and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts [for it] silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who is too impoverished for [such] an oblation chooses a tree that will not rot. He seeks for him a skilful workman to set up a graven image that shall not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have ye not known? Have yet not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[It is] he who sits above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers, who stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who brings rulers to nothing, who makes the judges of the earth as vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yea, they have not been planted. Yea, they have not been sown. Yea, their stock has not taken root in the earth. Moreover he blows upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal [to him]? says the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these, who brings out their host by number. He calls them all by name, by the greatness of his might. And because he is strong in power, not one is lacking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why do thou say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from LORD. And the justice [due] to me is passed away from my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Have thou not known? Have thou not heard? The everlasting God, LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not, nor is weary. There is no searching of his understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He gives power to the faint. And to him who has no might he increases strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But those who wait for LORD shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run, and not be weary. They shall walk, and not faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
