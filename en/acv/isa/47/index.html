Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For thou shall no more be called tender and delicate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Take the millstones, and grind meal. Remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Our Redeemer, LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans, for thou shall no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I was angry with my people. I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into thy hand. Thou showed them no mercy. Upon the aged thou have laid thy yoke very heavily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou said, I shall be mistress forever, so that thou did not lay these things to thy heart, nor remembered the latter end of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore hear this, thou who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me. I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day: the loss of sons, and widowhood. In their full measure they shall come upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For thou have trusted in thy wickedness. Thou have said, None sees me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it has perverted thee. And thou have said in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore evil shall come upon thee. Thou shall not know the dawning of it. And mischief shall fall upon thee. Thou shall not be able to put it away. And desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou have labored from thy youth, if so be thou shall be able to profit, if so be thou may prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou are wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, they shall be as stubble. The fire shall burn them. They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame. It shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus shall be the things to thee, in which thou have labored. Those who have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander each one to his quarter. There shall be none to save thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
