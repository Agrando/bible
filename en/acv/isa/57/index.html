And merciful men are taken away; none considering that the righteous man is taken away from the evil [to come].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He enters into peace. They rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But draw near here, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Against whom do ye sport yourselves, against whom ye make a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? Are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>ye who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree, who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is thy portion. They, they are thy lot, even to them thou have poured a drink-offering; thou have offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Upon a high and lofty mountain thou have set thy bed. Thou also went up there to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And behind the doors and the posts thou have set up thy memorial. For thou have uncovered [thyself] to another than me, and have gone up. Thou have enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them. Thou loved their bed where th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou went to the king with oil, and increased thy perfumes, and sent thine ambassadors far off, and debased thyself even to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou were wearied with the length of thy way, yet thou did not say, It is in vain. Thou found a quickening of thy strength, therefore thou were not faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And of whom have thou been afraid and in fear, that thou lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? Have I not held my peace even of long time, and thou do not fear me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will declare thy righteousness. And as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When thou cry, let those whom thou have gathered deliver thee. But the wind shall take them; a breath shall carry them all away. But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way. Take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, also with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart o</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry, for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and smote him. I hid [my face] and was angry, and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I create the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near, says LORD, and I will heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked are like the troubled sea, for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
