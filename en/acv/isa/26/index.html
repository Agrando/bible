He will appoint salvation for walls and bulwarks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps faith may enter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou will keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee], because he trusts in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Trust ye in LORD forever, for in LORD, [even] LORD, is an everlasting rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he has brought down those who dwell on high. The lofty city, he lays it low. He lays it low even to the ground. He brings it even to the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The way of the just is uprightness. Thou who are upright directs the path of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, we have waited for thee, to thy name. Even to thy memorial, is the desire of our soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With my soul I have desired thee in the night. Yea, with my spirit within me I will seek thee earnestly. For when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let favor be shown to a wicked man, yet he will not learn righteousness. In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>LORD, thy hand is lifted up, yet they do not see. But they shall see [thy] zeal for the people, and be put to shame. Yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>LORD, thou will ordain peace for us, for thou have also wrought all our works for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O LORD our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us, but by thee only we will make mention of thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>[Being] dead, they shall not live. [Being] deceased, they shall not rise. Therefore thou have visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou have increased the nation, O LORD, thou have increased the nation. Thou are glorified. Thou have enlarged all the borders of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>LORD, in trouble they have visited thee, they poured out a prayer [when] thy chastening was upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs, so we have been before thee, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We have been with child. We have been in pain. We have as it were brought forth wind. We have not wrought any deliverance in the earth, nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy dead shall live. My dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye who dwell in the dust, for thy dew is [as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors around thee. Hide thyself for a little moment until the indignation be passed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For, behold, LORD comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
