I will exalt thee. I will praise thy name. For thou have done wonderful things, [even] counsels of old, in faithfulness [and] truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For thou have made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It shall never be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore a strong people shall glorify thee, a city of oppressive nations shall fear thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thou have been a stronghold to a poor man, a stronghold to a needy man in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the oppressors is as a storm against the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As the heat in a dry place thou will bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the oppressors shall be brought low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in this mountain LORD of hosts will make to all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the dregs, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the dregs well refined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He will swallowed up death in victory, and lord LORD will wipe away tears from off all faces. And he will take away the reproach of his people from off all the earth. For LORD has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God. We have waited for him, and he will save us. This is LORD. We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the hand of LORD will rest on this mountain. And Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of it as he who swims spreads forth [his hands] to swim. But [LORD] will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the high fortress of thy walls he has brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
