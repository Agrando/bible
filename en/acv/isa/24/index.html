The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The earth also is polluted under the inhabitants of it, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell in it are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted do sigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The mirth of tambourine ceases. The noise of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall not drink wine with a song. Strong drink shall be bitter to those who drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The waste city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Desolation is left in the city, and the gate is smitten with destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These shall lift up their voice. They shall shout. For the majesty of LORD they cry aloud from the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore glorify ye LORD in the east, even the name of LORD, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From the outermost part of the earth we have heard songs. Glory to the righteous. But I said, I pine away, I pine away. Woe is me! The treacherous have dealt treacherously, yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall come to pass, that he who flees from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit, and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare. For the windows on high are opened, and the foundations o</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall sway to and fro like a hammock. And the transgression of it shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that LORD will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison. And after many days they shall be visited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, for LORD of hosts will reign in mount Zion and in Jerusalem.
