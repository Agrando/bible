He devises wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaks right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But a noble man devises noble things, and in noble things he shall continue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Rise up, ye women who are at ease. Hear my voice, ye careless daughters. Give ear to my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For ye shall be troubled days beyond a year, ye careless women. For the vintage shall fail; the ingathering shall not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Tremble, ye women who are at ease. Be troubled, ye careless ones. Strip you, and make you bare, and gird [sackcloth] upon your loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall beat upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thorns and briers shall come up on the land of my people, yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the palace shall be forsaken. The populous city shall be deserted. The hill and the watch-tower shall be for dens forever, a joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But it shall hail in the downfall of the forest, and the city shall be utterly laid low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Blessed are ye who sow beside all waters, who send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
