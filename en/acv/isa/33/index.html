When thou have ceased to destroy, thou shall be destroyed, and when thou have made an end of dealing trea</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>O LORD, be gracious to us, we have waited for thee. Be thou our arm every morning, also our salvation in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>At the noise of the tumult the peoples have fled. At the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathers. As locusts leap, men shall leap upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>LORD is exalted, for he dwells on high. He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of LORD is thy treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, their valiant ones cry outside. The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The highways lay waste. The wayfaring man ceases. [The enemy] has broken the covenant. He has despised the cities. He does not regard man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The land mourns and languishes. Lebanon is confounded and withers away. Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their leaves].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now I will arise, says LORD. Now I will lift up myself. Now I will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ye shall conceive chaff. Ye shall bring forth stubble. Your breath is a fire that shall devour you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down that are burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hear, ye who are far off, what I have done, and ye who are near, acknowledge my might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the profane. Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly. He who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands from taking a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall dwell on high. His place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks. His bread shall be given. His waters shall be sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty. They shall behold a land that reaches afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thy heart shall muse on the terror. Where is he who counted? Where is he who weighed [the tribute]? Where is he who counted the towers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou shall not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou cannot comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou cannot understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities. Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed. The stakes of which shall never be plucked up, nor shall any of the cords of it be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But LORD will be with us there in majesty. A place of broad rivers and streams, in which shall go no galley with oars, nor shall a gallant ship pass thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For LORD is our judge. LORD is our lawgiver. LORD is our king, he will save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thy tacklings are loosed. They could not strengthen the foot of their mast. They could not spread the sail. Then the prey of a great spoil was divided. The lame took the prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick. The people who dwell in it shall be forgiven their iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
