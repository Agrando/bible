Your lips have spoken lies. Your tongue mutters wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>No man sues in righteousness, and no man pleads in truth. They trust in vanity, and speak lies. They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web. He who eats of their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Their webs shall not become garments, nor shall they cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity. Desolation and destruction are in their paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their goings. They have made them crooked paths. Whoever goes in it does not know peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore justice is far from us, nor does righteousness overtake us. We look for light, but, behold, darkness, for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We grope for the wall like the blind. Yea, we grope as those who have no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the twilight. [We are] as dead men in desolate places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We all roar like bears, and moan greatly like doves. We look for justice, but there is none, for salvation, but it is far off from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>transgressing and denying LORD, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off. For truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yea, truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him. And his righteousness, it upheld him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head. And he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies. He will repay recompense to the islands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they shall fear the name of LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. For he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of LORD drives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he who redeems will come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says LORD: My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
