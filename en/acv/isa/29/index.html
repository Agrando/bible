Add ye year to year. Let the feasts come round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then I will distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation, and she shall be to me as Ariel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops. And I will raise siege works against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And thou shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground. And thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be as of he who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground. And thy speech shall whisper out of the d</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passes away. Yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She shall be visited by LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be as when a hungry man dreams, and, behold, he eats. But he awakes, and his soul is empty. Or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, behold, he drinks. But he awakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite. S</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Tarry ye and wonder, take your pleasure and be blind. They are drunken, but not with wine. They stagger, but not with strong drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For LORD has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes. The prophets, and your heads, the seers, he has covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all vision has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to a man who is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I cannot, for it is sealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I am not learned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And LORD said, Inasmuch as this people draw near [me] with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but have removed their heart far from me, but in vain they worship me (LXX/NT), {teaching the commandments and doctrines of men</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder.

Shall the potter be esteemed as clay, that the thing made should say of him who made it, He did not make me, or the thing formed say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The meek also shall increase their joy in LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases.
