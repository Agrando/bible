Then LORD said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And LORD spoke to me yet again, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Inasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>now therefore, behold, LORD brings up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and it shall sweep onward into Judah. It shall overflow and pass through; it shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces. And give ear, all ye of far countries. Gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces. Gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nothing. Speak the word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all of which this people shall say, A conspiracy, nor fear ye their fear, nor be in dread [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>LORD of hosts, him ye shall sanctify, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he shall be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a net and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And many shall stumble on it, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Bind thou up the testimony. Seal the law among my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will wait for LORD, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will be a man who has trusted (LXX/NT) in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, I and the children whom LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from LORD of hosts, who dwells in mount Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they shall say to you, Seek for those who have familiar spirits and for the wizards, who chirp and who mutter, should not a people seek for their God? On behalf of the living [seek] to the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[Seek] to the law and to the testimony! If they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they shall pass through it, greatly distressed and hungry. And it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they shall look to the earth, and, behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and into thick darkness [to be] driven away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
