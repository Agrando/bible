And the sojourner shall join himself with them, and they shall cling to the house of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the peoples shall take them, and bring them to their place. And the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of LORD for servants and for handmaids. And they shall take them captive whose captives they were, and they shal</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it shall come to pass in the day that LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy trouble, and from the hard service in which thou were made to serve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that thou shall take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The whole earth is at rest, [and] is quiet. They break forth into singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, [and] the cedars of Lebanon, [saying], Since thou are laid low, no hewer has come up against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Sheol from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming. It stirs up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth. It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall all answer and say to thee, Have thou also become weak as we? Have thou become like us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thy pomp is brought down to Sheol, [and] the noise of thy viols. The worm is spread under thee, and worms cover thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How thou are fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! How thou are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thou said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the outermost parts of the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will make myself like the Most High.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet thou shall be brought down to Sheol, to the utmost parts of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Those who see thee shall gaze at thee. They shall consider thee, [saying], Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>who made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew the cities of it, who did not let loose his prisoners to their home?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, each one in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But thou are cast forth away from thy sepulcher like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit, as a dead body trodden under foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou shall not be joined with them in burial, because thou have destroyed thy land. Thou have slain thy people. The seed of evil-doers shall not be named forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Prepare ye slaughter for his sons for the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up, and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will rise up against them, says LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son's son, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. And I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>LORD of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely, as I have thought, so shall it come to pass, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot upon my mountains.

And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken. For out of the serpent's root shall come forth an adder, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety. And I will kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant shall be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Howl, O gate, cry, O city. Thou are melted away, O Philistia, all of thee. For there comes a smoke out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What then shall [a man] answer the messengers of the nation? That LORD has founded Zion, and in her shall the afflicted of his people take refuge.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
