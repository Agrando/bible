My well-beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he dug it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress in it. And he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought fo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the hedge of it, and it shall be eaten up. I will break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay it waste. It shall not be pruned nor hoed, but there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the vineyard of LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant. And he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression, for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field, till there is no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In my ears [says] LORD of hosts, of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield [but] an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink, who tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the harp and the lute, the tambourine and the pipe, and wine, are [in] their feasts, but they do not regard the work of LORD, nor have they considered the operation of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore my people have gone into captivity for lack of knowledge, and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure. And their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend [into it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the common man is bowed down, and the great man is debased, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but LORD of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the lambs shall feed as in their pasture, and wanderers shall eat the waste places of the fat ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it. And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil, who put darkness for light, and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who justify the wicked for rewards, and take away the justice of the righteous man from him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust, because they have rejected the law of LORD of hosts, an</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore the anger of LORD is kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them. And the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets.

None shall slumber nor sleep, nor shall the belt of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent. Their horses' hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Their roaring shall be like a lioness. They shall roar like young lions. Yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. And if [a man] looks to the land, behold, darkness [and] distress, and the light is darkened in the clouds of it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
