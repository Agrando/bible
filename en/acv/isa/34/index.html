And hearken, ye peoples. Let the earth hear, and the fullness thereof, the world, and all things that come forth from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For LORD has indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host. He has utterly destroyed them. He has delivered them to the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Their slain also shall be cast out. And the stench of their dead bodies shall come up, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll. And all their host shall fade away as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as a fading [leaf] from the fig tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For my sword has drunk its fill in heaven. Behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The sword of LORD is filled with blood. It is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams, for LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the wild oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls. And their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the streams of [Edom] shall be turned into pitch, and the dust of it into brimstone. And the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It shall not be quenched night nor day. The smoke of it shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste. None shall pass through it forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it. And the owl and the raven shall dwell in it. And he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall call the nobles of it to the kingdom, but none shall be there. And all its rulers shall be nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses of it. And it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves. And the wild goat shall cry to his fellow. Yea, the screech owl shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There the dart-snake shall make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade. Yea, there the vultures shall be gathered, each one with her mate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Seek ye out of the book of LORD, and read. No one of these shall be missing. None shall want her mate. For my mouth, it has commanded, and his Spirit, it has gathered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it to them by line. They shall possess it forever. From generation to generation they shall dwell therein.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
