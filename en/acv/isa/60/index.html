But LORD will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lift up thine eyes round about, and see. They all gather themselves together. They come to thee. Thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then thou shall see and be radiant, and thy heart shall thrill and be enlarged, because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to thee. The wealth of the nations shall come to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The multitude of camels shall cover thee. The dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to thee. The rams of Nebaioth shall minister to thee. They shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And foreigners shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister to thee. For in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor I have had mercy on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thy gates also shall be open continually. They shall not be shut day nor night, that men may bring to thee the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish. Yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary. And I will make the place of my feet glorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the sons of those who afflicted thee shall come bending to thee. And all those who despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet. And they shall call thee The city of LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whereas thou have been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shall also suck the milk of the nations, and shall suck the breast of kings. And thou shall know that I, LORD, am thy Savior, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine overseers righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders, but thou shall call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The sun shall no more be thy light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give light to thee, but LORD will be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thy sun shall no more go down, nor shall thy moon withdraw itself, for LORD will be thine everlasting light. And the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thy people also shall all be righteous. They shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation. I, LORD, will hasten it in its time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
