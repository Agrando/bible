I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why are thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him who treads in the wine vat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was no man with me. Yea, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath, and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I looked, and there was none to help. And I wondered that there was none to uphold. Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me. And my wrath, it upheld me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of LORD, [and] the praises of LORD, according to all that LORD has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his merci</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he said, Surely, they are my people, sons that will not deal falsely. So he was their Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the [heavenly] agent of his presence saved them. In his love and in his pity he redeemed them. And he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit. Therefore he was turned to be their enemy, [and] himself fought against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people, [saying], Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put his holy Spirit in the midst of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they stumbled not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As the cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of LORD caused them to rest. So thou led thy people to make thyself a glorious name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory. Where are thy zeal and thy mighty acts? The yearning of thy heart and thy compassions are restrained toward me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thou are our Father, though Abraham knows us not, and Israel does not acknowledge us, thou, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer, from everlasting is thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O LORD, why do thou make us to err from thy ways, and harden our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thy holy people possessed [it] but a little while. Our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We have become as those over whom thou never bore rule, as those who were not called by thy name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
