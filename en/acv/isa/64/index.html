Behold, thou were angry, and we sinned. Therefore we have erred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For we have all become as unclean, and all our righteous acts are as a polluted garment. And we all fade as a leaf.

Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire, and all our pleasant places are laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Will thou restrain thyself for these things, O LORD?
