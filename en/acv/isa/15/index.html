For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nothing. For in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab wails over Nebo, and over Medeba. On all their heads is baldness. Every beard is cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth. On their housetops, and in their broad places, everyone wails, weeping abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Heshbon cries out, and Elealeh. Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud. His soul trembles within him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My heart cries out for Moab. Her nobles [flee] to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishi-yah. For they go up with weeping by the ascent of Luhith. For they raise up a cry of destruction in the way of Horonaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate, for the grass is withered away. The tender grass fails. There is no green thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, they shall carry away over the brook of the willows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the cry has gone round about the borders of Moab, the wailing of it to Eglaim, and the wailing of it to Beer-elim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the waters of Dimon are full of blood. For I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon those of Moab who escape, and upon the remnant of the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
