And thou shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of LORD shall name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thou shall no more be termed Forsaken, nor shall thy land any more be termed Desolate. But thou shall be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah, for LORD delights in thee, and thy land shall be married.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee. And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem. They shall never keep silent day nor night.

And those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go through, go through the gates. Prepare ye the way of the people. Cast up, cast up the highway. Gather out the stones. Lift up an ensign for the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation comes. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of LORD. And thou shall be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
