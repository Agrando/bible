For my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Neither let the foreigner, who has joined himself to LORD, speak, saying, LORD will surely separate me from his people, nor let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says LORD of the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>To them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters. I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Also the foreigners who join themselves to LORD, to minister to him, and to love the name of LORD, to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and holds fast my covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>even them I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar, for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lord LORD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, Yet I will gather to him, besides his own who are gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, [yea], all ye beasts in the forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His watchmen are blind. They are all without knowledge. They are all mute dogs. They cannot bark, dreaming, laying down, loving to slumber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yea, the dogs are greedy; they can never have enough. And these are shepherds who cannot understand. They have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Come ye, [they say], I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink. And tomorrow shall be as this day, great beyond measure.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
