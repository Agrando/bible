Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways. As a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Why have we fasted, [they say], and thou see not? We have afflicted our soul, and thou take no knowledge. Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact from all your laborers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. Ye do not fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is such the fast that I have chosen, the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is it not to deal thy bread to a hungry man, and that thou bring the poor who are cast out to thy house, when thou see a naked man, that thou cover him, and that thou not hide thyself from thine own flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then thy light shall break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily. And thy righteousness shall go before thee. The glory of LORD shall be thy rearward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then thou shall call, and LORD will answer, thou shall cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take the yoke away from the midst of thee, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if thou draw out thy soul to a hungry man, and satisfy an afflicted soul, then thy light shall rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And LORD will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones. And thou shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters fail not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And those who shall be of thee shall build the old waste places. Thou shall raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, [and] the holy of LORD honorable, and shall honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, no</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then thou shall delight thyself in LORD, and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of LORD has spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
