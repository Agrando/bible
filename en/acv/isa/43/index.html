I have called thee by thy name, Thou are mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When thou pass through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee. When thou walk through the fire, thou shall not be burned, nor shall the flame kindle upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I am LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior. I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Since thou have been precious in my sight, [and] honorable, and I have loved thee, therefore I will give men in thy stead, and peoples instead of thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fear not, for I am with thee. I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Keep not back. Bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>everyone who is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bring forth the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled. Who among them can declare this, and show us former things? Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified, or let them hear, and say, It is tru</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ye are my witnesses, says LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he. Before me there was no God formed, nor shall there be after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I, even I, am LORD, and besides me there is no savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have declared, and I have saved, and I have shown, and there was no strange [god] among you. Therefore ye are my witnesses, says LORD, and I am God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, since the day was I am he, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. I will work, and who can hinder it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I am LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says LORD, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lay down together; they shall not rise; they are extinct; they are quenched as a wick):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not remember ye the former things, nor consider the things of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I will do a new thing. Now it shall spring forth. Shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The beasts of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>the people whom I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet thou have not called upon me, O Jacob, but thou have been weary of me, O Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thou have not brought me from thy sheep for burnt-offerings, nor have thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices. But thou have burdened me with thy sins. Thou have wearied me with thine iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I, even I, am he who blots out thy transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember thy sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Put me in remembrance. Let us plead together. Set thou forth [thy case] that thou may be justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I will profane the rulers of the sanctuary, and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
