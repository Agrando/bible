Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. It is revealed to them from the land of Kittim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Be still, ye inhabitants of the coast, thou whom the merchants of Sidon, who pass over the sea, have replenished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And on great waters the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue, and she was the mart of nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the report comes to Egypt, they shall be greatly pained at the report of Tyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pass ye over to Tarshish. Wail, ye inhabitants of the coast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is this your joyous [city], whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her afar off to sojourn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who has purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are rulers, whose traders are the honored of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>LORD of hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pass through thy land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish, there is no restraint any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. LORD has given commandment concerning Canaan, to destroy the strongholds of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Thou shall no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim, even there shall thou have no rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people [once] was not. The Assyrian founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They raised up the palaces of it. [Then] they made it a ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it shall be to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot who has been forgotten. Make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou may be remembered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass after the end of seventy years, that LORD examined Tyre, and she has repented of her gift, that she play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And her merchandise and her pay shall be holiness to LORD. It shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her merchandise shall be for those who dwell before LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
