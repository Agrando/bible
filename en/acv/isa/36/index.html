And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah came forth to him, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this in which thou trust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say, [thy] counsel and strength for the war are but vain words. Now on whom do thou trust that thou have rebelled against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, thou trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if thou say to me, We trust in LORD our God. Is that not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How then can thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And have I now come up without LORD against this land to destroy it? LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. And speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words, [and] not to the men who sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in LORD, saying, LORD will surely deliver us. This city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hearken not to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me, and eat ye everyone of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and drink ye everyone the waters of his own cistern,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, LORD will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word. For the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah came, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
