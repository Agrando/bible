I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One shall say, I am LORD's, and another shall call [himself] by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe with his hand to LORD, and surname [himself] by the name of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus says LORD, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, LORD of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? And let them declare the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Fear ye not, nor be afraid. Have I not declared to thee of old, and shown it? And ye are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? Yea, there is no Rock. I know not any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those who fashion a graven image are all of them vanity. And the things that they delight in shall not profit. And their own witnesses see not, nor know, that they may be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who has fashioned a god, or molded an image that is profitable for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame, and the workmen. They are of men. Let them all be gathered together. Let them stand up. They shall fear. They shall be put to shame together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The smith [makes] an axe, and works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm. Yea, he is hungry, and his strength fails. He drinks no water, and is faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The carpenter stretches out a line. He marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes. And he marks it out with the compasses, and shapes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He hews down cedars for him, and takes the holm tree and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir tree, and the rain nourishes it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then it shall be for a man to burn. And he takes of it, and warms himself. Yea, he kindles it, and bakes bread. Yea, he makes a god, and worships it. He makes it a graven image, and falls down to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He burns part of it in the fire. With part of it he eats flesh. He roasts roast, and is satisfied. Yea, he warms himself, and says, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the residue of it he makes a god, even his graven image. He falls down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me, for thou are my god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They do not know, nor do they consider. For he has shut their eyes, that they cannot see, and their hearts, that they cannot understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And none calls to mind, nor is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire. Yea, I have also baked bread upon the coals of it. I have roasted flesh and eaten it. And shall I make the residue of it</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He feeds on ashes. A deceived heart has turned him aside. And he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for thou are my servant. I have formed thee. Thou are my servant, O Israel, thou shall not be forgotten by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins. Return to me, for I have redeemed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sing, O ye heavens, for LORD has done it. Shout, ye lower parts of the earth. Break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein. For LORD has redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says LORD, thy Redeemer, and he who formed thee from the womb: I am LORD, who makes all things, who stretches forth the heavens alone, who spreads abroad the earth (who is with me?),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad, who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited, and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>who says of Cyrus, [He is] my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure, even saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built, and of the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
