The child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying], Thou have clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>in that day he shall lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer, for in my house is neither bread nor clothing. Ye shall not make me ruler of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because their tongue and their doings are against LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The show of their countenance witnesses against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have done evil to themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say ye of the righteous, that [it is] well, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Woe to the wicked! [It is] ill [with him], for what his hands have done shall be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, those who lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>LORD stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the rulers of it. It is ye who have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of a poor man is in your houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What do ye mean that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? says the Lord, LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>therefore LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and LORD will lay bare their secret parts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day LORD will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the hair nets, and the crescents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the bonnets, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>the rings, and the nose-jewels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness, and instead of a girdle, a rope, and instead of well set hair, baldness, and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth, branding instead of beauty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
