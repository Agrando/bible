I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib, [but] Israel does not know; my people does not consider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, sons who deal corruptly! They have forsaken LORD. They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They have gone away backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes. They have not been closed nor bound up nor soothed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Your land--strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a shed in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Unless LORD of hosts had left to us a seed (LXX/NT), we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of LORD, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says LORD. I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts. And I do not delight in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand--to trample my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain oblations. Incense is an abomination to me. New moon and Sabbath, the calling of assemblies--I cannot bear iniquity and the solemn meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They are a trouble to me. I am weary of bearing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Learn to do good. Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now, and let us reason together, says LORD, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of LORD has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How the faithful city has become a harlot! She who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thy silver has become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thy rulers are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They judge not the fatherless, nor does the cause of the widow come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore says the Lord, LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning. Afterward thou shall be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake LORD shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall be as flax, and his work as a spark. And they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
