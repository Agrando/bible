Therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it on a scroll, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is a rebellious people, lying sons, sons who will not hear the law of LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who say to the seers, Do not see, and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things. Speak to us smooth things. Prophesy deceits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You get out of the way. Turn aside out of the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there shall not be found among the pieces of it a shard with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cis</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus said lord LORD, the Holy One of Israel, Ye shall be saved in returning and rest. Your strength shall be in quietness and in confidence. And ye would not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses. Therefore ye shall flee. And [ye said], We will ride upon the swift. Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One thousand [shall flee] at the threat of one. Ye shall flee at the threat of five, till ye are left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And therefore LORD will wait, that he may be gracious to you. And therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you. For LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. Thou shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry. When he shall hear, he will answer thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And though LORD give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet thy teachers shall not be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold. Thou shall cast them away as an unclean thing. Thou shall say to it, Get thee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he will give the rain for thy seed, with which thou shall sow the ground, and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous.

His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. And a bridle that causes to err [shall be] in the jaws of the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as he who goes with a pipe to come to the mountain of LORD, to the Rock of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And LORD will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the coming down of his arm with the indignation of [his] anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast and tempest and hailstones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For through the voice of LORD the Assyrian shall be dismayed. With his rod he will smite [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And every stroke of the appointed staff, which LORD shall lay upon him, shall be with [the sound of] tambourine and harps. And he will fight with them in battles with the brandishing [of his arm].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For a Topheth is prepared of old, yea, it is made ready for the king. He has made it deep and large. The pile of it is fire and much wood. The breath of LORD kindles it, like a stream of brimstone.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
