As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam. Besiege, O Media, all the sighing of it I have made to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore my loins are filled with anguish. Pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail. I am pained so that I cannot hear. I am dismayed so that I cannot see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink. Rise up, ye rulers, anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus has LORD said to me, Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and when he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he cried out as a lion, O LORD, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and am set in my ward whole nights,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and, behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon. And all the graven images of her gods are broken to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard from LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night. If ye will inquire, inquire ye; turn ye back, come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia ye shall lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>To him who was thirsty they brought water. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus LORD has said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, shall be few. For LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
