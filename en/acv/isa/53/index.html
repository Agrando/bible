And to whom has the arm of LORD been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground. He has no form nor comeliness. And when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He was despised, and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And as him from whom men hide their face he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.
