To whom will ye flee for help? And where will ye leave your glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They shall only bow down under the prisoners, and shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ho, Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath. I will give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However he does not so reason, nor does his heart so think, but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he says, Are not my rulers all of them kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images excelled those of Jerusalem and of Samaria,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore it shall come to pass, that, when LORD has performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding. And I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. And like a valiant man I have brought down those</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the peoples. And like a gathering of eggs that are forsaken, I have gathered all the earth. And there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall the axe boast itself against him who hews with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield those who lift it up, [or] as if a staff should lift up [him who is] not wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore will the Lord, LORD of hosts, send among his fat ones, leanness, and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame, and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. And it shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may write them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him who smote them, but shall lean upon LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A remnant shall return, [even] the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though thy people, Israel, be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall return. A destruction [is] determined, overflowing with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For a full end, and that determined, the Lord, LORD of hosts, will make in the midst of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore thus says the Lord, LORD of hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, though he smites thee with the rod, and lifts up his staff against thee, according to the manner of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be accomplished, and my anger [is] to his destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And LORD of hosts will stir up against him a scourge as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up according to the manner of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he lays up his baggage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cry aloud with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim! Hearken, O Laishah! O thou poor Anathoth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This very day he shall halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, the Lord, LORD of hosts, will lop off the boughs with terror. And the high of stature shall be hewn down, and the lofty shall be brought low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
