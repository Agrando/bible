Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou have multiplied the nation. Thou have increased their joy. They joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou have broken as in the day of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given.
