Break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou who did not travail with child. For more are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married woman, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations. Spare not. Lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For thou shall spread aboard on the right hand and on the left. And thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Fear not, for thou shall not be ashamed. Neither be thou confounded, for thou shall not be put to shame. For thou shall forget the shame of thy youth. And the reproach of thy widowhood thou shall remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thy maker is thy husband. LORD of hosts is his name. And the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer. He shall be called the God of the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For LORD has called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit. Even a wife of youth when she is cast off, says thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a small moment I have forsaken thee, but with great mercies I will gather thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting loving kindness I will have mercy on thee, says LORD thy Redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is [as] the waters of Noah to me. For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with thee, nor rebuke thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed, but my loving kindness shall not depart from thee, nor shall my covenant of peace be removed, says LORD who has mercy on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all thy sons shall be taught of LORD, and great shall be the peace of thy sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shall be established in righteousness. Thou shall be far from oppression, for thou shall not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, they may gather together, but not by me. Whoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work. And I have created the waster to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper. And every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of LORD, and their righteousness which is of me, says LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
