What manner of house will ye build to me, and what place shall be my rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For all these things my hand has made, and all these things came to be, says LORD. But to this man I will look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He who slaughters an ox is as he who kills a man. He who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck. He who offers an oblation, [as] swine's blood. He who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yea, they have chosen t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them. Because when I called, none answered. When I spoke, they did not hear. But they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hear the word of LORD, ye who tremble at his word: Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name's sake, have said, Let LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy. But it is those who shall be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of LORD who renders recompense to his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Before she travailed, she brought forth. Before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says LORD. Shall I who cause to bring forth shut [the womb]? says thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all ye who mourn over her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that ye may nurse and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations, that ye may [get] milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream. And ye shall nurse [thereof]. Ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass. And the hand of LORD shall be known toward his servants, and he will have indignation against his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, behold, LORD will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind, to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For by fire LORD will execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh, and the slain of LORD shall be many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go] to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I [know] their works and their thoughts. [The time] comes, that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come, and shall see my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory, a</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an oblation to LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says LORD, as the sons of Isr</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And of them also I will take for priests [and] for Levites, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me.
