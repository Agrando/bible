Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities ye were sold, and for your transgressions your moth</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make the rivers a wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lord LORD has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary. He awakens morning by morning. He awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Lord LORD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair. I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For lord LORD will help me. Therefore I have not been confounded. Therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He is near who justifies me. Who will content with me? Let us stand up together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, lord LORD will help me. Who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall grow old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is among you that fears LORD, who obeys the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the name of LORD, and rely upon his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all ye who kindle a fire, who gird yourselves about with firebrands, walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This ye shall have from my hand. Ye shall lie down in sorrow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
