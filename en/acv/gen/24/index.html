And LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put thy hand, I pray thee, under my thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will make thee swear by LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou will not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But thou shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I bring thy son again to the land from where thou came?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham said to him, Beware thou that thou not bring my son there again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land, he will send his [heavenly] agent before thee, and</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shall be clear from this my oath. Only thou shall not bring my son there again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master's in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he made the camels to kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou have appointed for th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, before he was done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hurried, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man looked steadfastly on her, keeping silent, to know whether LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and said, Whose daughter are thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the man bowed his head, and worshipped LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, Blessed be LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. And Laban ran out to the man, to the fountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me, that he came to the man. And, behold, he was standing by the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Come in, thou blessed of LORD. Why do thou stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there was set before him food to eat. But he said, I will not eat until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I am Abraham's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And LORD has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great. And he has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old. And has he given to him all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but thou shall go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to me, LORD, before whom I walk, will send his [heavenly] agent with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then thou shall be clear from my oath, when thou come to my kindred. And if they do not give her to thee, thou shall be clear from my oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I came this day to the fountain, and said, O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if thou do now prosper my way which I go,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>behold, I am standing by the fountain of water, and let it come to pass, that the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels, let the same be the woman whom LORD has appointed for my master's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And before I was done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down to the fountain, and drew. And I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And I bowed my head, and worshipped LORD, and blessed LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from LORD; we cannot speak to thee bad or good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as LORD has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us [a few] days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And he said to them, Do not hinder me, since LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they sent Rebekah their sister away, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our sister, be thou [the mother] of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi, for he dwelt in the land of the South.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And she said to the servant, What man is this who walks in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
