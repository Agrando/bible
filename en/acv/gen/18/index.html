And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart. After that ye shall pass on, inasmuch as ye came to your servant. And they said, Do so as thou have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it to the servant. And he hastened to dress it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I will certainly return to thee when the season comes round, and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, [and] well stricken in age. It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have become old shall I have pleasure, my lord also being old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I who am old certainly bear a child?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anything too hard for LORD? At the set time I will return to thee, when the season comes round, and Sarah shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Sarah denied, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And he said, No, but thou did laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of LORD, to do righteousness and justice, to the end that LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoke</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which comes to me. And if not, I will know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham yet stood before LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Abraham drew near, and said, Will thou consume righteous men with wicked men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Perhaps there are fifty righteous men within the city. Will thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous men that are in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay a righteous man with a wicked man, that so the righteous man should be as the wicked man. Far be it from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous men within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Perhaps there shall lack five of the fifty righteous men. Will thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty-five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Perhaps there shall be thirty found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord. Perhaps there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Perhaps ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And LORD went his way as soon as he had left off conversing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
