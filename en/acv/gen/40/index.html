And they continued a season in ward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Why do ye look so sad today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no man who can interpret it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me, I pray you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in the vine were three branches. And it was as though it budded, [and] its blossoms shot forth, [and] the clusters of it brought forth ripe grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Within yet three days Pharaoh shall lift up thy head, and restore thee to thine office. And thou shall give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou was his butler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Within yet three days Pharaoh shall lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree, and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
