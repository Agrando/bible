And he said to him, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take venison for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And make savory food for me, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, that my soul may bless thee before I die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Bring venison for me, and make savory food for me, that I may eat, and bless thee before LORD before my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go now to the flock, and fetch me two good kids of the goats from there. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shall bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My father will perhaps feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his mother said to him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch them for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he came to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am. Who are thou, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau thy firstborn. I have done according as thou bade me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because LORD thy God sent me good speed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jacob went near to Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he did not discern him, because his hands were hairy as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, Are thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate. And he brought wine to him, and he drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that LORD has blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let peoples serve thee, and nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brothers, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be he who curses thee, and blessed be he who blesses thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he also made savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Isaac his father said to him, Who are thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou came, and have blessed him? Yea, he shall be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and has taken away thy blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, Is not he rightly name Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have thou not reserved a blessing for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Esau said to his father, Have thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and of the dew of heaven from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And by thy sword thou shall live, and thou shall serve thy brother. And it shall come to pass, when thou shall break loose, that thou shall shake his yoke from off thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau comforts himself concerning thee, to kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turns away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>until thy brother's anger turns away from thee, and he forgets that which thou have done to him. Then I will send, and fetch thee from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
