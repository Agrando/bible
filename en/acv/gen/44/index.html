And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>[And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men, and when thou overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not this that in which my lord drinks, and how he indeed divines? Ye have done evil in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee out of the land of Canaan. How then would we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom it is found shall be my bondman, and ye shall be blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they hurried, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house. And he was yet there, and they fell before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak, or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is fou</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman, but as for you, get you up in peace to your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant, for thou are even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. And his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou said to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou said to thy servants, Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We cannot go down. If our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down, for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother be with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad's life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>it will come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not [with us], that he will die. And thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I do not bring him to thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide a bondman to my lord instead of the lad, and let the lad go up with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? Lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
