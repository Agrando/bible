And he said to the woman, Yea, has God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For God knows that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate. And she also gave to her husband with her, and h</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they heard the voice of LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And LORD God called to the man, and said to him, Where are thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. And I hid myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Have thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee that thou should not eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said, The woman whom thou gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And LORD God said to the woman, What is this thou have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou have done this, cursed are thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly thou shall go, and dust thou shall eat all the days of thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. He shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy childbearing, in pain thou shall bring forth children. And thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And to Adam he said, Because thou have hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shall not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake. In toil thou shall eat of it all</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Also, thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to thee, and thou shall eat the herb of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the sweat of thy face thou shall eat bread, till thou return to the ground, for out of it thou were taken. For thou are dust, and to dust thou shall return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And LORD God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And LORD God said, Behold, the man has become as one of us--to know good and evil--and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>therefore LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from where he was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he drove out the man.
