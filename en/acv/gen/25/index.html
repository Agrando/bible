And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But to the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred seventy-five years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full [of years], and was gathered to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years. And he gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur which is before Egypt, as thou go toward Assyria. He abode opposite all his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac entreated LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And LORD was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, why do I live? And she went to inquire of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And LORD said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. And the elder shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after that his brother came forth, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel, and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage], for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob said, First sell me thy birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die, and what profit shall the birthright do to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he swore to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
