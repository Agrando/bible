Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and Joseph brought the evil</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made for him a coat of many colors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers. And they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him yet the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright. And, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his brothers said to him, Shall thou indeed reign over us? Or shall thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers. And said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream again. And, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he told it to his father, and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that thou have dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the ear</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Israel said to Joseph, Are not thy brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brothers, and well with the flock, and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, What do thou seek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I am seeking my brothers. Tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said, They are departed from here, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they saw him afar off. And before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come now therefore, and let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits. And we will say, An evil beast has devoured him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood. Cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him, that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they took him, and cast him into the pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they sat down to eat bread. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers hearkened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen, and they drew and lifted Joseph up out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Reuben returned to the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit. And he rent his clothes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not, and I, where shall I go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, We have found this. Know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat. An evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
