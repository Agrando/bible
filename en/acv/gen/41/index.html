And, behold, he stood by the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, well-favored and fat-fleshed, and they fed in the reed grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he slept and dreamed a second time. And, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, fat and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men of it. And Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was no man who could interpret them to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he, we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was a young man with us there, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him. And he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man according to his dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; he restored me to my office, and he hanged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph. And they brought him hastily out of the dungeon, and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no man who can interpret it. And I have heard say of thee, that when thou hear a dream thou can interpret it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed and well-favored, and they fed in the reed grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the lean and ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no man who could declare it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; what God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the seven lean and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind, they shall be seven years of famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and there shall arise after them seven years of famine. And all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the plenty shall not be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it shall be very grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And because the dream was doubled to Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out for a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land not perish through the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Inasmuch as God has shown thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou shall be over my house, and according to thy word all my people shall be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Pharaoh took his signet ring from off his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had, and they cried before him, Bow the knee. And he set him over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, for a wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. The food of the field, which was round about every city, he laid up in the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering, for it was without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And two sons were born to Joseph before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, for, God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the name of the second he called Ephraim, for God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And the famine was over all the face of the earth. And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe on all the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
