And, lo, three flocks of sheep were laying there by it, for they watered the flocks out of that well. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the flocks were gathered there. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jacob said to them, My brothers, where are ye from? And they said, We are of Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Do ye know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, We cannot until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban hi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him, Surely thou are my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou are my brother, should thou therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob loved Rachel, and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou have done to me? Did I not serve with thee for Rachel? Why then have thou beguiled me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shall serve with me yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he also went in to Rachel, and also he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And LORD saw that Leah was regarded inferior, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because LORD has looked upon my affliction, for now my husband will love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Because LORD has heard that I am regarded inferior, he has therefore given me this [son] also. And she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son. And she said, This time I will praise LORD. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
