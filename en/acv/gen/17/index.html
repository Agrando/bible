And God talked with him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shall be the father of a multitude of nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham, for I have made thee the father of a multitude of nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful. And I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojourning, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God said to Abraham, And as for thee, thou shall keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a sign of a covenant between me and you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he who is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations: he who is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who is born in thy house, and he who is bought with thy money, must be circumcised.

And moreover I will give thee a son by her. Yea, I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother of] nations; kings of peoples shall be by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him who is a hundred years old?

Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the selfsame day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
