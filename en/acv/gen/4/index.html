And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought an offering to LORD of the fruit of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but he did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And LORD said to Cain, Why are thou angry? And why has thy countenance fallen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? And if thou do not well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire shall be for thee, and thou shall rule over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, What have thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cries to me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now cursed are thou from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When thou till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength. A fugitive and a wanderer thou shall be on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said to LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, thou have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and I shall be hid from thy face, and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. And it shall come to pass, that whoever finds me shall slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And LORD said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest any who finds him should smite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Cain went out from the presence of LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch. And [Cain] built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took to him two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, truly Lamech seventy-seven fold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For, [she said], God has appointed for me another seed instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
