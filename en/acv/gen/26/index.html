And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And LORD appeared to him, and said, Do not go down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For to thee, and to thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham thy father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these lands, and in thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my order, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife, Lest, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she was fair to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was playing with Rebekah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, she is certainly thy wife, and how did thou say, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said, What is this thou have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou would have brought guiltiness upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abimelech ordered all the people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And LORD blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the man became great, and grew more and more until he became very great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us, for thou are much mightier than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Isaac departed there, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Isaac again dug the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they dug another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he moved from there, and dug another well, and they did not strive for that. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from there to Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of LORD, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaac said to them, Why have ye come to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said, We saw plainly that LORD was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and thee. And let us make a covenant with thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that thou will do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou are now the blessed of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they rose up promptly in the morning, and swore one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they were a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
