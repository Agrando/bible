And he said, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou love, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go yonder, and we will worship, and come again to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So they went both of them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the agent of LORD called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Do not lay thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything to him. For now I know that thou fear God, since thou have not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, behind [him] a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abraham called the name of that place LORD-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of LORD it shall be provided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the agent of LORD called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said, By myself I have sworn, says LORD, because thou have done this thing, and have not withheld thy son, thine only son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou have obeyed my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Abraham returned to his young men. And they rose up and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Uz his first born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
