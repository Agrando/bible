And they took to them wives of all that they chose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And LORD said, My spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he also is flesh. Yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days. And also after that, when the sons of God came to the daughters of men, and they bore sons to them, the same were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground, from man, to beast, to creeping things, and birds of the heavens, for I regret that I have made them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Noah found favor in the eyes of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them, and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Make thee an ark of gopher wood. Thou shall make rooms in the ark, and shall pitch it inside and outside with pitch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is how thou shall make it: The length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shall make a light for the ark, and thou shall finish it to a cubit upward. And thou shall set the door of the ark in the side of it, with lower, second, and third stories thou shall make it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I, behold, I bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I will establish my covenant with thee. And thou shall come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort thou shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee. They shall be male and female.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Of the birds according to their kind, and of the cattle according to their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind. Two of every sort shall come to thee, to keep them alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee, and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
