And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord Esau, Thus says thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants. And I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he comes to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, If Esau comes to the one company, and smites it, then the company which is left shall escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou have shown to thy servant, for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau. For I fear him, lest he comes and smites me, the mother with the sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou said, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose are thou? And where do thou go? And whose are these before thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then thou shall say, Thy servant Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord Esau. And, behold, he also is behind us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all who followed the herds, saying, On this manner shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained as he wrestled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let thee go unless thou bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for thou have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Why is it that thou ask for my name? And he blessed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel [Peniel], and he limped upon his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
