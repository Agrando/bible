And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. And they came into the land o</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And LORD appeared to Abram, and said, I will give this land to thy seed. And there he built an altar to LORD, who appeared to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he moved from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to LORD, and called upon the name of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when he came near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou are a fair woman to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife.

Why did thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why did thou say, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore behold thy wife. Take her, and go thy way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pharaoh gave men command concerning him. And they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
