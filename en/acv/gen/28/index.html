And he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take for him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him an order, saying, Thou shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he touched upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And, behold, the agents of God ascending and descending on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And, behold, LORD stood above it, and said, I am LORD, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land on which thou lay, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee wherever thou go, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jacob awoke out of his sleep, and he said, Surely LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he was afraid, and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and LORD will be my God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth to thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
