He set it in a city of merchants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it as a willow tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots of it were under him. So it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. And, behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It was planted in a good soil by many waters that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Say thou, Thus says lord LORD: Shall it flourish? Shall he not pull up the roots of it, and cut off the fruit of it, that it may wither? It shall wither in all its fresh springing leaves, even without great power or many people to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, behold, being planted, shall it flourish? Shall it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king of it, and the rulers of it, and brought them to him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him. He also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt that they might give him horses and many people. Shall he prosper? Shall he escape who does such things? Shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As I live, says lord LORD, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant. And, behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things. He shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says lord LORD: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all his fugitives in all his groups shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind. And ye shall know that I, LORD, have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says lord LORD: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it. I will crop off a tender one from the topmost of its young twigs, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will plant it in the mountain of the height of Israel, and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar. And all birds of every wing shall dwell under it; they shall dwell in the shade of the branches thereo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the trees of the field shall know that I, LORD, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. I, LORD, have spoken and have done it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
