And this was their appearance. They had the likeness of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And each one had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like burnished brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. And those four had their faces and their wings [thus]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their wings were joined one to another. They did not turn when they went; they went each one straight forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. And those four had the face of a lion on the right side, and those four had the face of an ox on the left side, those four also had the face of an eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And their faces and their wings were separate above, two [wings] of each one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went each one straight forward. Where the spirit was to go, they went. They did not turn when they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It went up and down among the living creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth l</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel [was] upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl.

They did not turn when they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As for their rims, they were high and fearful. And those four had their rims full of eyes round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. And when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there the spirit was to go. And the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like awesome crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And under the firmament their wings were straight, the one toward the other.
