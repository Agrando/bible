And it was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And LORD said to me, This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, nor shall any man enter in by it, for LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it. Therefore it shall be shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As for the ruler, he shall sit in it as ruler to eat bread before LORD. He shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house. And I looked, and, behold, the glory of LORD filled the house of LORD. And I fell upon my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And LORD said to me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of LORD, and all the laws of it.
