Thus says lord LORD to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have be</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>therefore thus says lord LORD: Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, who have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, wit</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus says lord LORD: I have sworn, [saying], Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they are at hand to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and ye shall be tilled and sown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it, and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited according to your former estate, and will do better [to you] than at your beginnings. And ye shall know that</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel, and they shall possess thee, and thou shall be their inheritance, and thou shall no more henceforth bereave them of sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says lord LORD: Because they say to you, Thou [O land] are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of thy nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore thou shall no more devour men, nor bereave thy nation any more, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, nor shall thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, nor shall thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their way and according to their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name, in that men said of them, These are the people of LORD, and have gone forth out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says lord LORD: I do not do [this] for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations where ye went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them. And the nations shall know that I am LORD, says lord LORD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their ey</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and from all your idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my ordinances, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I will save you from all your uncleannesses. And I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may no more receive the reproach of famine among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then ye shall remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good. And ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I do [this] not for your sake, says lord LORD; be it known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus says lord LORD: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they shall say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. And the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, LORD, have built the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate. I, LORD, have spoken it, and I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus says lord LORD: For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them. I will increase them with men like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I am LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
