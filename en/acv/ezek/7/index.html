The end has come upon the four corners of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the end is upon thee, and I will send my anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways. And I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And my eye shall not spare thee, nor will I have pity. But I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee. And ye shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says lord LORD: An evil, an only evil, behold, it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end has come. The end has come. It awakens against thee. Behold, it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thy doom has come to thee, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come. The day is near, tumult, and not joyful shouting, upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I will shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish my anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways.

Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all the multitude of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive, for the vision is concerning the whole multitude of it. None shall return, nor shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready, but none goes to the battle, for my wrath is upon all the multitude of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine inside. He who is in the field shall die with the sword, and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But those of them who escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys.
