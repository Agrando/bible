The deep made it to grow. The rivers of it ran round about its plantation, and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field, and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long because of many waters, when it shot [them] forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs, and under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young, and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was by many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The cedars in the garden of God could not dim it.

Upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land. And all the peoples</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the birds of the heavens shall dwell upon his ruin, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, [even] all that drink water.
