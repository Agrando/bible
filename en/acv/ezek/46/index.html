Thou shall prepare it morning by morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shall prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour, a meal-offering to LORD continually by a perpetual ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus they shall prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says lord LORD: If the ruler gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance. It shall belong to his sons. It is their possession by inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty, then it shall return to the ruler.
