And the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looks</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then he said to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and, behold, northward of the gate of the altar [was] this image of jealousy in the entry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, Son of man, see thou what they do, even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But thou shall again see yet other great abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he brought me to the door of the court.
