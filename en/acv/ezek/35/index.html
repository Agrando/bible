And thou shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because thou have had a perpetual enmity, and have given over the sons of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>therefore, as I live, says lord LORD, I will prepare thee to blood, and blood shall pursue thee. Since thou have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus I will make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation, and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will fill its mountains with its slain. In thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses they shall fall who are slain with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited. And ye shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because thou have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it, whereas LORD was there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>therefore, as I live, says lord LORD, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou have shown out of thy hatred against them. And I will make myself known among them when I shall judge thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shall know that I, LORD, have heard all thy revilings which thou have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate. They are given us to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me. I have heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says lord LORD: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make thee desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As thou rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will do to thee. Thou shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it, and they shall know that I am LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
