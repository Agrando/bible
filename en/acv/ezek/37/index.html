And, behold, there were very many in the open valley, and, lo, they were very dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O lord LORD, thou know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says lord LORD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live. And ye shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says lord LORD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are clean cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall know that I am LORD when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live. And I will place you in your own land. And ye shall know that I, LORD, have spoken it and performed it, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The word of LORD came again to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his companions.
