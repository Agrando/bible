Should I be inquired of at all by them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet, I LORD will</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says lord LORD: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, that separates himself from me, and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prop</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb. And I will cut him off from the midst of my people. And ye shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, LORD, have deceived that prophet. And I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him who seeks [him],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves any more with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>though these three men were in it, as I live, says lord LORD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, they only would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, so that I cut off from it man and beast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>though these three men were in it, as I live, says lord LORD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only would be delivered themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says lord LORD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter, they would but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For thus says lord LORD: How much more when I send my four severe judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant in it that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come forth to you, and ye shall see their way and their doings.
