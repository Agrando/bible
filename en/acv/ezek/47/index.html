And, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the forefront of the house was toward the east. And the waters came down from under, from the right</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of [the gate] that looks toward the east. And, behold, waters ran out on the right side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters], waters that were to the loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Afterward he measured a thousand, [and it was] a river that I could not pass through, for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, Son of man, have thou seen [this]? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah. And they shall go toward the sea, into the sea which were made to issue forth, and the waters shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, shall live. And there shall be a very great multitude of fish (for these waters have come there) and shall be healed. And eve</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall come to pass, that fishermen shall stand by it. From En-gedi even to En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, very many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the miry places of it, and the marshes of it, shall not be healed. They shall be given up to salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the river upon the bank of it, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, nor shall the fruit of it fail. It shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters of it</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says lord LORD: This shall be the border by which ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph [shall have two] portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, for I swore to give it to your fathers. And this land shall fall to you for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan, from the [north] border to the east sea ye shall measure. This is the east side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea. This is the south side southward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the west side shall be the great sea, from the [south] border as far as opposite the entrance of Hamath.
