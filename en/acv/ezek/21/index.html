And will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword shall go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And all flesh shall know that I, LORD, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath. It shall not return any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sigh therefore, thou son of man. With the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness thou shall sigh before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it shall be, when they say to thee, Why do thou sigh? That thou shall say, Because of the news. For it comes, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says LORD: Say, A sword, a sword. It is sharpened, and also furbished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It is sharpened that it may make a slaughter. It is polished that it may be as lightning. Shall we then make mirth? It scorns the scepter of my son, every tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it is given to be polished, that it may be handled. The sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Cry and wail, son of man, for it is upon my people. It is upon all the rulers of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Smite therefore upon thy thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For there is a trial, and what if even the rod that scorns shall be no more? says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together. And let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded. It is the sword of the great [man] who is deadly wounded, which enters into their cha</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied. Ah! It is made as lightning. It is pointed for slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gather thee together. Go to the right. Set thyself in array. Go to the left, wherever thy face is set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest. I, LORD, have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The word of LORD came to me again, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. Those two shall come forth out of one land. And mark out a place. Mark it out at the head of the way to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook the arrows to and fro. He consulted the teraphim. He looked in the liver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In his right hand was the divination [for] Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall be to them as a FALSE divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them. But he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear, because ye have come to remembrance, ye shall be taken w</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thou, O deadly wounded wicked man, the ruler of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>thus says lord LORD: Remove the miter, and take off the crown. This [shall be] no more the same. Exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. This also shall be no more, until he comes whose right it is. And I will give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says lord LORD concerning the sons of Ammon, and concerning their reproach. And say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn. It is polished for the slaughter, to cause it to devour, that it may</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>while they see for thee FALSE visions, while they divine lies to thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou were created, in the land of thy birth, I will judge thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will pour out my indignation upon thee. I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thou shall be for fuel to the fire. Thy blood shall be in the midst of the land. Thou shall no more be remembered. For I, LORD, have spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
