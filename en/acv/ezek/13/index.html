And they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Have ye not seen a FALSE vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, LORD says, albeit I have not spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And my hand shall be against the prophets who see FALSE visions, and who divine lies. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace, and there is no peace, and when [a man] builds up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered [mortar],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>say to those who daub it with untempered [mortar], that it shall fall. There shall be an overflowing shower, and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall rend it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Lo, when the wall has fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says lord LORD: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath, and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered. And it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst of it. And ye</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have daubed it with untempered [mortar]. And I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who daubed it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[namely], the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart, and prophesy thou against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And say, Thus says lord LORD: Woe to the women who sew pillows upon all elbows, and make headdresses for the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die, and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore thus says lord LORD: Behold, I am against your pillows, with which ye hunt the souls there to make fly, and I will tear them from your arms. And I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make fly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will also tear your headdresses, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted. And ye shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore ye shall no more see FALSE visions, nor divine divinations. And I will deliver my people out of your hand. And ye shall know that I am LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
