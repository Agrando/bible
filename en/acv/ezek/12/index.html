And thou shall move from thy place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And thou shall bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving. And thou shall go forth thyself at evening in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out by that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou shall bear it upon thy shoulder in their sight, and carry it forth in the dark. Thou shall cover thy face, that thou not see the land. For I have set thee for a sign to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I did so as I was commanded. I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it forth in the dark, and bore it upon my shoulder in their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in the morning the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, What are thou doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say thou to them, Thus says lord LORD: This burden [concerns] the ruler in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Say, I am your sign. Just as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the ruler who is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth. They shall dig through the wall to carry out by it. He shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will also spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will scatter toward every wind all who are round about him to help him, and all his groups. And I will draw out the sword after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they shall know that I am LORD, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. And they shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And say to the people of the land, Thus says lord LORD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation. And ye shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Tell them therefore, Thus says lord LORD: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel, but say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For there shall no more be any FALSE vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I am LORD. I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed. It shall be no more deferred. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Again the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Son of man, behold, those of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many day to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore say to them, Thus says lord LORD: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, says lord LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
