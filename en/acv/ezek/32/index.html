Yet thou are as a monster in the seas, and thou broke forth with thy rivers, and troubled the waters w</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thus says lord LORD: I will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples, and they shall bring thee up in my net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will leave thee upon the land. I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will also water the land, in which thou swim, with thy blood, even to the mountains. And the watercourses shall be full of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars of it dark. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the bright lights of heaven I will make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will also vex the hearts of many peoples when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee. And their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when I shall brandish my sword before them. And they shall tremble at every moment, each man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thus says lord LORD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>By the swords of the mighty I will cause thy multitude to fall. They are all the terrible of the nations. And they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude of it shall be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters. Neither the foot of man shall trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I shall smite all those who dwell therein, then they shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the lamentation with which they shall lament. The daughters of the nations shall lament with that over Egypt, and over all her multitude. They shall lament with that, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day] of the month, that the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, to the nether parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whom do thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her away and all her multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him. They have gone down. They lay still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Asshur is there and all her company. Her graves are round about her, all of them slain, fallen by the sword,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>whose graves are set in the outermost parts of the pit. And her company is round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have bor</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They have set a bed for her in the midst of the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are round about her, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

Their graves are round about them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, for they caused their terror in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they shall not lay with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads. But their iniquities are upon their bones, for [they w</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But thou shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shall lay with those who are slain by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There is Edom, her kings and all her rulers, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword. They shall lay with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There are the rulers of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain. In the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame. And they lay uncircumcised with those who are slain by</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I have put his terror in the land of the living, and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, says lord LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
