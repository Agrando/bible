And, behold, at the door of the gate twenty-five men. And I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>who say, [The time] is not near to build houses. This [city] is the caldron, and we are the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, O son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Spirit of LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, Speak, Thus says LORD: Thus ye have said, O house of Israel, for I know the things that come into your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus says lord LORD: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this [city] is the caldron, but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ye have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ye shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel, and ye shall know that I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This [city] shall not be your caldron, nor shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof. I will judge you in the border of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and ye shall know that I am LORD. For ye have not walked in my statutes, nor have ye executed my ordinances, but have done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah lord LORD! Will thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the word of LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Son of man, thy brothers, even thy brothers, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, [are those] to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from LORD. This land is given to us for a posses</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore say, Thus says lord LORD: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore say, Thus says lord LORD. I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall come there, and they shall take away from there all the detestable things of it and all the abominations of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as for those whose heart walks according to the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, says lord LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the glory of LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those of the captivity.
