Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, of three days' journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey. And he cried out, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the people of Nineveh believed God, and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed, nor drink water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily to God. Yea, let them turn each one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we not perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. And God relented of the evil which he said he would do to them, and he did not do it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
