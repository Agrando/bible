And he divided to them his living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And not many days after, the younger son, having gathered all together, journeyed into a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth living recklessly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he spent all, a mighty famine developed in that country, and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having gone, he was joined to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he longed to fill his belly from the husks that the swine ate, and no man gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when he came to himself, he said, How many hired men of my father's have abundance of loaves, but I am perishing with hunger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>After rising, I will go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having risen, he went to his father. But while he was still distant, afar off, his father saw him and felt compassion. And having ran, he fell on his neck, and kissed him much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight. I am no more worthy to be called thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his bondmen, Bring forth the best robe and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand, and shoes for his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having brought the fatted calf, kill it, and having eaten, we will be cheerful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because this my son was dead, and became alive again. And he was lost, and is found. And they began to be cheerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But his elder son was in a field. And while coming, having approached the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having summoned one of the boys, and inquired what these things might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, Thy brother arrived, and thy father has killed the fatted calf, because he received him back healthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore, his father having come out, he called him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But having answered, he said to his father, Lo, so many years do I serve thee, and I never passed by a commandment of thine, and yet thou never gave me a goat that I might be merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when this thy son came, who has devoured thy living with harlots, thou killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Child, thou are always with me, and all my things are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But it was needful to make merry and be glad, because this thy brother was dead, and became alive again, and was lost, and was found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
