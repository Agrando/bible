Follow him into the house where he enters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And ye shall say to the house-ruler, The teacher says to thee, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will show you a large upper room furnished. Prepare there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And having gone, they found just as he said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the hour came, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before my suffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I say to you, that I will eat of it no more, no, not till when it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having taken a cup, having expressed thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I say to you, that I will, no, not drink from the fruit of the grapevine till when the kingdom of God comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And after taking bread, having expressed thanks, he broke in pieces, and gave to them, saying, This is my body that is given for you. Do ye this in my memory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Likewise also the cup after dining, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood being shed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless behold, the hand of the man who betrays me is with me on the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Son of man indeed goes according to that which has been determined, nevertheless woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they began to question among themselves who then of them would be going do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And also a dispute develop among them, which of them is considered to be greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles have dominion over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called Benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But ye are not this way. Rather, the greater among you, shall become as the newer, and he who leads, as he who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For who ranks higher, he who sits dining, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits dining? But I am in the midst of you as he who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But ye are those who have continued with me in my trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I appoint to you, just as my Father appointed to me a kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you to sift you as wheat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I prayed for thee, so that thy faith may not fail. And thou, when thou have returned, strengthen thy brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I say to thee, Peter, a cock will, no, not sound today, before thou will thrice deny that thou know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, When I sent you without bag and pouch and shoes, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he said to them, But now, he who has a bag, let him take it, and likewise a pouch. And he who has no sword, let him sell his cloak and buy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say to you, that this that is written is still necessary to be completed in me, And he was counted with lawless men, for these things about me also have fulfillment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having come out, he proceeded according to his habit to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he came at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw. And he knelt down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, Father, if thou want, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And an agent from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And having become in agony he prayed more intensely, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And after rising up from his prayer, having come to the disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And said to them, Why sleep ye? Having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he yet spoke, behold, a multitude, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them. And he came near to Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said to him, Judas, thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And when those who were around him saw what would be, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And a certain one of them struck the bondman of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But having answered, Jesus said, Allow ye as far as this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, who came to him, Have ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was with you daily in the temple, ye did not stretch forth hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And having seized him, they led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But a certain servant girl having seen him sitting near the light, and having looked intently upon him, she said, This man was also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied him, saying, Woman, I do not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while, another man having see him, said, Thou also are from them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And about one hour having passed, some other man insisted, saying, In truth this man was also with him, for he is also a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter said, Man, I do not know what thou are saying. And immediately, while he still spoke, a cock sounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And having turned, the Lord looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before a cock sounds thou will deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And having gone outside, Peter wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men who held Jesus mocked him, while striking him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And having covered him, they struck his face, and demanded him, saying, Prophesy! Who is he who struck thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And they spoke many other things against him, railing against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And when it became day, the eldership of the people, the chief priests, and the scholars, came together, and led him into their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>If thou are the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I also ask, ye will, no, not answer nor release.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>From henceforth the Son of man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And they all said, Therefore thou are the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What further need have we of testimony? For we have heard from his mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
