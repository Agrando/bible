May thy kingdom come, may thy will happen on the earth as also in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Give us our bread sufficient for each day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive every man who is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>since a friend arrived from the road to me, and I do not have what I would set before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and that man from inside, having answered, would say, Do not cause toils for me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I am not able, after getting up, to give thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to you, though he will not give him, after getting up, because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, having awaken, he will give him as many as he needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and ye will find. Knock, and it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For every man who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And which father of you, if the son will ask a loaf, will give him a stone, or also if a fish, in place of a fish will give him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Or if he should ask for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more the Father from heaven will give Holy Spirit to those who ask him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he was casting out a demon, and it was mute. And it happened when the demon was gone out, the mute man spoke. And the multitudes marveled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but some of them said, He casts out the demons by Beelzebub, ruler of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And others, challenging, sought from him a sign from the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom that was divided against itself is made desolate, and a house against a house falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom be made to stand? Because ye say that I cast out the demons by Beelzebub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if I cast out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this they will be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if by a finger of God I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When the fully armed strong man guards his palace, the things possessed by him are in peace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but when a stronger than he comes, after defeating him, he takes away his full armor in which he trusted, and divides his booty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the unclean spirit departs out of the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest. And not finding, it says, I will return to my house from where I came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then it goes, and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having enter in, it dwells there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman, having lifted up her voice out of the crowd, said to him, Blessed is the belly that bore thee, and the breasts that thou suckled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he said, Blessed rather, are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when the multitudes gathered together he began to say, This generation is evil. They seek a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah, the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of man will be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the south will awake in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And no man, having lit a lamp, puts it in a concealed place, nor under the bushel, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of thy body is the eye. Therefore, when thine eye is sound, thy whole body is also bright, but when it is bad, thy body is also dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Watch therefore the light in thee not be darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore thy whole body is bright, not having any part dark, the whole will be bright, as when the lamp illuminates thee by the radiance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now as he spoke a certain Pharisee asks him that he might dine with him. And having entered in, he sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when the Pharisee saw, he marveled that he did not first wash before dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your interior is full of plundering and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Ye foolish men, did not he who made the outside also make the inside?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But give compassion, things that are inside, and behold, all things are clean to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But woe to you Pharisees! Because ye tithe mint and rue and every plant, and pass by justice and the love of God. It is necessary to do these things, and not to neglect those things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Woe to you Pharisees! Because ye love the place of honor in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Woe to you scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye are like the unseen sepulchers, and the men who walk over them do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And having answered, a certain man of the lawyers says to him, Teacher, in saying these things thou rebuke us also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said, Woe also to you lawyers! Because ye load men with burdens difficult to bear, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Woe to you! Because ye build the sepulchers of the prophets, but your fathers killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Consequently, ye testify and approve the works of your fathers, because they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because of this also the wisdom of God said, I will send to them prophets and apostles. And some of them they will kill and persecute,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>so that the blood of all the prophets that was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I say to you, it will be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Woe to you lawyers! Because ye took away the key of knowledge. Ye did not enter in yourselves, and ye hindered those who were entering in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And after he said these things to them, the scholars and the Pharisees began to harass him extremely, and to provoke him to speak impulsively about more things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>waiting to ambush him, seeking to catch something out of his mouth so that they might accuse him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
