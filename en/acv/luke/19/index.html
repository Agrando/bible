And he was a chief tax collector, and this man was rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he sought to see Jesus, who he was. And he was not able because of the crowd, because his stature was small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And having ran ahead, he climbed up in a sycomore tree so that he might see him, because he was going to pass that one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Jesus came to the place, having looked up, he saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, after making haste, come down, for today I must lodge at thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And having made haste, he came down and received him, rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all who saw murmured, saying, He went in to relax with a sinful man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having stood, Zacchaeus said to the Lord, Behold, half of the things possessed by me, Lord, I give to the poor. And if I defrauded any man of anything, I repay fourfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as they heard these things, he spoke, adding on a parable because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And having called ten of his bondmen, he gave them ten minas and said to them, Do business until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy behind him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass for him to return, having taken the kingdom. And he said for these bondmen to be called to him, to whom he gave the silver, so that he might know what any man gained by trading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the first came, saying, Lord, thy mina gained ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, Well, thou good bondman. Because thou became faithful in the least, be thou having authority over ten cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the second came, saying, Lord, thy mina gained five minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he also said to him, And thou become over five cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another came, saying, Lord, behold thy mina, which I had put away in a napkin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I was afraid of thee because thou are an austere man. Thou take up what thou did not lay down, and reap what thou did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He says to him, Out of thy mouth I will judge thee, thou evil bondman. Thou had known that I am an austere man taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then why did thou not give my silver into a bank, and having come I would have collected it with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For I say to you, that to every man who has, will be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nevertheless those enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring here, and kill them before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having spoke these things, he went ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Go ye into the opposite village, in which, having entered, ye will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Having untied, bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if any man asks you, Why do ye untie it? Thus ye will say to him, The Lord has need of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And having departed, those who were sent found just as he said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were untying the colt, the masters of it said to them, Why do ye untie the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord has need of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought it to Jesus. And having cast their garments upon the colt, they mounted Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went, they spread their garments on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as he was now coming near, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God in a great voice about all the mighty works that they had seen, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Blessed is the King who comes in the name of Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having answered, he said to them, I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he came near, having seen the city, he wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, If thou knew, even thou, indeed even in this thy day, the things for thy peace. But now they are hidden from thine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because the days will come upon thee, and thine enemies will build a barricade around thee, and will surround thee, and enclose thee on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they will raze thee and thy children within thee. And they will not leave in thee a stone upon a stone, because thou knew not the time of thy visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And having entered into the temple, he began to cast out those selling and buying in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but ye made it a den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scholars sought to destroy him, even the foremost men of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And they did not find what they might do, for the people all hung upon him, listening.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
