And thou shall call his name John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there will be joy and exultation for thee, and many will rejoice at his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he should, no, not drink wine and strong drink. And he will be filled of Holy Spirit, even from his mother's belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he will go ahead, in front of him, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn back the hearts of fathers toward children, and the disobedient in a mentality of the righteous, to make ready for Lord a people prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Zacharias said to the agent, How will I know this? For I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having answered, the agent said to him, I am Gabriel who stand in the presence of God. And I was sent to speak to thee, and to announce these good news to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, thou will be mute, and not able to speak until that day these things will come to pass, because thou did not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they wondered during his delay in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was beckoning to them, and remained speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she concealed herself five months, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus the Lord has done to me during the days in which he looked, to take away my shame among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now in the sixth month the agent Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the agent having come in near her, he said, Hail, thou who are highly favored. The Lord is with thee, thou who are blessed among women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But having seen, she was perplexed at his saying, and was pondering what kind of greeting this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the agent said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And behold, thou will conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son. And thou shall call his name JESUS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This man will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he will reign over the house of Jacob into the ages. And of his kingdom there will be no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Mary said to the agent, How will this be, since I know not a man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having answered, the agent said to her, Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee. Therefore also the holy thing that is begotten will be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And behold, Elizabeth thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For no word from God will be impossible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Mary said, Behold the maid-servant of Lord. May it happen to me according to thy word. And the agent departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having risen in these days, Mary went with haste into the hill country, into a city of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her belly. And Elizabeth was filled of Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and she exclaimed in a great voice, and said, Blessed are thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And why is this to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For lo, when the voice of thy greeting happened in my ears, the babe leaped with joy in my belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed is she who believed, because there will be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her from Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>because he has looked upon the lowliness of his bondmaid. For behold, from henceforth all generations will regard me blessed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>because the Mighty has done great things to me. And his name is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy is for generations of generations to those who fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He did a mighty work by his arm. He scattered the proud in the mentality of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He brought down potentates from thrones, and raised up lowly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He filled those who are hungry with good things, and those who are rich he sent away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He helped his boy Israel to be reminded of mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham and his seed into the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary dwelt with her about three months, and returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the time for Elizabeth was fulfilled for her to give birth, and she brought forth a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbors and her kinfolk heard that Lord magnified his mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child, and they were calling it by the name of his father Zacharias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother having answered, said, No, but he will be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said to her, There is no man among thy relatives who is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they made signs to his father, whatever he wanted to call him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue, and he spoke, praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear developed in all who dwell around them. And all these sayings were talked about in the entire hill country of Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all who heard stored up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father Zacharias was filled of Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed is Lord, the God of Israel, because he came to help, and made ransom for his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his boy David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>just as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>to do mercy with our fathers, and his holy covenant to be remembered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>the oath that he swore to Abraham our father, to give to us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>without fear from the hand of our enemies, having been saved to serve him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in piety and righteousness before him all our the days of our life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And thou, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High. For thou will go ahead, before the face of Lord, to prepare his ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>because of the bowels of mercy of our God, by which the dayspring from on high came to help us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>to give light to those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into a way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit. And he was in the desolate regions until the day of his manifestation to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
