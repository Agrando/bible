And if thy brother should sin against thee, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if he should sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times in the day turn back, saying, I repent, thou will forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase faith for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard plant, ye would say to this sycamine tree, Be thou uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But which of you having a bondman plowing or feeding livestock, who, when he comes in from the field, will straightaway say, After coming near, sit down?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will he not rather say to him, Prepare what I may dine, and having gird thyself, serve me until I eat and drink, and after these things thou will eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Does he have a favor for that bondman because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus ye also, when ye did all the things that were commanded you, say, We are unprofitable bondmen, because we have done what we are obligated to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem, that he was passing through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he entered into a certain village, ten leprous men who stood from afar met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they raised a voice, saying, Jesus, Master, be merciful to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he saw them, he said to them, After departing, display yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, during their going they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back with a great voice glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he fell upon his face beside his feet giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having answered, Jesus said, Were not the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, After rising, go. Thy faith has healed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And questioned by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor will they say, Lo, here! or, Lo, there! For behold, the kingdom of God is inside of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to the disciples, The days will come when ye will long to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you, Lo, here! Lo, there! Do not depart, nor pursue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For just as the lightning, its flashing from under the sky to under the sky, illuminates, so will the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things and be rejected from this generation.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so also it will be in the days of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And likewise as it happened in the days of Lot. They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But in that day Lot went out from Sodom he rained fire and brimstone from the sky, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It will be according to these things in that day the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his vessels in the house, let him not go down to take them up. And let him who is in the field likewise not return for the things behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever will seek to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose it will keep it alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I say to you, in that night there will be two in one bed. The one man will be taken, and the other man will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two will be grinding together. The one woman will be taken, and the other woman will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>\cf15\I [This verse is not in the majority of the Greek manuscripts.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And having answered, they say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body is, there the vultures will be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
