Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he then find faith on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he also spoke this parable to some of those who were persuaded in themselves that they were righteous, and disdained other men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Having stood by himself, the Pharisee prayed these things: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, predatory, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice per Sabbath. I tithe all things, as many as I acquire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the tax collector, having stood from afar, would not even lift his eyes to the sky, but beat upon his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinful man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that man. Because every man who lifts himself up will be made lower, and he who makes himself lower will be lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they were also bringing the infants to him, so that he would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But having summoned them, Jesus said, Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child, will, no, not enter into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, Good teacher, having done what, will I inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to him, Why do thou call me good? None is good except one, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou know the commandments. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not give FALSE testimony. Honor thy father and thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he heard these things, Jesus said to him, Yet one thing is lacking from thee. Sell all things, as many as thou have, and distribute to the poor, and thou will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he heard these things, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having seen him become very sorrowful, Jesus said, How difficultly those who have riches will enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier for a camel to enter in through the hole of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And those who heard it said, And who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, The things impossible with men are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter said, Lo, we have left all and followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, Truly I say to you, that there is no man who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will, no, not receive back manifold more in this time, and in the coming age eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And having taken along the twelve, he said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets about the Son of man will be completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, and he will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after scourging, they will kill him, and the third day he will rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they understood none of these things, and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things that were said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass as he approached Jericho, a certain blind man sat beside the road begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having heard a multitude going by, he inquired what this may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they informed him that Jesus the Nazarene passes by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried out, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, be merciful to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who went ahead rebuked him, so that he would be quiet, but he cried out much more, Thou son of David, be merciful to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having stood still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he questioned him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>saying, What do thou want that I would do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, Receive sight. Thy faith has healed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he received sight, and followed him glorifying God. And all the people when they saw it gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
