And having sat down, he taught the crowds from the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the depth, and let down your nets for a catch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And having answered, Simon said to him, Master, having toiled through the whole night, we took nothing, but at thy saying, I will let down the net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net was tearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they beckoned to their partners in the other boat, after coming, to assist them. And they came and filled both the boats, so as for them to be sunk down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Simon Peter having seen, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, because I am a sinful man, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For astonishment surrounded him, and all those with him, at the catch of the fishes that they caught,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not, from henceforth thou will be catching men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they brought their boats to land, after forsaking all, they followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy. And having seen Jesus, having fallen on his face, he besought him, saying, Lord, if thou will, thou can make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And having stretched forth his hand, he touched him, having said, I will, be thou clean. And straightaway the leprosy departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he commanded him to tell no man, but, After going, show thyself to the priest, and bring concerning thy cleansing, just as Moses commanded for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the report about him went through more, and many multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him from their infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he himself was withdrawing into the desolate regions, and praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass during one of those days, he was also teaching. And there were seated Pharisees and law teachers, who were men having come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of Lord was to heal</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And behold, men bringing a man on a bed who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not having found how they might bring him in because of the multitude, after going up upon the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with the small bed into the midst in front of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having seen their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the scholars and the Pharisees began to deliberate, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, except God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, having responded, he said to them, Why do ye deliberate in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that ye may know that the Son of man has authority upon earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralyzed man), I say to thee, Arise, and after taking up thy small bed, go to thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately having risen up before them, after taking up that on which he lay, he departed to his house glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And amazement gripped all, and they glorified God. And they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after these things he went forth and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And he said to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And after leaving behind all, having risen up, he followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made a great feast for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were relaxing with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their scholars and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And having answered, Jesus said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those faring badly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said to them, Ye cannot make the sons of the wedding hall fast while the bridegroom is with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will also come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he also spoke a parable to them. No man puts a patch of a new garment on an old garment, otherwise both the new tears, and that from the new will not blend with the old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no man puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the new wine will burst the wineskins, and will itself be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And no man having drunk old straightaway desires new, for he says, The old is better.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
