Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day to rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they remembered his sayings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And having returned from the sepulcher, they reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and they disbelieved them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But having risen, Peter ran to the sepulcher. And having stooped down, he sees the linen cloths laying alone. And he departed, wondering to himself at that which happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And behold, two of them were going the same day to a village that was sixty furlongs away from Jerusalem, which name was Emmaus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they conversed with each other about all these things that happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, while they conversed and discussed, that Jesus himself also having approached, went along with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes were held, not to recognize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, What are these words that ye toss back to each other, while walking and are looking sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And one, whose name was Cleopas, having answered, said to him, Thou only visit Jerusalem and do not know the things that happened in it during these days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to them, What? And they said to him, The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who became a prophet, a mighty man in work and word before God and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up for condemnation of death, and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we hoped that he is the man who is going to redeem Israel. But even with all these things, it brings this third day today from which time these things happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But also some of our women astonished us, having come to be at the sepulcher early morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not having found his body, they came, saying also to have seen a vision of heavenly agents who say he is alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some of those with us went to the sepulcher, and found it this way, just as also the women said, but they did not see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things about himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came near to the village where they were going, and he pretended to go further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they constrained him, saying, Remain with us, because it is toward evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass during his dining with them, that, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken in pieces he gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he became invisible from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said to each other, Was not our heart burning within us while he spoke to us on the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And having risen up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and those who were with them who said, The Lord really was raised, and was seen by Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they reported the things on the road, and how he was made known to them during the breaking of the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them, Peace to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But having seen startled, and having become frightened, they presumed to see a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as ye see me having.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having said this, he displayed to them his hands and feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And while they still disbelieved from joy and wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything to eat here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and from a bees honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having taken it, he ate before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said to them, These are the words that I spoke to you while still being with you, that it is necessary for all things that are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms about me to be fulfulled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their mind to understand the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and to proclaim in his name repentance and remission of sins for all the nations, having begun from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And ye are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you. But stay ye in the city until ye are clothed with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he led them outside as far as to Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was brought up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And having worshiping him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Truly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
