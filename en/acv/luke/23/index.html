And having answered him, he said, Thou say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find nothing guilty in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they were emphatic, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, having begun from Galilee as far as here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Pilate heard Galilee, he questioned if the man is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he perceived that he is from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem in these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he was wanting of a considerable time to see him, because of hearing many things about him, and he hoped to see some sign happening by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he interrogated him in considerable words, but he answered him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests and the scholars had stood, vehemently accusing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Herod having disdained him with his soldiers, and having mocked him, having arraying him in a bright robe, he sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And both Pilate and Herod became friends with each other on the same day, for they were formerly being at enmity toward themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>said to them, Ye brought this man to me as turning away the people. And behold, I, having examined him before you, found nothing guilty in this man of what ye accuse against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But not even Herod, for I sent you back to him, and lo, nothing having been done by him is worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, having scourged I will release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now he had need to release one man to them at every feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they cried out all together, saying, Take away this man, and release to us Barabbas</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(a man who was cast into prison because of a certain insurrection that occurred in the city, and for murder).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again therefore Pilate called out wanting to release Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to them a third time, For what evil did this man do? I have found nothing guilty of death in him. I will therefore, having scourged, release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were relentless with loud voices demanding him to be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate decreed their request to happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released the man who had been cast into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they asked for, but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when they led him away, having taken hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian coming from the countryside, they laid the cross on him to bring behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a great multitude of the people followed him, and also of women who bewailed and lamented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But having turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, instead weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because, behold, the days are coming, during which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the bellies that gave no birth, and the breasts that did not suckle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And two other men, malefactors, were also led with him to be executed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one at the right hand and the other at the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. And dividing his garments, they cast a lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people had stood watching. And also the rulers with them sneered, saying, He saved others. He should save himself, if this is the Christ, the chosen of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the soldiers also mocked him, approaching, and bringing him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, If thou are the king of the Jews, save thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And there was also an inscription over him written in letters, in Greek and Latin and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed him, saying, If thou are the Christ, save thyself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other man having answered, rebuking him, saying, Thou fear not even God, since thou are in the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly, for we receive worthy of what we did, but this man did nothing amiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou come into thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to thee, today thou will be with me in the paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness occurred over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the sun was darkened, and the curtain of the temple was torn in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus, having sounded out in a great voice, said, Father, into thy hands I entrust my spirit. And having said these things, he expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when the centurion saw that which happened, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the multitudes who came together to this scene, watching that which happened, turned back, beating their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all his acquaintances, and the women who accompanied him from Galilee, had stood from afar, seeing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And behold a man named Joseph, a council member, being a good and righteous man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(this man not having consented to their purpose and deed), was from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also himself awaited the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man having gone to Pilate, requested the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher cut in rock, of which no man was yet lain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the day was beginning. It was a preparation Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And having followed closely, the women who were gathered to him out of Galilee, they saw the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And having returned, they prepared spices and ointments. And they indeed rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
