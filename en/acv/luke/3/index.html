Make his paths straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be brought low. And the crooked things will be into straight and the rough into smooth ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all flesh will see the salvation of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be immersed by him, Ye offspring of vipers, who showed you to flee from the coming wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore not making good fruit is cut down, and cast into fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the crowds questioned him, saying, What then shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And having answered, he says to them, He who has two coats, let him share with him not having, and he who has food, let him do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And tax collectors also came to be immersed, and they said to him, Teacher, what should we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, Collect not one thing more than from what has been appointed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And men who were soldiers also questioned him, saying, And we, what should we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as the people were expectant, and all pondering in their hearts about John, if perhaps he was the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>John responded, saying to them all, I indeed immerse you in water, but a man mightier than I comes, of whom I am not worthy to unloose the strap of his shoes. He will immerse you in Holy Spirit and fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>whose winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Indeed therefore, also exhorting the people with many other things, he preached the good-news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him about Herodias his brother's wife, and about all of which evil things Herod had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>also added this to them all, he even locked up John in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now it came to pass, during the immersion of all the people, Jesus also having been immersed and praying, for the heaven to be opened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the Holy Spirit to descend in a bodily form as a dove upon him, and a voice to occur out of heaven, saying, Thou are my beloved Son.
