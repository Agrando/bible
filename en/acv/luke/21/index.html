And what is the sign when these things are going to happen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, Watch that ye may not be led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, I am, and, The time has come near. Go ye not therefore after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when ye may hear of wars and tumults, do not be alarmed, for these things must first happen, but the end is not straightaway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great earthquakes will be in various places, and famines and plagues. And there will be fearful sights and great signs from the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all these things, they will throw their hands on you, and will persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But it will go out from you for testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Settle therefore in your hearts not to premeditate to make defense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I will give you a mouth and wisdom that all those who oppose you will not be able to contradict or to resist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And ye will be betrayed even by parents, and kinsmen, and friends, and brothers. And some of you they will condemn to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And ye will be hated by all men because of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, no, not a hair of your head will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In your perseverance ye gain your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when ye see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that the desolation of it has come near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those in the midst of it depart out, and let not those in the countrysides enter into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because these are days of vengeance to fulfill all things that are written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But woe to those who have in the womb, and to those who suckle in those days. For there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they will fall by the jaw of the sword, and will be led away captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, roaring of sea and of tossing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>fainting of men from fear, and of anticipation of the things coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and much glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when these things begin to happen, stand upright, and lift up your heads, because your redemption approaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke a parable to them. Behold the fig tree, and all the trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When they are now sprouting, ye know seeing for yourselves that summer is now near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Even so ye, when ye see these things happening, know ye that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Truly I say to you, that this generation will, no, not pass away until all things happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words may, no, not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down in debauchery and drunkenness and mundane cares, and that day come upon you sudden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For it will come like a trap upon all those who sit upon the face of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Watch ye therefore, making supplication at all times, so that ye may be considered worthy to escape all these things going to happen, and to stand before the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And during the days he was teaching in the temple, and going forth the nights, he lodged on the mount that is called Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And all the people rose early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
