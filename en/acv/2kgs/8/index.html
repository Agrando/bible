And she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it came to pass at the end of seven years, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines, and she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Elisha came to Damascus, and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. And it was told him, saying, The man of God has come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recov</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou shall surely recover. However LORD has shown me that he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he settled his countenance steadfastly [upon him], until he was ashamed. And the man of God wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hazael said, Why do thou weep my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou will do to the sons of Israel: their strongholds thou will set on fire, and their young men thou will kill with the sword, and will dash</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, LORD has shown me that thou shall be king over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou would surely recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. And Hazael reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife. And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However LORD would not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his sons always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that encompassed him about, and the captains of the chariots. And the people fled to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, as did the house of Ahab, for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
