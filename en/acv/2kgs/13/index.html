He did not depart from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the anger of LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoahaz besought LORD, and LORD hearkened to him, for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>(And LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians, and the sons of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked therein. And the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he did not leave to Jehoahaz of the people except fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria.
