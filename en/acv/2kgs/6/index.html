And he answered, Go ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water. And he cried, and said, Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in there, and made the iron to float.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel, and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou not pass such a place, for the Syrians are coming down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of. And he saved himself there, not once nor twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled for this thing, and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one of his servants said, No, my lord, O king, but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that thou speak in thy bedchamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, Go and see where he is that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore he sent there horses, and chariots, and a great army. And they came by night, and encompassed the city about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an army with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he answered, Fear not, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see. And LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when they came into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men that they may see. And LORD opened their eyes, and they saw. And, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? Shall I smite them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he answered, Thou shall not smite them. Would thou smite those whom thou have taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? Set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he prepared great provision for them. And when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there was a great famine in Samaria. And, behold, they besieged it until a donkey's head was sold for eighty [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, If LORD does not help thee, from where shall I help thee? Out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the king said to her, What troubles thee? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give thy son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, Give thy son that we may eat him. And she has hid her son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was passing by upon the wall). And the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth inside upon his flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And [the king] sent a man from before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do ye see how this son of a murderer has sent to tak</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him, and he said, Behold, this evil is of LORD. Why should I wait for LORD any longer?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
