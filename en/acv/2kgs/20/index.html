And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says LORD, Set thy house in order, for thou shall die, and not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of LORD came to him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus says LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears. Behold, I will heal thee. On the third day thou shall go up to the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will add to thy days fifteen years. And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. And I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of LORD the third day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign to thee from LORD, that LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Isaiah the prophet cried to LORD, and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was no</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say, and from where did they come to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, the days come that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And of thy sons who shall issue from thee, whom thou shall beget, they shall take away. And they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of LORD which thou have spoken is good. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
