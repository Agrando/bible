And he did not do that which was right in the eyes of LORD his God, like David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. Yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom LORD cast out from before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war, and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath. And the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son. Come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king of Assyria hearkened to him. And the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried [the people of] it captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus. And king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the form of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Urijah the priest built an altar. According to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it until the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar. And the king drew near to the altar, and offered thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the brazen altar, which was before LORD, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of LORD, and put it on the north side of his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the king's burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the covered place for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry outside, he turned from the house of LORD, because of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
