He was also a mighty man of valor, [but he was] a leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden, and she waited on Naaman's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And she said to her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And a man went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden who is of the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter has come to thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee that thou may heal him of his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But consider, I pray you, and see ho</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have thou torn thy clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Is</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought he will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, would thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he says to thee, Wash, and be clean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then went he down, and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him. And he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, take a present from thy se</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said, As LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it, but he refused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of dirt, for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In this thing LORD pardon thy servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, LORD pardon thy serva</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As LORD lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. Give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of r</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house, and he let the men go, and they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, From where did thou come, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went nowhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him, Did not my heart go [with thee] when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and m</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cling to thee, and to thy seed forever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
