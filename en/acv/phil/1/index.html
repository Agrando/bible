So that ye may be tested by sunlight and not stumbling toward the day of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>having been filled with fruits of righteousness, through Jesus Christ, for glory and praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I want you to know, brothers, that the things in respect to me have come more for the advancement of the good-news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>in order for my bonds in Christ to became apparent in the whole Praetorium, and in all the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And more of the brothers in Lord have been convinced by my bonds to be much more bold to speak the word fearlessly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Actually some also preach the Christ because of envy and strife, and some also because of good-will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some indeed proclaim the Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to bring affliction to my bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But some from love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the good-news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then? Except in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice, but also I will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this will turn out to me for salvation (through your entreaty, and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my eager expectation and hope that I will be shamed in nothing. But with all boldness, now as always, Christ will also be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if to live in flesh, this is fruit of labor to me, then what I will choose I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I am constrained by the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, being far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having been convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and will continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So that your pride may abound in Christ Jesus in me because of my presence with you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only be citizens worthy of the good-news of the Christ, so that, whether having come and having seen you or being absent, I may hear things about you that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith o</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And not being frightened in anything by those who oppose, which is indeed a sign of destruction to them, but to you of salvation, and this from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because to you it was granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict such as ye saw in me, and now hear is in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
