And, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by, to whom he said, Such man, stay, turn aside. Sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come again out of the country of Moab, sells the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I thought to disclose it to thee, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou will redeem it, redeem it, but if thou will not redeem it, then tell me that I may know, for there is none</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Boaz said, That day thou buy the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself lest I mar my own inheritance. Take thou my right of redemption on thee, for I cannot redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: A man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor. And this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his plac</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. LORD make the woman that has come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel, and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, an</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And let thy house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which LORD shall give thee by this young woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be LORD, who has not left thee this day without a near kinsman. And let his name be famous in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he shall be to thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loves thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, has borne him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi.
