For greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the congregation may receive edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I benefit you, unless I would speak to you either in a revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophesying, or in doctrine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Likewise lifeless things that give a sound, whether flute or harp, if they give no distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For also if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So also ye, unless ye give understandable speech by the tongue, how will that which is spoken be known? For ye will be talking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Since there are perhaps, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without significance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore I know not the force of the voice, I will be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So also ye, since ye are zealots of spirits, seek so that ye may excel for the edification of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays, but my intellect is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is it therefore? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the intellect also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the intellect also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise if thou would bless with the spirit, how will the man who fills the place of the unlearned, say the Truly at thy thanksgiving, since he knows not what thou say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thou indeed express thanks well, but the other man is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank my God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet in an assembly I would rather speak five words with my intellect, so that I might also make others understand, than countless words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, become not children in your thoughts. Instead be childlike in wickedness, but in your thoughts become mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, In other tongues and in other lips I will speak to this people, and not even so will they hear me, says Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving. But prophesying is not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore the whole congregation comes together in the same place, and all speak in tongues, and unlearned or unbelieving men come in, will they not say that ye are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and some unbelieving or unlearned man comes in, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And so the secrets of his heart are made manifest. And so having fallen down on his face he will worship God, declaring that God is really among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What is it therefore, brothers? When ye come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any man speaks in a tongue, be according to two, or at the most three, and in succession. And let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silence in an assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And let two or three prophets speak, and let the other men pass judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if it should be revealed to another man who is seated, let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For ye can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn, and all may be encouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As in all the churches of the sanctified, let the women keep silent in the churches. For it is not permitted for them to speak, but to be subordinate, as the law also says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they want to learn anything, let them question their own husbands at home, for it is an ugly thing for women to speak in an assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or did the word of God come forth from you? Or did it come to you only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any man presumes to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge what I write to you, that they are commandments of Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore brothers, be zealous for prophesying, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
