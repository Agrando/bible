But not even yet are ye able,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>for ye are still carnal. For whereas among you is envy and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal and walk according to man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For while one may say, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who therefore is Paul and who is Apollos? But rather helpers through whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to each man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused growth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then neither is he who plants anything, nor he who waters, but God who causes growth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each man will receive his own payment according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are co-workmen of God. Ye are a tillage of God, an edifice of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master builder, I laid a foundation and another man is building on it. But let each man take heed how he is building on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For no man can lay another foundation besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if any man builds upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>each man's work will become manifest. For the day will make it known, because it is revealed by fire. And the fire will test each man's work of what kind it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man's work that he built on will remain, he will receive benefit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man's work will be burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know ye not that ye are a temple of God and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy this man, for the temple of God is holy, which ye are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let not one man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become foolish so that he may become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, He who catches the wise in their craftiness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again, Lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let not one man boast in men. For all things are yours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
