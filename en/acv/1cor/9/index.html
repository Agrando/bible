Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are ye not my work in Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you, for ye are the seal of my apostleship in Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My defense to those who examine me is this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have we no, not a right to eat and to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Have we no, not a right to lead about a sister wife, as also the other apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or have only I and Barnabas no right not to be occupied earning a living?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who ever enlists in an army at his own wage? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat from the fruit of it? Or who feeds a flock and does not eat from the milk of the flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do I say these things according to man, or does not the law also say these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is written in the law of Moses thou shall not muzzle an ox threshing grain. Is God concerned about oxen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>or does he speak altogether for our sake? For our sake, for it was written, He who plows ought to plow with hope, and he who threshes with his hope, with hope to share.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we sowed spiritual things to you, is it a great thing if we will reap your carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others are partakers of the right from you, are not we more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we cover all things, so that we may not give any hindrance to the good-news of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Know ye not that those being employed at the sacred things eat from the temple, and those who serve at the altar are partakers at the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And so the Lord commanded those who proclaim the good-news to live from the good-news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have used none of these things, and I did not write these things so that it should be done to me this way. For it is good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my boasting empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if I preach the good-news, it is not a source of pride for me, for an obligation is laid upon me. And woe is to me if I do not preach the good-news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward, but if involuntarily, I have been entrusted with a commission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then is my reward? That, while preaching the good-news, I may make the good-news of the Christ without charge, in order not to make full use of my right in the good-news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For although being free from all men, I made myself a servant to all, so that I might gain the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might gain Jews, to those under law, as under law, so that I might gain those under law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to those without law, as without law (not being without law to God, but within law to Christ), so that I might gain men without law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak I became as weak, so that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, so that by all means I might save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I do this for sake of the good-news, so that I might become a fellow participant of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know ye not that those who run in an arena, indeed all run, but one receives the prize? So run that ye may seize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And every man who strives for mastery exercises self-control in all things. Indeed therefore those men do it so that they might obtain a perishable crown, but we an imperishable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore run this way, not as aimlessly. I fight this way, not as flaying air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I give my body a black eye and subdue it, lest somehow having preached to others, I myself might become disqualified.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
