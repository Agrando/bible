And the rock was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>However with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were strewn in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But these things became our examples, for us not to be men who lust for evil things as those also lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Neither become ye idolaters as some of them, as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nor should we fornicate as some of them fornicated, and three thousand fell in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nor should we challenge the Christ as some of them also challenged, and were destroyed by the serpents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye should not grumble as some of them grumbled, and were destroyed by the destroyer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now all these things happened to those men for examples, and they were written for our admonition, to whom the ends of the ages came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore let him who seems to stand take heed lest he fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No temptation has taken you except is common to man. But God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted above what ye are able, but with the temptation will also make the way to escape, to enable you to endure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The cup of the blessing that we bless, is it not a participation of the blood of the Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation of the body of the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because we, the many, are one bread, one body, for we are all partakers of the one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look at Israel according to flesh. Those who eat the sacrifices, are they not partakers of the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What therefore do I say, that an idol is anything, or that a sacrifice to an idol is anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rather, that which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become partakers of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye cannot drink the cup of Lord, and the cup of demons. Ye cannot be partakers of a table of Lord, and of a table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things are permitted for me, but not all things are expedient. All things are permitted for me, but not all things are constructive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let not one man seek that of himself, but each man that of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Eat everything being sold in a meat market, inquiring of nothing because of the conscience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any of those unbelievers invites you, and ye want to go, eat everything being set before you, inquiring of nothing because of the conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if any man say to you, This is a sacrifice to an idol, do not eat for the sake of that man who informed, and the conscience, for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I say conscience, not the one of himself, but the one of the other man. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I maligned about which I express thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore whether ye eat, or drink, or anything ye do, do all to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Become ye inoffensive both to Jews and to Greeks, and to the church of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>just as I also strive to please in all things for all men, not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many, so that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
