But if it is an ugly thing for a woman to shear herself or be shaven, she should be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, being an image and glory of God, but woman is a glory of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For man is not from woman, but woman from man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For also man was not created for the woman, but woman for the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because of this the woman ought to have authority over her head, because of the heavenly agents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man is through the woman. But all things are from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge ye among yourselves, is it proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Or does not nature itself teach you that if a man actually wears long hair it is a disgrace to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a woman wears long hair, it is a glory to her, because her hair has been given for a cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if any man appears to be a lover of strife, we have no such custom, nor the congregations of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now in this that is commanded, I do not praise you, because ye do not assemble for the better but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For indeed first, when ye come together in a congregation, I hear divisions are present among you, and I partly believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must also be factions among you, so that the genuine may become apparent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When therefore ye come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For each man proceeds to eat his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For have ye no houses to eat and to drink in? Or do ye disparage the church of God, and humiliate those not having? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and having expressed thanks, he broke in pieces, and said, Take ye, eat, this is my body broken for you. This do ye for my memorial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise also the cup after the supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. This do, as often as ye drink it, for my memorial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore whoever may eat this bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily of the Lord, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and let him so eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because of this many are weak and sickly among you, and a considerable sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we were discerning ourselves we would not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged by Lord, we are chastened so that we may not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, my brothers, when ye come together to eat, await each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if any man is hungry, let him eat at home so that ye may not come together for condemnation. And the rest I will set in order as soon as I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
