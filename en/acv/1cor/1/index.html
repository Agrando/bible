That each of you actually say, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were ye immersed in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I immersed none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest some man should say that I immersed in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I also immersed the household of Stephanas. Besides, I know not whether I immersed any other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ sent me not to immerse, but to preach the good-news, not in wisdom of speech lest the cross of Christ would be emptied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the message of the cross is of course, foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is a power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will frustrate the understanding of those of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is a wise man? Where is a scholar? Where is a researcher of this age? Did not God make foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since in the wisdom of God the world did not know God through its wisdom, it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And because Jews demand a sign and Greeks search for wisdom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we proclaim Christ crucified, truly to Jews a stumbling-block and to Gentiles foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to them, to the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For notice your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many eminent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God chose the foolish things of the world, so that he might humiliate the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world, so that he might humiliate the powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God chose the common things of the world, and the disdained things, and the things that are not, so that he might make useless the things that are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that no flesh may boast before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But ye are his, in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that, just as it is written, He who boasts, let him boast in Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
