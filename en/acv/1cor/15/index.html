And his grace for me did not become empty, but I labored more abundantly than them all, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore whether I or those men, so we proclaim, and so ye believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if Christ is proclaimed that he has risen from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if Christ has not risen, then our preaching is empty, and your faith is also empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And also we are found FALSE witnesses of God, because we witnessed according to God that he raised up the Christ, whom he did not raise up, if therefore the dead are really not raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain. Ye are still in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then also those who slept in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If we are men who have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men more miserable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruit of those who are asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since death is because of a man, the resurrection of the dead is also because of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as by Adam all die, so also by Christ all will be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But each in his own order. Christ the first fruit, then those of Christ at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Afterwards the end, when he delivers up the kingdom to the God and Father, when he will abolishes all rule, and all authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he must reign until he will put all his enemies under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy abolished is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For he subordinated all things under his feet. But when he says that all things have been subordinated, it is clear that he who subordinated all things under him, is excepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when all things are made subordinate to him, then the Son himself will also be made subordinate to him who subordinated all things to him, so that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise what will they do who are immersed for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why then are they immersed for the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And we, why are we in peril every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By the pride that belongs to you, that I keep in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If in respect to men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what is the benefit to me if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be not led astray. Evil associations corrupt good habits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Sober up rightly, and do not sin, for some have ignorance of God. I speak shame about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some man will say, How are the dead raised, and with what kind of body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou foolish man, what thou sow is not made alive unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what thou sow, thou do not sow the body that it will become, but a bare grain, if it may happen of wheat, or of some other kind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives it a body as he wills, and to each of the seeds its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh, but one of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies (but the glory of the heavenly is different, and the glory of the earthly is different),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>another glory is of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in the perishable, it is raised in imperishability.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And so it is written, The first man Adam developed into a living soul. The last Adam a life giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Nevertheless the spiritual is not first, but the natural, then the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man was of the earth, earthly. The second man is the Lord from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As is the earthly, such also are the earthly. And as is the heavenly, such also are the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And just as we have worn the form of the earthly, we will also wear the form of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now this I affirm, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit imperishability.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will actually not all sleep, but we will all be transformed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For it will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be transformed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this perishable must put on imperishability, and this mortal put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But when this perishable will have put on imperishability, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come to pass the saying that is written, Death was swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks is to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brothers, become ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not empty in Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
