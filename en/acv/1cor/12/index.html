If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has placed the parts, each one of them, in the body just as he intended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they were all one part, where would be the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now of course there are many body-parts, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee, nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Instead, much more the parts of the body that seem to be more feeble are necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those things of the body presumed to be without esteem, we place around these more abundant worth. And our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whereas our presentable parts have no need. Instead, God united the body together, having given more abundant worth to the part that lacks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>so that there would be no schisms in the body, but that the parts would have the same care for each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one part suffers, all the parts suffer together, or one part is honored, all the parts rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now ye are the body of Christ, and body-parts individually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And in the church God has placed men who are first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all do miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But be zealous for the better gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
