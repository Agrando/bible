For if they knew, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But as it is written, What an eye has not seen, and an ear has not heard, and have not arisen in a heart of a man, are things that God prepared for those who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But God disclosed it to us through his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For what man knows the things of the man, except the spirit of the man in him? And so nobody knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the spirit from God, so that we might know the things graciously given to us by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Which things also we speak, not in things learned from mankind, in words of wisdom, but in things learned from Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is unable to understand because they are evaluated spiritually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But truly the spiritual man evaluates all things, but he himself is evaluated by none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For who has known the mind of Lord that he will stand with him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
