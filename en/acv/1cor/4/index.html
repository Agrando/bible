Yet neither do I appraise myself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for I know nothing on myself. Yet I have not been made righteous in this, but he who appraises me is Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore do not judge anything before time, until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make public the deliberations of the hearts. And then praise will come to each man from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now these things, brothers, I applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us ye might learn not to think above that which is written, so that ye may not be puffed up, one over the one against the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who makes thee different? And what have thou that thou did not receive? And also if thou received it, why do thou boast as not having received it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Already ye are filled. Already ye have become rich. Ye reigned without us, and O that ye did indeed reign, so that we also might reign with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think God has exhibited us the apostles least, as men sentenced to die, because we became a spectacle to the world, both to heavenly agents and to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are foolish for the sake of Christ, but ye are wise in Christ. We are weak, but ye are strong. Ye are esteemed, but we are disreputable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As far as the present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are ill clothed, and are treated roughly, and are homeless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And we toil, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>being slandered, we entreat. We became as trash of the world, an offscouring of all things, until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I do not write these things shaming you, but I warn you as my beloved children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For though ye have countless instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I begot you through the good-news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I beseech you therefore, become followers of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of this I sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as of me not coming to you, some men are puffed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord should will, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What do ye want? Should I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
