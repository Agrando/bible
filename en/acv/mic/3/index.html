Is it not for you to know justice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ye who hate the good, and love the evil, who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then they shall cry to LORD, but he will not answer them. Yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says LORD concerning the prophets who make my people to err, who bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace. And he who does not put into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore it shall be night to you, that ye shall have no vision. And it shall be dark to you, that ye shall not divine. And the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded. Yea, they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice, and pervert all equity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The heads of it judge for a bribe, and the priests of it teach for a wage, and the prophets of it divine for money.
