When the morning is light they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they covet fields, and seize them, and houses, and take them away. And they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore thus says LORD: Behold, I devise an evil against this family, from which ye shall not remove your necks, nor shall ye walk haughtily, for it is an evil time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In that day they shall take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation.
