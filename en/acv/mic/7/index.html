For I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage. There is no cluster to eat. My soul desires the first ripe fig.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The devout man has perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men. They all lay in wait for blood. They hunt every man his brother with a net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently. The ruler asks, and the judge [is ready] for a bribe. And the great man, he utters the evil desire of his soul. Thus they weave it together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The best of them is as a brier. The most upright is [worse] than a thorn hedge. The day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, has come. Now shall be their perplexity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust ye not in a neighbor. Put ye not confidence in a friend. Keep the doors of thy mouth from her who lays in thy bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the son dishonors the father. The daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man's enemies are the men of his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But as for me, I will look to LORD. I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Rejoice not against me, O my enemy. When I fall, I shall arise. When I sit in darkness, LORD will be a light to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will bear the indignation of LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me. He will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall behold his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said to me, Where is LORD thy God? My eyes shall see [my desire] upon her. Now she shall be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A day for building thy walls! In that day the decree shall be far removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day they shall come to thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet the land shall be desolate because of those who dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily in the forest in the midst of Carmel. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt I will show marvelous things to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might. They shall lay their hand upon their mouth. Their ears shall be deaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They shall lick the dust like a serpent. Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places. They shall come with fear to LORD our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who is a God like to thee, who pardons iniquity, and passes over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in loving kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will again have compassion upon us. He will tread our iniquities under foot, and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou will perform the truth to Jacob, [and] the loving kindness to Abraham, which thou have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
