I cry out to thee of violence, and thou will not save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Why do thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? For destruction and violence are before me, and there is strife, and contention rises up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore the law is slacked, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked man surrounds the righteous man, therefore justice goes forth perverted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold ye scoffers (LXX/NT), and look, and wonder marvelously. For I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, who march through the breadth of the earth to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are fearful and dreadful. Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. And their horsemen press proudly on. Yea, their horsemen come from far. They fly as an eagle that hastens to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They come all of them for violence. The set of their faces is forwards, and they gather captives as the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, he scoffs at kings, and rulers are a derision to him. He derides every stronghold, for he heaps up dust, and takes it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he shall sweep by [as] a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty; he whose might is his god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are not thou from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, thou have ordained him for judgment, and thou, O Rock, have established him for correction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou who are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and who cannot look on perverseness, why do thou look upon those who deal treacherously, and hold thy peace when the wicked man swallows up the man who is more righteous than he,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and makes men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He takes all of them up with the hook. He catches them in his net, and gathers them in his drag. Therefore he rejoices and is glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his drag, because by them his portion is fat, and his food plentiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall he therefore empty his net, and not spare to kill the nations continually?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
