Though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come. It will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright in him. (But the righteous man shall live by his faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous.) [He is] a haughty man, who does not keep at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathers to him all nations, and heaps to him all peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him who increases that which is not his (how long?) and who loads himself with pledges!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee. And thou shall be for booty to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because thou have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou have devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, is it not of LORD of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, who adds thy venom, and also makes him drunken, that thou may look on their nakedness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou are filled with shame, and not glory. Drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised. The cup of LORD's right hand shall come around to thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee and the plunder of the beasts ([which] made them afraid), because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What profits the graven image, that the maker of it has engraved it, the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make dumb idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake, to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But LORD is in his holy temple. Let all the earth keep silence before him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
