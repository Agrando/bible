And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah. But the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, because he was the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also various of the rulers of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife. And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that encompassed him around, and the captains of the chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand because he had forsaken LORD, the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says LORD, the God of David thy father, Because thou have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like the house of Ahab did, and also have slain thy brothers of thy father's house who were better than thy</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>, behold, LORD will smite thy people with a great plague, and thy sons, and thy wives, and all thy substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou shall have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives, so that there has not been left a son to him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after all this LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out because of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. And his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. And he departed without being wanted. And they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
