And his mother's name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he begot sons and daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather money from all Israel to repair the house of your God from year to year. And see that ye hasten the matter. However t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why have thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of LORD, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God, and also all the dedicated things of the house of LORD they bestowed upon the Baalim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the rulers and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was so, that, at what [ever] time the chest was brought to the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the ch</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of LORD. And they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the workmen labored, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, from which were made vessels for the house of LORD, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold a</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was a hundred and thirty years old when he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now after the death of Jehoiada the rulers of Judah came, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they forsook the house of LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again to LORD. And they testified against them, but they would not give ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest. And he stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God, Why do ye transgress the commandments of LORD, so that ye cannot prosper? Because ye have for</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. And when he died, he said, LORD look upon it, and require it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him. And they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the rulers of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men. And LORD delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken LORD, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they were departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died. And they buried him in the city of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And these are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens [laid] upon him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
