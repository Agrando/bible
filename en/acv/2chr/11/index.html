Return every man to his house. For this thing is of me. So they hearkened to the words of LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in every city [he put] shields and spears, and made them exceedingly strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem. For Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he appointed priests for him for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And after them, such as set their hearts to seek LORD, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem out of all the tribes of Israel to sacrifice to LORD, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years. For they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she bore sons for him: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom. And she bore for him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines. For he took eighteen wives, and thirty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and thirty daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the ruler among his brothers. For [he intended] to make him king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he dealt wisely, and dispersed all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. And he gave them provisions in abundance. And he sought [for them] many wives.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
