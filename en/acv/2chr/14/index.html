And Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of LORD his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and commanded Judah to seek LORD, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images. And the kingdom was quiet before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he built fortified cities in Judah. For the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because LORD had given him rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought LORD our God. We have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand, and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand.

And there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves. For they were destroyed before LORD, and before his army. And they carried away very m</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar. For the fear of LORD came upon them. And they despoiled all the cities. For there was much spoil in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They also smote the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
