And he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he built altars in the house of LORD, of which LORD said, In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He also made his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. And he practiced augury, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with psychics, and with wizards. He wrought much evil in the sight</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he set the graven image of the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances [give</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than the nations did whom LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people, but they gave no heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he was in distress, he besought LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he prayed to him. And he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that LORD he was God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate. And he encompassed Ophel around [with it], and raised it up to a very great height. And he</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he built up the altar of LORD, and offered on it sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve LORD, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of LORD, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also his prayer, and how [God] was entreated by him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, as did Manasseh his father. And Amon sacrificed to all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he did not humble himself before LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself, but this same Amon trespassed more and more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon. And the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
