And he did not do that which was right in the eyes of LORD like David his father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also made molten images for the Baalim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom LORD cast out before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. And they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king o</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men, because they had forsaken LORD, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a prophet of LORD was there, whose name was Oded. And he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your han</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now ye propose to keep under the sons of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen to you. Are there not even with you trespasses of your own against LORD your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives that ye have taken captive of your brothers. For the fierce wrath of LORD is upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then certain of the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives here. For ye propose that which will bring upon us a trespass against LORD, to add to our sins and to our trespass. For our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against I</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the rulers and all the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them, and dressed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carrie</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns of it, and Timnah with the towns of it, also Gimzo and the towns</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed severely against LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but did not strengthen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of LORD, and out of the house of the king and of the rulers, and gave it to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against LORD, this same king Ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him.

For they did not bring him into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
