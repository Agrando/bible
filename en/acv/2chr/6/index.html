And all the assembly of Israel stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said, Blessed be LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in that my name might be there. Neither did I choose any man to be ruler over my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I have chosen Jerusalem that my name might be there. And have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of LORD, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou did well that it was in thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nevertheless thou shall not build the house, but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And LORD has performed his word that he spoke. For I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of LORD, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there I have set the ark in which is the covenant of LORD, which he made with the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he stood before the altar of LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court.

Yea, thou spoke with thy mouth, and have fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou have promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons take heed to th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spoke to thy servant David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. How much less this house which I have built!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place of which thou have said that thou would put thy name there, to hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place.
