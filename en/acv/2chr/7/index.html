And the glory of LORD filled the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the priests could not enter into the house of LORD, because the glory of LORD filled LORD's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the sons of Israel looked on when the fire came down, and the glory of LORD was upon the house. And they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks to LORD, [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priests stood according to their offices, also the Levites with instruments of music of LORD, which David the king had made to give thanks to LORD (for his loving kindness [is] forever) when David praised by their ministry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of LORD. For there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to rece</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly.
