For they had not kept it in great numbers in</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his rulers throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye sons of Israel, turn again to LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And be ye not like your fathers, and like your brothers, who trespassed against LORD, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve LORD your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For if ye turn again to LORD, your brothers and your sons shall find compassion before those who led them captive, and shall come again into this land. For LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face fro</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun. But they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Also the hand of God came upon Judah to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the rulers by the word of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood [which they received] from the hand of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves. Therefore the Levites had charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pa</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who sets his heart to seek God, LORD, the God of his fathers, though [he be] not according to the purification of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. And the Levites and the priests praised LORD day by day, with loud instruments to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding [in the service] of LORD. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to LORD, th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days. And they kept [those] seven days with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep. And the rulers gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep. And a great number of priests sanctified th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem. For since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people. And their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
