And they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built. There shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders. Now serve LORD your Go</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And prepare yourselves after your fathers' houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brothers the sons of the people, and the portion of a fathers' house of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of LORD by Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Josiah gave to the sons of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and [also] three thousand bullocks; these were of the king'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his rulers gave for a freewill-offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hu</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand [small cattle], and five hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood] by their hand, and the Levites skinned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they removed the burnt-offerings that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the sons of the people, to offer to LORD as it is written in the book of Moses. And so they did with the oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance. And the holy offerings they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the sons of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busy] in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night.
