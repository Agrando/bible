And afterward the priest shall go in to see the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and he shall look on the disease. And, behold, if the disease is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance of it is lower than the wall [surface],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look. And, behold, if the disease be spread in the walls of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the disease is, and cast them into an unclean place outside the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, outside the city into an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones. And he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if the disease comes again, and breaks out in the house, after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>then the priest shall come in and look. And, behold, if the disease be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber of it, and all the mortar of the house, and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Moreover he who goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he who lays in the house shall wash his clothes. And he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the disease is healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he shall take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop to cleanse the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field.

This is the law of a leprous disease.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
