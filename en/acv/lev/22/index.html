I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Say to them, Whoever he is of all your seed throughout your generations, that approaches to the holy things, which the sons of Israel hallow to LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me. I am</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whatever man of the seed of Aaron being a man with a leprous disease, or has an issue, he shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from h</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>or whoever touches any creeping thing, by which he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>the soul that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening.

I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die in it if they profane it.
