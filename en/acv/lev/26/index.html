Neither shall ye rear up for you a graven image, or a pillar. Neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it. For I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time, and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lay down, and none shall make you afraid. And I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, nor shall the sword go through your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye shall eat old storage long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will set my tabernacle among you, and my soul shall not abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen. And I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye will not hearken to me, and will not do all these commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away. And ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies. Those who hate you shall rule over you, and ye shall flee when no man pursues you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if for these things ye will not yet hearken to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will break the pride of your power. And I will make your sky as iron, and your earth as brass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its increase, nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if ye walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your sons, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, and your ways shall become desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if by these things ye will not be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then I also will walk contrary to you, and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword upon you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant, and ye shall be gathered together within your cities. And I will send the pestilence among you, and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enem</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight, and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if for all this ye will not hearken to me, but walk contrary to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then I will walk contrary to you in wrath, and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters ye shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you, and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths, as long as it lays desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land, even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lays desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your Sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as for those who are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as a man flees from the sword, and they shall fall w</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when no man pursues. And ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands, and also in the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its Sabbaths while it lays desolate without them. And they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity, because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abh</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them, for I am LORD their God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>but for their sakes I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which LORD made between him and the sons of Israel on mount Sinai by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
