It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He shall keep the lamps upon the pure candlestick in order before LORD continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And thou shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it. Two tenth parts [of an ephah] shall be in one cake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou shall set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou shall put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before LORD continually. It is on the behalf of the sons of Israel, an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be for Aaron and his sons. And they shall eat it in a holy place, for it is most holy to him of the offerings of LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel. And the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed. And they brought him to Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they put him in ward, that it might be declared to them at the mouth of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Bring forth him who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he who blasphemes the name of LORD, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. As well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he who smites any man mortally shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he who smites a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if a man causes a blemish in his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>injury for injury, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he who kills a beast shall make it good. And he who kills a man shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye shall have one manner of law, as for the sojourner, as for the home-born, for I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought forth him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the sons of Israel did as LORD commanded Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
