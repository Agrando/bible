The people of the land shall stone h</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives of his seed to Molech, and do not put him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all who play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the soul that turns to those who have familiar spirits, and to the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and become ye holy, for I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them. I am LORD who sanctifies you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the man who commits adultery with another man's wife, even he who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the man who lays with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness. Both of them shall surely be put to death, their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a man lays with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have wrought perversion. Their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if a man lays with a man, as with a woman, both of them have committed abomination. They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man takes a wife and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burnt with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if a man lays with a beast, he shall surely be put to death, and ye shall kill the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a woman approaches to any beast, and lays down with it, thou shall kill the woman and the beast. They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful thing, and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if a man shall lay with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood. And both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister, for he has made naked his near kin. They shall bear their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if a man shall lay with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness. They shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is impurity. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them, that the land, where I bring you to dwell in it, not vomit you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I cast out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I have said to you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean. And ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And ye shall be holy to me, for I, LORD, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A man or also a woman who has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death. They shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
