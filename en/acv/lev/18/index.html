I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>None of you shall approach to any who are near of kin to him, to uncover nakedness.
