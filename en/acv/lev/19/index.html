And ye shall keep my Sabbaths. I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Turn ye not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods. I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to LORD, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow. And if any remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination. It shall not be accepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of LORD, and that soul shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shall not wholly reap the corners of thy field, nor shall thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shall not glean thy vineyard, nor shall thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard. Thou shall leave them for the poor man and for the sojourner. I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ye shall not steal, nor shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of thy God. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shall not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but thou shall fear thy God. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. Thou shall not respect the person of the poor man, nor honor the person of the mighty man, but thou shall judge thy neighbor in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shall not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people, neither shall thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shall not hate thy brother in thy heart. Thou shall surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of thy people, but thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shall not let thy cattle engender with a diverse kind. Thou shall not sow thy field with two kinds of seed, neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And whoever lays carnally with a woman, who is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her, they shall be punished. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he shall bring his trespass-offering to LORD, to the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before LORD for his sin which he has sinned. And the sin which he has sinned shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit of it as their uncircumcision. Three years they shall be as uncircumcised to you; it shall not be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in the fourth year all the fruit of it shall be holy, for giving praise to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fifth year ye shall eat of the fruit of it, that it may yield to you the increase of it. I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ye shall not eat anything with the blood. Neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practice augury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, nor shall thou mar the corners of thy beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Do not profane thy daughter, to make her a harlot, lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do not turn to those who have familiar spirits, nor to the wizards. Do not seek them out, to be defiled by them. I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thou shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and thou shall fear thy God. I am LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a stranger sojourns with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The stranger that sojourns with you shall be to you as the home-born among you, and thou shall love him as thyself, for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Ye shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin. I am LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them. I am LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
