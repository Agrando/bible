Thou shall neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That which grows of itself of thy harvest thou shall not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shall not gather. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you: for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourns with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, all the increase of it shall be for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou shall number seven Sabbaths of years to thee, seven times seven years, and there shall be to thee the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then thou shall send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. In the day of atonement ye shall send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants of it. It shall be a jubilee to you, and ye shall return every man to his possession, and ye shall return every man to his famil</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. Ye shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather in it of the undressed vines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. Ye shall eat the increase of it out of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if thou sell anything to thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not wrong each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shall buy of thy neighbor, [and] according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>According to the multitude of the years thou shall increase the price of it, and according to the fewness of the years thou shall diminish the price of it, for the number of the crops he sells to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And ye shall not wrong each other, but thou shall fear thy God, for I am LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them, and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell in safety in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old storage, until the ninth year. Until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old storage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If thy brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possession, then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, and shall redeem that which his brother has sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes rich and finds sufficient to redeem it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then let him reckon the years of the sale of it, and restore the excess to the man to whom he sold it, and he shall return to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then that which he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the year of jubilee. And in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if a man sells a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not go out in the jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country. They may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a man purchases from the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee. For the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if thy brother becomes poor, and his hand fails with thee, then thou shall uphold him; he shall live with thee [as] a stranger and a sojourner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Take thou no interest from him or increase, but fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou shall not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy food for profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I am LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, [and] to be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And if thy brother becomes poor with thee, and sells himself to thee, thou shall not make him to serve as a bondman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He shall be with thee as a hired servant, and as a sojourner. He shall serve with thee to the year of jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he shall go out from thee, he and his sons with him, and shall return to his own family. And he shall return to the possession of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as bondmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou shall not rule over him with rigor, but shall fear thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shall have, from the nations that are round about you, ye shall buy bondmen and bondmaids from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover of the sons of the strangers who sojourn among you, ye shall buy from them, and from their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land, and they shall be your possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And ye shall make them an inheritance for your sons after you, to hold for a possession. Ye shall take them your bondmen forever, but over your brothers the sons of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if a stranger or sojourner with thee becomes rich, and thy brother becomes poor beside him, and sells himself to the stranger [or] sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he may be redeemed after he is sold. One of his brothers may redeem him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him. Or any who is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him. Or if he becomes rich, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee. And the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years. He shall be with him according to the time of a hire</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there be yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him. He shall give back the price of his redemption according to his years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He shall be with him as a servant hired year by year. He shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if he is not redeemed by these [means], then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his sons with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For the sons of Israel are servants to me. They are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. I am LORD your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
