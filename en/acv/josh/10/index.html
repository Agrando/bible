Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill-country are gathered</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not, for I have delivered them into thy hands. There shall not a man of them stand before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, [for] he went up from Gilgal all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And LORD discomfited them before Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died. More died with the hailstones than those whom the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Joshua spoke to LORD in the day when LORD delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel. And he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hastened not to go down about a whole</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that LORD hearkened to the voice of a man, for LORD fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but stay ye not. Pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them. Do not allow them to enter into their cities, for LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel had made an end of killing them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No man moved his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings to me out of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. A</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed. Be strong and of good courage, for thus shall LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it. He utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were in it. He left none remaining, and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had do</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And LORD delivered it also, and the king of it, into the hand of Israel. And he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it. He left none remaining in it, and he did to the king of it as he had done to th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel. And he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon. And they encamped against it, and fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword. And all the souls that were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron. And they fought against it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it, and all the cities of it, and all the souls that were in it. He left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but he utterly destroye</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he took it, and the king of it, and all the cities of it. And they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were in it. He left none remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as LORD, the God of Israel, commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And all these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
