Thus shall thou do six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. And the seventh day ye shall encompass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout.

And the ark of the covenant of LORD followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rearward went behind the ark, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then ye shall shout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he caused the ark of LORD to encompass the city, going around it once. And they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of LORD went on continually, and blew the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rearward came behind the ark of LORD, [the priests] blow</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the second day they encompassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and encompassed the city according to the same manner seven times. Only on that day they encompassed the city seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout, for LORD has given you the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the city shall be set apart, even it and all that is in it, to LORD. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is set apart, lest when ye have set it apart, ye take from what is set apart. So ye would make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to LORD. They shall come into the treasury of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew the trumpets. And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up in</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out there the woman, and all that she has, as ye swore to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the young men, the spies, went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her kindred, and they set them outside the camp of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had. And she dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before LORD who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his first-born he shall lay the foundation of it, and with the loss of his younges</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
