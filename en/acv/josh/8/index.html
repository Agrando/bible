Take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And thou shall do to Ai and her king as thou did to Jericho and her king. Only the spoil of it, and the cattle of it, ye shall take for a prey to yourselves. Set thee an ambush for the city behind it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lay in ambush against the city, behind the city. Go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first. So we will flee before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city, for LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire. According to the word of LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua sent them forth, and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai, but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they set the people, even all the army that was on the north of the city, and their ambushment that were on the west of the city, and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hastened and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah, but he did not know</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them, and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. And they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai, for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it. And they hastened and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. And the people who fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursu</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the others came forth out of the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. And they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they took the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all who fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of LORD which he commanded Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening. And at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Joshua built an altar to LORD, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>as Moses the servant of LORD commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron. And they offered burnt-offerings on it to LORD, and s</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of LORD, as well the sojourner as the home born, half</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who were among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
