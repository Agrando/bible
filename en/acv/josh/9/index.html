And Joshua said to them, Who are ye, and from where do ye come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to him, From a very far country. Thy servants have come because of the name of LORD thy God, for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants, and now make ye a covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you, but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these wine-skins, which we filled, were new, and, behold, they are torn. And these our garments and our shoes have become old by reason of the very long journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the men took of their provision, and did not ask counsel at the mouth of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live, and the rulers of the congregation swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Israel did not smite them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by LORD, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But all the rulers said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by LORD, the God of Israel, now therefore we may not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This we will do to them, and let them live, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rulers said to them, Let them live. So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the rulers had spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you, when ye dwell among us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be bondmen of you, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore w</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, behold, we are in thy hand. As it seems good and right to thee to do to us, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, that they did not kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of LORD to this day in the place which he should choose.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
