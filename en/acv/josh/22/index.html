And it will be, seeing ye rebel today against LORD, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass ye over to the land of the possession of LORD, in which LORD's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us, but do not rebel against LORD, nor rebel against us, in b</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in what was set apart, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Mighty One, God, LORD, the Mighty One, God, LORD, he knows, and Israel he shall know, if it is in rebellion, or if in trespass against LORD (do not save us this day),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that we have built us an altar to turn away from following LORD, or if to offer burnt-offering or meal-offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings on it, let LORD himself require it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this, from purpose, saying, In time to come your sons might speak to our sons, saying, What have ye to do with LORD, the God of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye sons of Reuben and sons of Gad. Ye have no portion in LORD. So your sons might make our sons cease from fearing LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of LORD before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings, that your sons may n</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore we said, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice, but it is</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Far be it from us that we should rebel against LORD, and turn away this day from following LORD, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of LORD our God that is before his tabern</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Phinehas the priest, and the rulers of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Manasseh, This day we know that LORD is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the rulers, returned from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought them word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the thing pleased the sons of Israel. And the sons of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar [Ed]. For, [they said], it is a witness between us that LORD is God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
