And they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver them up all slain before Israel. Thou shall hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. And they smote them until they left them none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua did to them as LORD bade him. He hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king of it with the sword, for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they smote all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was none left that breathed, and he burnt Hazor with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of LORD commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except only Hazor. Joshua burned that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the sons of Israel took for a prey to themselves, but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, neither did they leave any who breathed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As LORD commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>from mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon.

They took all in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it was of LORD to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them as LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod some remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that LORD spoke to Moses.
