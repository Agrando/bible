And, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot strong grizzled horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then I answered and said to the [heavenly] agent who talked with me, What are these, my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the [heavenly] agent answered and said to me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before LORD of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[The chariot] in which are the black horses goes forth toward the north country, and the white went forth after them, and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the strong ones went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth.
