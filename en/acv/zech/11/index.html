Wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest has come down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A voice of the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is destroyed. A voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus said LORD my God: Feed the flock of slaughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>whose possessors kill them, and hold themselves not guilty. And those who sell them say, Blessed be LORD, for I am rich, and their own shepherds pity them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says LORD. But, lo, I will deliver the men each one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king. And they shall smite the land, and I will not deliver them out of the</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I fed the flock of slaughter, truly the poor of the flock. And I took to me two staves, the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands, and I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I cut off the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, I will not feed you. That which dies, let it die, and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off, and let those who are left eat each one the flesh of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was broken in that day, and thus the poor of the flock who gave heed to me knew that it was the word of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I said to them, If ye think good, give me my wage, and if not, forbear.
