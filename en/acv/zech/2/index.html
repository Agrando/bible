And, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then I said, Where do thou go? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem. To see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And, behold, the [heavenly] agent who talked with me went forth. And another [heavenly] agent went out to meet him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and cattle therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For I, says LORD, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says LORD.
