And their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of LORD. And six thousand were officers and judges,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and four thousand were porters, and four thousand praised LORD with the instruments which I made, [David said], to praise therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
