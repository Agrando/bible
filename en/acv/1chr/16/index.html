And they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of LORD, and to celebrate and to thank and praise LORD, the God of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps, and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to LORD by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O give thanks to LORD. Call upon his name. Make known his doings among the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Talk ye of all his marvelous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek LORD rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Seek ye LORD and his strength. Seek his face evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He is LORD our God. His judgments are in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Remember his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[the covenant] which he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>saying, To thee I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>when ye were but a few men in number, yea, very few, and sojourners in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and they went about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[Saying], Touch not my anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sing to LORD, all the earth. Show forth his salvation from day to day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For great is LORD, and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For all the gods of the peoples are idols. But LORD made the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and gladness are in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ascribe to LORD, ye kindred of the peoples. Ascribe to LORD glory and strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Ascribe to LORD the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come before him. Worship LORD in holy array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Tremble before him, all the earth. The world also is established that it cannot be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. And let them say among the nations, LORD reigns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it. Let the field exult, and all that is therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O give thanks to LORD, for he is good, for his loving kindness [is] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation. And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Blessed be LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of LORD, Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and Obed-edom with their sixty-eight brothers. And Obed-edom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah [were] to be porters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>to offer burnt-offerings to LORD upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of LORD, which he commanded to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to LORD because his loving kindness [is] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And with them Heman and Jeduthun [with] trumpets and cymbals for those who should sound aloud, and [with] instruments for the songs of God, and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And all the people departed every man to his house. And David returned to bless his house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
