And I will make thee a name like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. Neither shall the sons of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that LORD will build for thee a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons. And I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build for me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. And I will not take my loving kindness away from him as I took it from him who was before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then David the king went in, and sat before LORD. And he said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that thou have brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God. But thou have spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What can David [say] yet more to thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? For thou know thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, thou have wrought all this greatness, to make known all [these] great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what one nation on the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before thy people whom thou redeemed out of E</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For thy people Israel thou made thine own people forever. And thou, LORD, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now, O LORD, let the word that thou have spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as thou have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let thy name be established and magnified forever, saying, LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel, and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For thou, O my God, have revealed to thy servant that thou will build him a house. Therefore thy servant has found [in his heart] to pray before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, O LORD, thou are God, and have promised this good thing to thy servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and now it has pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O LORD, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
