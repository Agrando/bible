So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the rulers of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, Do thou think that David honors thy father, in that he has sent comforters to thee? Have not his servants come to thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they came and informed David about the men. And he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Remain at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out o</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they hired for them thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city. And the kings that came were by themselves in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind, he chose from all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the rest of the company he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they put themselves in array against the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shall help me, but if the sons of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be of good courage, and let us act the man for our people, and for the cities of our God. And LORD do that which seems good to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Joab and the company that were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle, and they fled before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city.

And he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with h</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Syrians fled before Israel. And David killed of the Syrians [the men of] seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him, neither would the Syrians help the sons of Ammon any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
