For if by the trespass of the one man the many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for the many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the gift is not as through one man who sinned, for indeed the judgment from one man was for condemnation, but the gift from many offenses is for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if, by the offense of the one man, death reigned through the one man, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then, as through an offense of one man was for condemnation for all men, so also through a righteousness of one man was for justification of life for all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as through the one man's disobedience the many were led sinful, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be led righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the law entered so that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace was more abundant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that, as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign, through righteousness, for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
