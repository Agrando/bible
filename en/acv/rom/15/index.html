In him Gentiles will hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, for ye to abound in hope in the power of Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I also myself am persuaded about you, my brothers, that ye yourselves are also full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I wrote more boldly to you, brothers, in part, as reminding you because of the grace that was given to me by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for me to be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, serving the good-news of God like a priest, so that the offering up of the Gentiles might become acceptable, being sanctified in Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have therefore a boast in Christ Jesus in things toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not dare to speak anything of which Christ did not accomplish through me for the obedience of Gentiles, by word and work,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of a spirit of God, so that for me, from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum, to fully preach the good-news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And thus having aspired to proclaim the good-news not where Christ was already named, so that I would not build upon a foundation belonging to another man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but, as it is written, They will see to whom it was not reported about him, and they will understand who have not heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore also, I was delayed these many times coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now, having no more place in these regions, and having a great desire from many years to come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whenever I go to Spain I will come to you. For I hope to see you while passing through, and there to be helped on the way by you, if first I may be partly satisfied from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I am going to Jerusalem serving the sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a certain participation for the poor of the sanctified at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they were pleased. And they are debtors of them, for if the gentiles were partakers in their spiritual things, they are obligated also to serve them in the carnal things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Having therefore completed this, and having sealed this fruit for them, I will depart by you to Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the good-news of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I beseech you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive with me in prayers to God for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may become acceptable to the sanctified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>so that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and be rested with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the God of peace is with you all. Truly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
