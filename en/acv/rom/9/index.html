Truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it is not as that the word of God has failed. For all those from Israel, these are not Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>nor, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children, rather, In Isaac a seed will be called for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, the children of the flesh, these are not children of God, instead, the children of the promise are reckoned for seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is the word of promise: At this time I will come, and there will be a son by Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only so, but also Rebecca having bed from one man, our father Isaac</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(for not yet having been born, nor having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not from works, but from him who calls),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was said to her, The older will serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I regarded inferior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What will we say then? Is there injustice from God? May it not happen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he says to Moses, I will be merciful to whom I may be merciful, and I will be compassionate to whomever I may be compassionate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this same thing I raised thee up, that I might display in thee my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then he is merciful to whom he will, and whom he will he hardens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou will say to me therefore, Why does he still find fault? For who has resisted his purpose?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rather, O man, who are thou answering back to God? No, will the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why did thou make me this way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or has the potter no right over the clay, from the same lump certainly to make this vessel for esteem, and that for disesteem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if God, wanting to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and that he might make known the wealth of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he previously prepared for glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>even us whom he called, not only from Jews but also from Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As also he says in Hosea, I will call those not my people, my people, and her who was not beloved, beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it will be in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there they will be called, sons of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Since he is completing and finishing quickly a matter in righteousness, because a matter that has been cut short upon the earth, Lord will perform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And just as Isaiah has foretold, Unless Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become as Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What will we say then? That the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness from faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel who pursued a law of righteousness, did not arrive to a law of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why? Because it was not from faith but as from works of law. For they stumbled at the stone of stumbling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>just as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. And every man who believes in him will not be shamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
