Or what is the benefit of circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Much every way. First, because they were indeed entrusted with the oracles of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the assurance of God ineffective?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>May it not happen! But let it come to pass God is true, but every man a liar, as it is written, That thou may ever be justified in thy words, and may prevail when thou are criticized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous inflicting wrath? (I speak according to a man.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>May it not happen! Otherwise how will God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if by my lie, the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as sinful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm us to say) that we may do evil so that good things may come (whose condemnation is just)?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Are we better? Not at all. For we already charged both Jews and Greeks to all be under sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as it is written, There is no righteous man, not even one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is no man who understands. There is no man who seeks God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All turned away. Together they became useless. There is not a man who does goodness; there is not as much as one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an open grave. With their tongues they deceive. The poison of asps is under their lips,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and misery are in their ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the way of peace they have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that as many things as the law says, it says to those in the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become accountable to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because from works of law no flesh will be made right before him, for through law is knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now a righteousness of God has been manifested independent of law, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ is for all and upon all those who believe, for there is no distinction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>being made righteous freely by his grace, through the redemption in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God set forth an expiatory sacrifice through faith in his blood, for proof of his justice, because of the passing over of the sins that have formerly occurred</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>(in the forbearance of God), for proof of his justice at the present time, for him to be righteous, and who makes the man from Jesus' faith righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what law, of works? No, but by a law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We therefore consider a man to be made righteous by faith independent of works of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or is God of Jews only and not also of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>since God is one, who will make the man of circumcision righteous from faith, and the man of uncircumcision through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make law void through faith? May it not happen! Instead, we establish law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
