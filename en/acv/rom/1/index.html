Truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Because of this God gave them up to shameful passions, for even their females changed the natural use into what is against nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And likewise also the males, having left the natural use of the female, burned in their lust toward each other, males with males producing shamelessness, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their deviancy that was fitting</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And just as they did not approve having God in knowledge, God gave them over to an unfit mind, to do things that are not fit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>having been filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>being gossips, slanderous, God-hating, aggressors, arrogant boasters, contrivers of evil things, disobedient to parents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>without understanding, untrustworthy, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who, knowing the righteousness of God, that those who commit such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also favor those who do.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
