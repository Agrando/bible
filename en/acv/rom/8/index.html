But if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, this man is not of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if Christ is in you, the body is indeed dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up the Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwells in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if ye live according to flesh, ye are going to die, but if in spirit ye kill the deeds of the body, ye will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For ye did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if children, also heirs, heirs indeed of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer jointly, so that we may also be glorified jointly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not comparable to the glory that is going to be revealed for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was made subject to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because the creation itself will also be freed from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation is groaning and travailing together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only so, but also ourselves who have the first fruit of the Spirit. And we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we were saved to hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For what is seen, why also hope for that?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait through patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And likewise also the Spirit helps our weaknesses, for we know not what we would pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he who searches the hearts knows what is the mentality of the Spirit, because he appeals to God for the sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, who are the called according to purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be of similar nature of the form of his Son, in order for him to be the firstborn son among many brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And whom he predestined, these he also called, and whom he called, these he also made righteous, and whom he made righteous, these he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then will we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who did not even spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not also give us all things with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who will accuse against the chosen of God? God is he who makes righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he who will condemn? It is Christ who died, but more, who also was raised up, who also is at the right hand of God, who also appeals for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or restriction, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Just as it is written, For thy sake we are killed the whole day long. We are considered as sheep of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor heavenly agents, nor principal positions, nor powers, nor things that have come, nor things that are coming,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
