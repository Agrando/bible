(that is, to bring Christ down)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>or, Who will descend into the abyss? (That is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what does it say? The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is, the word of faith that we preach:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that if thou will confess with thy mouth, Lord Jesus, and will believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For a man believes in the heart for righteousness, and he confesses with the mouth for salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the scripture says, Every man who believes in him will not be shamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no distinction of a Jew and also of a Greek, for the same Lord is of all men, being rich toward all those who call upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For every man, whoever may call upon the name of Lord will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then will they call on whom they have not believed? And how will they believe of whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without preaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim good news of peace, of those who proclaim good news of good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But not all were obedient to the good-news, for Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith is from hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, did they, no, not hear? Rather, Their voice went forth into all the earth, and their sayings to the limits of the inhabited world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, did Israel, no, not know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy toward a non-nation. Toward a foolish nation, I will make you angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaiah is very bold and says, I was found by those not seeking me. I became manifest to those not asking for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But to Israel he says, The whole day I stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and rebellious people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
