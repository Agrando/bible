The law is sin? May it not happen! Yet I did not know sin except through law. For likewise I would not have known lust, if the law did not say, Thou shall not covet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, having taken opportunity through the commandment, wrought in me every evil desire, for apart from law sin is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I was alive once apart from law, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I found to me, the commandment being for life, this is for death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, having taken opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the law is indeed holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Has therefore what is good become death to me? May it not happen! Instead, it is sin, so that it might be revealed, sin working death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful to extreme.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, having been sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I do not understand what I do, for I do not do this that I want, but what I hate, this I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if I do this that I do not want, I agree with the law that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But now I no longer perform it, but the sin dwelling in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh, for to will is present in me, but to do the good, I find not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I do not do good that I want, instead, wrong that I do not want, this I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I do this that I do not want, I no longer perform it, but sin dwelling in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Consequently I find the law in my wanting to do good, that evil is present in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see a different law in my body-parts, warring against the law of my mind, and taking me captive in the law of sin, which is in my body-parts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I am a wretched man. Who will rescue me out of the body of this death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, I of myself in the mind indeed serve a law of God, but in the flesh a law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
