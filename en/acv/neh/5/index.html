Let us get grain that we may eat and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There were some also who said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain because of the dearth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There were also who said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute [upon] our fields and our vineyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our sons as their sons. And, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]. Neither is it in our</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the ranking men and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, everyone of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said to them, According to our ability we have redeemed our brothers the Jews, who were sold to the nations, and would ye even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us? Then they were silent, and found not a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them, so will we do, even as thou say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, who does not perform this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.

Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any land. And all my servants were gathered there to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were round about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep, also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine.
