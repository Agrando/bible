And blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted abo</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou are LORD, even thou alone, thou have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preserve them all. And the host of heaven worshi</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou are LORD, the God who chose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and found his heart faithful before thee, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land, for thou knew that they dealt proudly against them, and got thee a name, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thou divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land. And thou cast their pursuers into the depths as a stone into the mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou led them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou also came down upon mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and TRUE laws, good statutes and commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and made known to them thy holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which thou had sworn to give them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they and our fathers dealt proudly and stiffened their neck, and did not hearken to thy commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou did among them, but stiffened their neck. And in their rebellion they appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou are a God ready to pardon, gracious a</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, when they had made a molten calf for them, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yet thou in thy manifold mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way, neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light, and the way in which</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou also gave thy good Spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold thy manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, forty years thou sustained them in the wilderness, [and] they lacked nothing; their clothes did not grow old, and their feet did not swell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover thou gave them kingdoms and peoples, which thou allotted after their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Their sons thou also multiplied as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land concerning which thou said to their fathers that they should go in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the sons went in and possessed the land. And thou subdued the inhabitants of the land before them, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as th</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and killed thy prophets who testified against them to turn them again to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore thou delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. And in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou heard from heaven, and according to thy manifold mercies thou gave them saviors</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after they had rest, they again did evil before thee. Therefore thou left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them. Yet when they returned, and cried to thee, thou heard from heaven, and many t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and testified against them, that thou might bring them again to thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and did not hearken to thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances (which if a man does, he shall live in them), and withdre</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yet many years thou bore with them, and testified against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore thou gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them, for thou are a gracious and merciful God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our rulers, and on our priests, an</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>However thou are just in all that has come upon us, for thou have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>neither have our kings, our rulers, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies with which thou testified against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gave them, and in the large and fat land which thou gave before them, neither did they turn from their wicked works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we are servants in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it yields much increase to the kings whom thou have set over us because of our sins. Also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it, and our rulers, our Levites, [and] our priests, seal to it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
