However our God turned the curse into a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the s</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. And after certain days I asked leave of the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it grieved me greatly. Therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers. And there I brought again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each one to his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah, and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah. For they were counted faithful, and their busin</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days I saw in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys [therewith], as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on t</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There dwelt men of Tyre also in it who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I contended with the ranking men of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath. And I set some of my servant</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye lodge around the wall? If ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy loving k</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And their sons spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet there was no king like him among many nations, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shall we then hearken to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I chased him from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, each one in his work,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
