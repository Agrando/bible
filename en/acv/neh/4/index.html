Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rub</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox goes up he shall break down their stone wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear, O our God, for we are despised, and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and do not cover their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee, for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together to half [the height] of it, for the people had a mind to work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and all of them together conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens has become feeble, and there is much rubbish, so that we are not able to build the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass that, when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where ye shall return to us they will be upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore I set in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I looked, and rose up, and said to the ranking men, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them. Remember LORD, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to naught, that we returned all of us to the wall, every man to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants labored in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail. And the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They all built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves, every man with one of his hands labored in the work, and with the other held his weapon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the builders, every man had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he who sounded the trumpet was by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said to the ranking men, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In whatever place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, gather ye there to us, our God will fight for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So we labored in the work, and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let each with his servant lodge within Jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, everyone [went with] his weapon [to] the water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
