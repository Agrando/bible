He has broken my bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He has built against me, and encompassed me with gall and travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those who have long been dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He has walled me around, that I cannot go forth. He has made my chain heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He has walled up my ways with hewn stone.
