The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even the jackals draw out the breast; they give suck to their young ones. The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The tongue of the sucking child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst. The young sons ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those who fed luxuriously are desolate in the streets. Those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Her ranking men were purer than snow. They were whiter than milk. They were more ruddy in body than rubies. Their polishing was as of sapphire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their visage is blacker than a coal. They are not known in the streets. Their skin clings to their bones. It is withered. It has become like a stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those who are slain with the sword are better than those who are slain with hunger, for these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children. They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>LORD has accomplished his wrath. He has poured out his fierce anger, and he has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured the foundations thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The kings of the earth did not believe, nor all the inhabitants of the world, that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>[It is] because of the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, who have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They wander as blind men in the streets. They are polluted with blood, so that men cannot touch their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Depart ye, they cried to them. Unclean! Depart, depart, do not touch! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn [here].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The anger of LORD has scattered them. He will no more regard them. They did not respect the persons of the priests. They did not favor the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Our eyes do yet fail [in looking] for our vain help. In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets. Our end is near, our days are fulfilled, for our end has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens. They chased us upon the mountains. They laid wait for us in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, who dwells in the land of Uz. [Yet] the cup shall pass through to thee also. Thou shall be drunken, and shall make thyself naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion. He will no more carry thee away into captivity. He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom. He will uncover thy sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
