Behold, and see our reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We are orphans and fatherless. Our mothers are as widows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We have drunken our water for money. Our wood is sold to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Our pursuers are upon our necks. We are weary, and have no rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers sinned, and are not, and we have borne their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Servants rule over us. There is none to deliver us out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Our skin is black like an oven, because of the burning heat of famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rulers were hanged up by their hand. The faces of elders were not honored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The young men bore the mill, and the sons stumbled under the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The joy of our heart is ceased, our dance is turned into mourning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us! For we have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this our heart is faint. For these things our eyes are dim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate. The foxes walk upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou, O LORD, abide forever. Thy throne is from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Why do thou forget us forever, [and] forsake us so long time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Turn thou us back to thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned back. Renew our days as of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But thou have utterly rejected us. Thou are very angry against us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
