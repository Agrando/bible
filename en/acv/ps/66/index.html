Make his praise glorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Say to God, How awesome are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power thine enemies shall submit themselves to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing to thee. They shall sing to thy name. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Come, and see the works of God, awesome in actions toward the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He turned the sea into dry land. They went through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He rules by his might forever. His eyes observe the nations. Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who holds our soul in life, and does not allow our feet to be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For thou, O God, have proved us.

Thou laid a great burden upon our loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou caused men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water. But thou brought us out into a wealthy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings. I will pay thee my vows,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>which my lips uttered, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will offer to thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, with the incense of rams. I will offer bullocks with goats.
