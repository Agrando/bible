Set me on high from those who rise up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the bloodthirsty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For, lo, they lay in wait for my soul. The mighty gather themselves together against me, not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They run and prepare themselves without [my] fault. Awake thou to help me, and behold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even thou, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, arise to visit all the nations. Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They return at evening. They howl like a dog, and go round about the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, they belch out with their mouth. Swords are in their lips, for [they say], Who hears?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But thou, O LORD, will laugh at them. Thou will have all the nations in derision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O my strength, I will give heed to thee, for God is my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My God with his loving kindness will meet me. God will let me look upon my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Kill them not, lest my people forget. Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O LORD our shield,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>[for] the sin of their mouth, [and] the words of their lips. Let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more. And let them know that God rules in Jacob, to the ends of the earth. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, and go round about the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They shall wander up and down for food, and tarry all night if they be not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I will sing of thy strength. Yea, I will sing aloud of thy loving kindness in the morning. For thou have been my high tower, and a refuge in the day of my distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To thee, O my strength, I will sing praises. For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
