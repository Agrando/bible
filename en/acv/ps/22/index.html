They trusted, and thou delivered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They cried to thee, and were delivered. They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I am a worm, and no man, a reproach of men, and despised by the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All those who see me laugh me to scorn. They shoot out the lip. They shake the head, [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He trusted on LORD. Let him deliver him. Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But thou are he who took me out of the womb. Thou made me trust upon my mother's breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I was cast upon thee from the womb. Thou are my God since my mother bore me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Be not far from me, for trouble is near, for there is none to help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Many bulls have encompassed me. Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They gape upon me with their mouth, [as] a ravening and a roaring lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is melted within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue clings to my jaws, and thou have brought me into the dust of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For dogs have encompassed me. A company of evil-doers have enclosed me. They pierced (LXX/DSS) my hands and my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I may count all my bones. They look and stare upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They part my garments among them, and upon my vesture do they cast a lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But be thou not far off, O LORD. O thou my succor, hasten thee to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Deliver my soul from the sword, the only one of me from the power of the dog.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Save me from the lion's mouth, yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen. Thou have answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will declare thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ye who fear LORD, praise him. All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him, and stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither has he hid his face from him, but when he cried to him, he heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>From thee comes my praise in the great assembly. I will pay my vows before those who fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The meek shall eat and be satisfied. They shall praise LORD who seek after him. Let your heart live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to LORD, and all the kinfolk of the nations shall worship before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the kingdom is LORD's, and he is the ruler over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship.
