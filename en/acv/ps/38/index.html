As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am pained and bowed down greatly. I go mourning all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am faint and severely bruised. I have groaned because of the disquietness of my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>LORD, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My heart throbs, my strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Those I love and my friends stand aloof from my plague, and my kinsmen stand afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those also who seek after my life lay snares [for me]. And those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I, as a deaf man, hear not. And I am as a mute man who opens not his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yea, I am as a man who hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For in thee, O LORD, do I hope. Thou will answer, O LORD my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I said, Lest they rejoice over me. When my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I am ready to fall, and my sorrow is continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But my enemies are energetic, [and] are strong, and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They also who render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow the thing that is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Forsake me not, O LORD. O my God, be not far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Make haste to help me, O LORD, my salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
