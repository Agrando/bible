My steps had well nigh slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there are no pangs in their death, but their strength is firm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are not in trouble as [other] men, nor are they plagued like [other] men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore pride is as a chain around their neck. Violence covers them as a garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their eyes stand out with fatness. They have more than heart could wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression. They speak loftily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They have set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore his people return here, and waters of a full [cup] are drained by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they say, How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these are the wicked, and those who always prosper. They have possessed wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for all the day long I have been plagued, and chastened every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I had said, I will speak thus, behold, I would have dealt treacherously with the generation of thy sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I thought how I might understand this, it was too painful for me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>until I went into the sanctuary of God, and considered their latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Surely thou set them in slippery places. Thou cast them down to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How they have become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As a dream from awakening, O LORD, when thou waken, thou will despise their form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For my soul was grieved, and I was pricked in my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So I was brutish, and ignorant. I was a beast before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless I am continually with thee. Thou have held my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou will guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom have I in heaven? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My flesh and my heart fails, [but] God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, lo, those who are far from thee shall perish. Thou have destroyed all those who go a whoring from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But it is good for me to draw near to God. I have made lord LORD my refuge, that I may tell of all thy works.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
