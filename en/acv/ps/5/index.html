In the morning I will direct to thee, and will keep watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thou are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil shall not sojourn with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight. Thou hate all workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou will destroy those who speak lies. LORD abhors the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But as for me, in the abundance of thy loving kindness I will come into thy house. In thy fear I will worship toward thy holy temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of my enemies. Make thy way straight before my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their inward part is very wickedness. Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongue they deceive (LXX/NT).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hold them guilty, O God. Let them fall by their own counsels. Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions. For they have rebelled against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But let all those who take refuge in thee rejoice. Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defend them. Let those also who love thy name be joyful in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thou will bless the righteous man, O LORD. Thou will encompass him with favor as with a shield. Selah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
