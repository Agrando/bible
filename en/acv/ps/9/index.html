I will show forth all thy marvelous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will be glad and exult in thee. I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish at thy presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thou have maintained my right and my cause. Thou sit in the throne judging righteously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou have rebuked the nations. Thou have destroyed the wicked. Thou have blotted out their name forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The enemy have come to an end. They are desolate forever, and the cities which thou have overthrown. The very memory of them is perished,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but LORD will endure forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he will judge the world in righteousness. He will minister justice to the peoples in uprightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>LORD will also be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And those who know thy name will put their trust in thee, for thou, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sing praises to LORD, who dwells in Zion. Declare among the people his doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For he who makes inquiry for blood remembers them. He does not forget the cry of the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Have mercy upon me, O LORD. Behold my affliction from those who hate me, thou who lifts me up from the gates of death</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>LORD has made himself known. He has executed justice. The wicked man is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wicked men shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For a needy man shall not always be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Arise, O LORD, let not man prevail. Let the nations be judged in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Put them in fear, O LORD. Let the nations know themselves to be but men.
