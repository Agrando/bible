I speak the things which I have made concerning the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thou are fairer than the sons of men. Grace is poured into thy lips. Therefore God has blessed thee forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, thy glory and thy majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And in thy majesty ride on prosperously because of truth and gentleness [and] righteousness. And thy right hand shall teach thee awesome things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thine arrows are sharp. The peoples fall under thee. [They are] in the heart of the king's enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. A scepter of straightness is the scepter of thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All thy garments [smell of] myrrh, and aloes, [and] cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Kings' daughters are among thy honorable women. At thy right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear. Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So will the king desire thy beauty, for he is thy lord, and reverence thou him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the daughter of Tyre shall adore him with a gift. The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Inside, the king's daughter is all glorious. Her clothing is embroidered with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She shall be led to the king in broidered work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led. They shall enter into the king's palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shall make rulers in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore the peoples shall give thee thanks forever and ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
