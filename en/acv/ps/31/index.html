Let me never be put to shame. Deliver me in thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Bow down thine ear to me. Deliver me speedily. Be thou to me a strong rock, a house of defense to save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For thou are my rock and my fortress. Therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, for thou are my stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Into thy hand I commend my spirit. Thou have redeemed me, O LORD, thou God of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I hate those who regard lying vanities, but I trust in LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will be glad and rejoice in thy loving kindness, for thou have seen my affliction. Thou have known my soul in adversities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and thou have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. Thou have set my feet in a large place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in distress. My eye wastes away with grief, [yea], my soul and my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing. My strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones are wasted away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become a reproach because of all my adversaries, yea, to my neighbors exceedingly, and a fear to my acquaintances. Those who saw me outside fled from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind. I am like a broken vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have heard the slander of many. Fear [was] on every side, while they took counsel together against me. They devised to take away my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I trusted in thee, O LORD. I said, Thou are my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My times are in thy hand. Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant. Save me in thy loving kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be put to shame. Let them be silent in Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let the lying lips be dumb, which speak against the righteous man insolently, with pride and contempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O how great is thy goodness, which thou have laid up for those who fear thee, which thou have wrought for those who take refuge in thee before the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In the covert of thy presence thou will hide them from the plotting of man. Thou will keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed be LORD, for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes. Nevertheless thou heard the voice of my supplications when I cried to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O love LORD, all ye his sanctified. LORD preserves the faithful, and plentifully repays him who deals proudly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye who hope in LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
