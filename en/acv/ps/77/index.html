My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not. My soul refused to be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I remember God, and am disquieted. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thou have held my eyelids watching. I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I call to remembrance my song in the night. I commune with my own heart, and my spirit makes diligent search.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will LORD cast off forever?

The depths also trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The clouds poured out water. The skies sent out a sound. Thine arrows also went abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lightened the world. The earth trembled and shook.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy way was in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters. And thy footsteps were not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou led thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
