I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary with my crying. My throat is dried. My eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who would cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. That which I took not away I have to restore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, thou know my foolishness, and my sins are not hid from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not those who wait for thee be put to shame through me, O lord LORD of hosts. Let not those who seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach, shame has covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I have become a stranger to my brothers, and an alien to my mother's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the zeal of thy house has eaten me up, and the reproaches of those who reproach thee have fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When I wept in my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those who sit in the gate talk of me, and [I am] the song of the drunkards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O LORD. In an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of thy loving kindness, answer me in the truth of thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not the water flood overwhelm me, nor let the deep shallow me up. And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Answer me, O LORD, for thy loving kindness is good. According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in distress. Answer me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw near to my soul, and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou know my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They also gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let their table before them become a snare, and when they are in peace, a trap, and for a stumbling block, and for a retribution to them (LXX/NT).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, and bow down their back (LXX/NT) continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let their habitation be desolate. Let none dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they persecute him whom thou have smitten, and they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou have wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Add iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I am poor and sorrowful. Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and it will please LORD better than an ox, [or] a bullock that has horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The meek have seen it, and are glad. Ye who seek after God, let your heart live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For LORD hears the needy, and does not despise his prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moves therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The seed also of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell therein.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
