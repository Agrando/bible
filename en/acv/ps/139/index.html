Thou understand my thought afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou search out my path and my laying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou know it altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou have beset me behind and before, and laid thy hand upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>[Such] knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is high, I cannot attain to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Where shall I go from thy Spirit? Or where shall I flee from thy presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I ascend up into heaven, thou are there. If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou are there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the outermost parts of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>even there thy hand shall lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me, and the light around me shall be night,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>even the darkness hides not from thee, but the night shines as the day. The darkness and the light are both alike [to thee].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For thou formed my inward parts. Thou covered me in my mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will give thanks to thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are thy works, and that my soul knows right well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My frame was not hidden from thee, when I was made in secret, curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thine eyes saw my unformed substance, and in thy book they were all written, [even] the days that were ordained, when as yet there was none of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How precious also are thy thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I count them; they are more in number than the sand. When I awake, I am still with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Surely thou will kill the wicked, O God. Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take [it] in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do I not hate them, O LORD, who hate thee? And am I not grieved with those who rise up against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I hate them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and see if there is any wicked way in me. And lead me in the way everlasting.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
