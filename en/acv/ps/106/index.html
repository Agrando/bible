O give thanks to LORD, for he is good, for his loving kindness [is] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of LORD, or show forth all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are those who keep justice, and he who does righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O LORD, with the favor that thou bear to thy people. O visit me with thy salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers did not understand thy wonders in Egypt. They did not remember the multitude of thy loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He also rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up. So he led them through the depths as through a wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They soon forgot his works. They did not wait for his counsel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and challenged God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They also envied Moses in the camp, [and] Aaron the sanctified of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>wondrous works in the land of Ham, [and] fearful things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yea, they despised the pleasant land. They did not believe his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but murmured in their tents, and did not hearken to the voice of LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore he swore to them, that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They also joined themselves to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, and so the plague was stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And that was reckoned to him for righteousness to all generations for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They also angered him at the waters of Meribah, so that it went ill with Moses because of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they were rebellious against his spirit, and he spoke ill-advisedly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the peoples, as LORD commanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and served their idols, which became a snare to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. And the land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus they were defiled with their works, and played the harlot in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore the wrath of LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave them into the hand of the nations. And those who hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless he regarded their distress when he heard their cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he remembered his covenant for them, and relented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He also made them to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
