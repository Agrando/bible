With my mouth I will make known thy faithfulness to all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever. Thy faithfulness thou will establish in the very heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have made a covenant with my chosen. I have sworn to David my servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thy seed I will establish forever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD, thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For who in the clouds can be compared to LORD? Who among the sons of the mighty is like LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>a God very awesome in the council of the holy ones, and to be feared above all those who are round about him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O LORD God of hosts, who is a mighty one like thee, O LORD? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou rule the pride of the sea. When the waves of it arise, thou still them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou have broken Rahab in pieces, as a wounded man. Thou have scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine, the world and the fullness of it; thou have founded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The north and the south, thou have created them. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou have a mighty arm. Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne. Loving kindness and truth go before thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blessed is the people who know the joyful sound. They walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In thy name do they rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness are they exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thou are the glory of their strength, and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For our shield belongs to LORD, and our king to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then thou spoke in a vision to thy sanctified, and said, I have laid help upon a mighty [man]. I have exalted a chosen [man] out of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have found David my servant. With my holy oil I have anointed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>with whom my hand shall be established. My arm also shall strengthen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The enemy shall not exact from him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will beat down his adversaries before him, and smite those who hate him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but my faithfulness and my loving kindness shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I will also set his hand on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He shall cry to me, Thou are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I also will make him first-born, the highest of the kings of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I will keep my loving kindness for him for evermore. And my covenant shall stand fast with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will also make his seed to endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If his sons forsake my law, and walk not in my ordinances,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>then I will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but my loving kindness I will not utterly take from him, nor allow my faithfulness to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I will not break my covenant, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have sworn once by my holiness; I will not lie to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>It shall be established forever as the moon, and [as] the faithful witness in the sky. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But thou have cast off and rejected. Thou have been angry with thine anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thou have abhorred the covenant of thy servant. Thou have profaned his crown to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou have broken down all his hedges. Thou have brought his strongholds to ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>All who pass by the way rob him. He has become a reproach to his neighbors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Thou have exalted the right hand of his adversaries. Thou have made all his enemies to rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Yea, thou turn back the edge of his sword, and have not made him to stand in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thou have made his brightness to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The days of his youth thou have shortened. Thou have covered him with shame. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>How long, O LORD? Will thou hide thyself forever? Shall thy wrath burn like fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>O remember how short my time is, for what vanity thou have created all the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>LORD, where are thy former loving kindnesses, which thou swore to David in thy faithfulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Remember, LORD, the reproach of thy servants, how I bear in my bosom all the mighty peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>with which thine enemies have reproached, O LORD, with which they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Blessed be LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
