Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth in parables (LXX/NT). I will utter dark sayings of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not hide them from their sons, telling to the generation to come the praises of LORD, and his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that the generation to come might know, even the sons who should be born, who should arise and tell to their sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and might not be as their fathers: a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The sons of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they forgot his doings, and his wondrous works that he had shown them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through. And he made the waters to stand as a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet they went on to still sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they challenged God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, they spoke against God. They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore LORD heard, and was angry. And a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them food from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man ate the bread of the mighty. He sent them food to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he guided the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He also rained flesh upon them as the dust, and winged birds as the sand of the seas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they ate, and were well filled, and he gave them their own desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were not estranged from that which they desired. Their food was yet in their mouths</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>when the anger of God went up against them, and killed of the fattest of them, and smote down the young men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they still sinned, and did not believe in his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he killed them, then they inquired after him, and they returned and sought God earnestly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not right with him, nor were they faithful in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and destroyed not. Yea, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and comes not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they turned again and challenged God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They did not remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>how he set his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He also gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a band of [heavenly] agents of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a path for his anger. He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and smote all the first-born in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he led them safely, so that they feared not, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He also drove out the nations before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they challenged and rebelled against the Most High God, and kept not his testimonies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When God heard, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>so that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and delivered their strength into captivity, and their glory into the adversary's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Fire devoured their young men, and their virgins had no marriage-song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then LORD awoke as out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And he smote his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He brought him from following the ewes that have their young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
