Incline thine ear to me. In the day when I call answer me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For my days consume away like smoke, and my bones are burned as a firebrand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart is smitten like grass, and withered, for I forget to eat my bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because of the voice of my groaning my bones cling to my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I have become as an owl of the waste places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone upon the house-top.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My enemies reproach me all the day. Those who are mad against me do curse by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>because of thine indignation and thy wrath. For thou have taken me up, and cast me away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My days are like a shadow that declines, and I am withered like grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But thou, O LORD, will abide forever, and thy memorial to all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou will arise, and have mercy upon Zion, for it is time to have pity upon her, yea, the set time has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity upon her dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the nations shall fear the name of LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For LORD has built up Zion. He has appeared in his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He has regarded the prayer of the destitute, and has not despised their prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This shall be written for the generation to come. And a people which shall be created shall praise LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven LORD beheld the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>to hear the sighing of the prisoner, to loose those who are appointed to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that men may declare the name of LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>when the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He weakened my strength in the way. He shortened my days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days. Thy years are throughout all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Of old thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They shall perish, but thou shall endure. Yea, all of them shall grow old like a garment. As a vesture thou shall change them, and they shall be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but thou are the same, and thy years shall have no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The sons of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
