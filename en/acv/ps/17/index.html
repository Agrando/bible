Let thine eyes look upon equity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou have proved my heart. Thou have visited me in the night. Thou have tried me, and find nothing. I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept from the ways of a violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My steps have held fast to thy paths.
