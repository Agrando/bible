LORD is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, [even] my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, even then I will be confident.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>One thing I have asked of LORD, that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of LORD, and to inquire in his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For in the day of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion. In the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me. He will lift me up upon a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing, yea, I will sing praises to LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice.
