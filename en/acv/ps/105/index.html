Talk ye of all his marvelous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek LORD rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Seek ye LORD and his strength. Seek his face evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye sons of Jacob, his chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is LORD our God. His judgments are in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>which he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>saying, To thee I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>when they were but a few men in number, yea, very few, and sojourners in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[saying], Touch not my anointed men, and do my prophets no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he called for a famine upon the land.

They ran in the dry places [like] a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he remembered his holy word, [and] Abraham his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he brought forth his people with joy, [and] his chosen with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labor of the peoples in possession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise ye LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
