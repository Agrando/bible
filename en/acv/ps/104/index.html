O LORD my God, thou are very great. Thou are clothed with honor and majesty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>who covers thyself with light as with a garment, who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters, who makes the clouds his chariot, who walks upon the wings of the wind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who makes his [heavenly] agents spirits, his ministers a flame of fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be moved forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou covered it with the deep as with a vesture. The waters stood above the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>At thy rebuke they fled. At the voice of thy thunder they hastened away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place which thou had founded for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou have set a bound that they may not pass over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He sends forth springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They give drink to every beast of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation. They sing among the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He waters the mountains from his chambers. The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herbage for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and wine that makes glad the heart of man, [and] oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man's heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The trees of LORD are full, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>where the birds make their nests. As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the conies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows his going down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou make darkness, and it is night, during which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The sun arises; they get away, and lay down in their dens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O LORD, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom have thou made them all. The earth is full of thy riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yonder is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable creeping things, both small and great beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There go the ships. There is leviathan, whom thou have formed to play in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>These all wait for thee, that thou may give them their food in due season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou give to them, they gather. Thou open thy hand, they are satisfied with good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thou hide thy face, they are troubled. Thou take away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thou send forth thy Spirit, they are created, and thou renew the face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let the glory of LORD endure forever. Let LORD rejoice in his works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who looks on the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I will sing to LORD as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let thy meditation be sweet to him. I will rejoice in LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless LORD, O my soul. Praise ye LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
