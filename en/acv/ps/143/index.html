Give ear to my supplications. In thy faithfulness answer me, [and] in thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And enter not into judgment with thy servant. For in thy sight no man living is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the enemy has persecuted my soul. He has smitten my life down to the ground.
