I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked man is before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was mute with silence. I held my peace, even from good, and my sorrow was stirred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My heart was hot within me. While I was musing the fire burned. [Then] I spoke with my tongue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>LORD, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is. Let me know how frail I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, thou have made my days [as] handbreadths, and my life-time is as nothing before thee. Surely every man at his best condition is altogether vanity. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Surely every man walks in a shadow. Surely they are disquieted in vain. He heaps up, and knows not who shall gather them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now, LORD, what do I wait for? My hope is in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Deliver me from all my transgressions. Make me not the reproach of the foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was mute. I opened not my mouth, because thou did it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Remove thy stroke away from me. I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When thou have corrected man with rebukes for iniquity, thou make his beauty to disintegrate like a moth. Surely every man is vanity. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry. Keep not silent at my tears, for I am a stranger with thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O spare me, that I may recover strength before I go from here, and be no more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
