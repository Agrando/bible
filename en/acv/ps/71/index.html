Let me never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me. Bow down thine ear to me, and save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Be thou to me a rock of habitation to which I may continually resort. Thou have given commandment to save me, for thou are my rock and my fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of a wicked man, out of the hand of an unrighteous and cruel man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thou are my hope, O lord LORD, my trust from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>By thee I have been held up from the womb. Thou are he who took me out of my mother's bowels. My praise shall be continually of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I am as a speculate to many, but thou are my strong refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, and with thy honor all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Cast me not off in the time of old age. Forsake me not when my strength fails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For my enemies speak concerning me, and those who watch for my soul take counsel together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>saying, God has forsaken him. Pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>O God, be not far from me. O my God, make haste to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let them be put to shame [and] consumed who are adversaries to my soul. Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor who seek my hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I will hope continually, and will praise thee yet more and more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness, of thy salvation all the day, for I know not the numbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will come with the mighty acts of lord LORD. I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O God, thou have taught me from my youth, and I have declared thy wondrous works until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yea, even when I am old and gray headed, O God, forsake me not, until I have declared thy strength to a generation, thy might to everyone who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, thou who have done great things. O God, who is like thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou, who have shown us many and great troubles, will revive us again, and will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Increase thou my greatness, and turn again and comfort me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also praise thee with the psaltery, [even] thy truth, O my God. To thee I will sing praises with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises to thee, and my soul, which thou have redeemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long. For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, who seek my hurt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
