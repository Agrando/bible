They found no city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they cried to LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He also led them by a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O that men would praise LORD for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he satisfies the longing soul, and he fills the hungry soul with good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[even] those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because they rebelled against the words of God, and scorned the counsel of the Most High.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was none to help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they cried to LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bonds apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O that men would praise LORD for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools are afflicted because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their soul abhors all manner of food, and they draw near to the gates of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they cry to LORD in their trouble, and he saves them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers [them] from their destructions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>O that men would praise LORD for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>these [men] see the works of LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they cry to LORD in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He makes the storm a calm, so that the waves of it are still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they are glad because they are quiet, so he brings them to their desired haven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O that men would praise LORD for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let them also exalt him in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He turns rivers into a wilderness, and water springs into a thirsty ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>a fruitful land into a salt desert, for the wickedness of those who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city of habitation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get fruits of increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He also blesses them, so that they are multiplied greatly, and he does not allow their cattle to decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He pours contempt upon rulers, and causes them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yet he sets a needy man on high from affliction, and makes [him] families like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The upright shall see it, and be glad. And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He who is wise will give heed to these things, and they will consider the loving kindnesses of LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
