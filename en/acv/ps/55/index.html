I am restless in my complaint, and moan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they cast iniquity upon me, and in anger they persecute me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart is greatly pained within me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! Then I would fly away, and be at rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo, then I would wander far off. I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I would hasten myself to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Destroy, O LORD, divide their tongue, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Day and night they go about it, upon the walls of it. Iniquity and mischief also are in the midst of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wickedness is in the midst of it. Oppression and deceit depart not from its streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it was not an enemy who reproached me. Then I could have borne it. Neither was it he who hated me that magnified himself against me. Then I would have hid myself from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But it was thou, a man my equal, my companion, and my familiar friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We took sweet counsel together. We walked in the house of God with the throng.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let death come suddenly upon them. Let them go down alive into Sheol. For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for me, I will call upon God, and LORD will save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Evening, and morning, and at noonday, I will complain and moan. And he will hear my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there were many by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God will hear, and respond to them, (even he who abides of old), Selah, [men] who have no changes, and who fear not God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He has put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him. He has profaned his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war. His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>(Cast thy burden upon LORD, and he will sustain thee. He will never allow the righteous man to be moved.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But thou, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
