Dwell in the land, and feed on [his] faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Delight thyself also in LORD, and he will give thee the desires of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Commit thy way to LORD. Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, and thy justice as the noon-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rest in LORD, and wait patiently for him. Fret not thyself because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. Fret not thyself, [it tends] only to evil-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evil-doers shall be cut off, but those who wait for LORD, they shall inherit the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For yet a little while, and the wicked man shall not be. Yea, thou shall diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked man plots against the righteous man, and gnashes upon him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>LORD will laugh at him, for he sees that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to kill such as are upright in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is a little that the righteous man has than the abundance of many wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but LORD upholds the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>LORD knows the days of the perfect, and their inheritance shall be forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of LORD [is] as the fat of lambs: they shall disintegrate; they shall disintegrate away into smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked man borrows, and pays not again, but the righteous man deals graciously, and gives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land, and those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man's goings are established by LORD, and he delights in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for LORD upholds him with his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen a righteous man forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day long he deals graciously, and lends, and his seed is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For LORD loves justice, and forsakes not his sanctified. They are preserved forever, but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell in it forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of a righteous man talks of wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God is in his heart.

Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for there is a [happy] end to the man of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The end of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is of LORD. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and LORD helps them, and rescues them. He rescues them from sinners, and saves them, because they have taken refuge in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
