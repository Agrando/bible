They have defiled thy holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be food to the birds of the heavens, the flesh of thy sanctified to the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are round about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>How long, O LORD? will thou be angry forever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that do not know thee, and upon the kingdoms that do not call upon thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not remember against us the iniquities of our forefathers.

Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed be known among the nations in our sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee. According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those who are appointed to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and render to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached thee, O LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks forever. We will show forth thy praise to all generations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
