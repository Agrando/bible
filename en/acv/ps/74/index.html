Why does thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Remember thy congregation, which thou have gotten of old, which thou have redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance, [and] mount Zion, at which thou have dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lift up thy feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly. They have set up their ensigns for signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They seemed as men who lifted up axes upon a thicket of trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now they break down all the carved work of it with hatchet and hammers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have set thy sanctuary on fire. They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether. They have burned up all the meeting-places of God in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We do not see our signs. There is no more any prophet, nor is there among us he who knows how long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why do thou draw back thy hand, even thy right hand? Remove [it] from the midst of thy bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou divided the sea by thy strength. Thou break the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou break the heads of leviathan in pieces. Thou gave him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou split fountain and flood. Thou dried up mighty rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The day is thine; the night is also thine. Thou have prepared the light and the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou have set all the borders of the earth. Thou have made summer and winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O LORD, and that a foolish people has blasphemed thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove to the wild beast. Forget not the life of thy poor forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Have respect to the covenant, for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>O let not he who is oppressed return ashamed. Let a poor and needy man praise thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Arise, O God, plead thine own cause. Remember how the foolish man reproaches thee all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Forget not the voice of thine adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against thee ascends continually.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
