Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Arise, O LORD, in thine anger. Lift up thyself against the rage of my adversaries, and awake for me the justice thou have commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And let the congregation of the peoples encompass thee about, and return thou on high over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>LORD shall judge the peoples.
