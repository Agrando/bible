Thou afflicted the peoples, but thou spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For they did not get the land in possession by their own sword, nor did their own arm save them, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou were favorable to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thou are my King, O God. Command deliverance for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Through thee we will push down our adversaries. Through thy name we will tread them under who rise up against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I will not trust in my bow, nor shall my sword save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But thou have saved us from our adversaries, and have put them to shame who hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In God we have made our boast all the day long, and we will give thanks to thy name forever.
