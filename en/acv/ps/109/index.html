They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They have also encompassed me about with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For my love they are my adversaries, but I [make] prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set thou a wicked man over him, and let an adversary stand at his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he is judged, let him come forth guilty, and let his prayer be turned into sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let his days be few, [and] let another take his office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let his sons be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let his sons be vagabonds, and beg, and let them seek out of their desolate places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let a creditor exact all that he has, and let strangers make spoil of his labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor let there be any to have pity on his fatherless sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let his posterity be cut off. In the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be before LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because he did not remember to show kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, and the broken in heart, to kill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea, he loved cursing, and it came to him. And he did not delight in blessing, and it was far from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He also clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, and it came into his inward parts like water, and like oil into his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let it be to him as the raiment with which he covers himself, and for the belt with which he is girded continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is the reward of my adversaries from LORD, and of those who speak evil against my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But deal thou with me, O lord LORD, for thy name's sake. Because thy loving kindness is good, deliver thou me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am gone like the shadow when it declines. I am tossed up and down as the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh fails of fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I also have become a reproach to them. When they see me, they shake their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Help me, O LORD my God. O save me according to thy loving kindness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they may know that this is thy hand, [that] thou, LORD, have done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them curse, but bless thou. When they arise, they shall be put to shame, but thy servant shall rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor, and let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will give great thanks to LORD with my mouth. Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who judge his soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
