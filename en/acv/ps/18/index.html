So I shall be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The cords of death encompassed me, and the floods of lawlessness made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cords of Sheol were round about me. The snares of death came upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In my distress I called upon LORD, and cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry before him came into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He also bowed the heavens, and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and flew. Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them, Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He sent from on high, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They came upon me in the day of my calamity, but LORD was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He also brought me forth into a large place. He delivered me because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I have kept the ways of LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all his ordinances were before me, and I put not away his statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was also perfect with him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the merciful thou will show thyself merciful. With the perfect man thou will show thyself perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the pure thou will show thyself pure. And with the perverse thou will show thyself contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou will save the afflicted people, but the haughty eyes thou will bring down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thou will light my lamp. LORD my God will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For by thee I run upon a troop, and by my God I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As for God, his way is perfect. The word of LORD is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who is God, except LORD? And who is a rock, besides our God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the God who girds me with strength, and makes my way perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He makes my feet like hinds' [feet], and sets me upon my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thou have also given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand has held me up, and thy gentleness has made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou have enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For thou have girded me with strength to the battle. Thou have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They cried, but there was none to save, even to LORD, but he answered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou have delivered me from the strivings of the people. Thou have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues peoples under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He rescues me from my enemies. Yea, thou lift me up above those who rise up against me. Thou deliver me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the Gentiles, and will sing praises to thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
