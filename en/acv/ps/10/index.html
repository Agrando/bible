Why do thou hide thyself in times of trouble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In the pride of the wicked man the poor man is hotly pursued. Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the wicked man boasts of his heart's desire. And the greedy man renounces, [yea], despises LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The wicked man, in the pride of his countenance, [says], He will not require [it]. All his thoughts are, There is no God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His ways are profane at all times. Thy judgments are far above out of his sight. As for all his adversaries, he puffs at them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He says in his heart, I shall not be moved. To all generations I shall not be in adversity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He sits in the lurking-places of the villages. In the covert places he murders the innocent man. His eyes are secretly set against the poor man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He lurks in secret as a lion in his covert. He lays in wait to catch the poor man. He catches the poor man when he draws him in his net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He crouches, he bows down, and helpless men fall by his strong men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He says in his heart, God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Arise, O LORD, O God, lift up thy hand. Do not forget the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why does the wicked man despise God, and say in his heart, Thou will not require [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou have seen. For thou behold mischief and spite, to repay with thy hand. The poor man commits [himself] to thee. Thou have been the helper of the fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Break thou the arm of the sinner and the evil man. His wickedness shall be sought, and shall not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>LORD is King forever and ever. The nations have perished out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>LORD, thou have heard the desire of the humble. Thou will prepare their heart, thou will cause thine ear to hear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may no more be appalling.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
