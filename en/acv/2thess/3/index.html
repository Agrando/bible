Because we did not act disorderly among you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>nor did we eat bread gratis from any man, but in labor and toil, working night and day in order not to burden any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Not because we have no right, but that we might give ourselves an example to you, in order to imitate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For even when we were with you we commanded you this, that if any man will not work, neither let him eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For we hear of some who walk among you disorderly, not working at all, but being busybodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now to such men we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with quietness, they should eat their own bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But ye, brothers, do not become weary doing good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if any man does not obey our word by this letter, note that man, and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace through everything in every way. The Lord is with all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The salutation of Paul by my hand, which is a mark in every letter I write this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with all of you.
