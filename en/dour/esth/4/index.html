And when she heard it she was in a consternation: and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the king's treasures, to have the Jews destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to en- treat him for her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>,11All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king's inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Mardochai had heard this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king a house, more than all the Jews:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father's house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
