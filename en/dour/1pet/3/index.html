And be not afraid of their fear, and be not troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death, that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
