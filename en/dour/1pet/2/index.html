And he that shall believe in him, shall not be confounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy; but now have obtained mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God's sake: whether it be to the king as excelling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of the good:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were as sheep going astray; but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
