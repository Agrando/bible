Be prudent therefore, and watch in prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But before all things have a constant mutual charity among yourselves: for charity covereth a multitude of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Using hospitality one towards another, without murmuring,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As every man hath received grace, ministering the same one to another: as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If any man speak, let him speak, as the words of God. If any man minister, let him do it, as of the power, which God administereth: that in all things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ: to whom is glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Dearly beloved, think not strange the burning heat which is to try you, as if some new thing happened to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that when his glory shall be revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed: for that which is of the honour, glory, and power of God, and that which is his Spirit, resteth upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a railer, or a coveter of other men's things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God. And if first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God, commend their souls in good deeds to the faithful Creator.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
