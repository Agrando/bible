But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall not enter into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they that heard it, said: Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
