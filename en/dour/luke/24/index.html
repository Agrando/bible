Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was in Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they remembered his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And these words seemed to them as idle tales; and they did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves; and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew night to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I, fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said: Have you any thing to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And you are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
