Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither, and kill them before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him, and bring him hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? you shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory on high!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>To whom he said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
