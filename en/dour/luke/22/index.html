And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there prepare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the pasch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I say to you, that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks, and said: Take, and divide it among you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In like manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them, are called beneficent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is it not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip; and he that hath not, let him sell his coat, and buy a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me: And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But they said: Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast; and kneeling down, he prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them: Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light, and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he is also a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter going out, wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And blaspheming, many other things they said against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the chief priests and scribes, cane together; and they brought him into their council, saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said: What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
