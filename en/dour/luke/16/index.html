To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity; that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that which is greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon; who will trust you with that which is the true?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's; who will give you that which is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, commmitteth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen; and feasted sumptuously every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
