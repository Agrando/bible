And he made signs to them, and remained dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Because no word shall be impossible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary abode with her about three months; and she returned to her own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now Elizabeth's full time of being delivered was come, and she brought forth a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbours and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great mercy towards her, and they congratulated with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by his father's name Zachary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother answering, said: Not so; but he shall be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying: John is his name. And they all wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came upon all their neighbours; and all these things were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying: What an one, think ye, shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost; and he prophesied, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the beginning:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>To perform mercy to our fathers, and to remember his holy testament,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>In holiness and justice before him, all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>To give knowledge of salvation to his people, unto the remission of their sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which the Orient from on high hath visited us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>To enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: to direct our feet into the way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit; and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
