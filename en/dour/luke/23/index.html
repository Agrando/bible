But he answering, said: Thou sayest it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will chastise him therefore, and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And it was the day of the Parasceve, and the sabbath drew on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
