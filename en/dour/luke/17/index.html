If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord said: If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou transplanted into the sea: and it would obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go, sit down to meat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper, and gird thyself, and serve me, whilst I eat and drink, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come? he answered them, and said: The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise as it came to pass, in the days of Lot: they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it, shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I say to you: in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left: two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be keft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They answering, say to him: Where, Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
