For the powers of heaven shall be moved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with great power and majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke to them in a similitude.
