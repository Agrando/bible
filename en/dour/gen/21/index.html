And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand: for I will make him a great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Abraham said: I will swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore that place was called Bersabee: because both of them did swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they made a league for the well of oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
