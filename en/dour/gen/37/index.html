Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father's docks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Israel said to him : Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the docks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they saw him afar off, be- fore he came nigh them, they thought to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit : and we will say : Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, end said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Calaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the boy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear and whither shall I go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And tearing his garments, he put an sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And alibis children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
