And it was so done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way; Joseph sendingfor the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cup which you have stolen is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?\</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Them they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph, (for he was not yet gone out of the place, ) and they altogether fell down before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Joseph answered: God forbid that should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Juda coming hearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears,and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead: and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him: and hitherto he appeareth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore if I shall go to thy servant our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let me be tht proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore I thy servant will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
