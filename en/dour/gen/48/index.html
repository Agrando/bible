And being strengthened he sat on his bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when Joseph was come in to him, he said : God Almighty appeared to me at Lute, which is in the land of Chanaan: and he blessed me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said : I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Ohanaan in the very journey, and it was springtime: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me that I may bless them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee: moreover God hath shewed me thy seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he set Ephraim on his right bend, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses who was the elder, changing his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father's hand he tried to lift it from Ephraims head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father: for this is the first- born, put thy right hand upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become peoples, and shall be multiplied: but this younger brother shall be greater than he: and his seed shall grow into nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to Joseph his son: Be- hold I die, and God will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite a with my sword and bow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
