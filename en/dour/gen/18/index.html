He said: I will not destroy it for the sake of forty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee, if I speak: What if thirty shall be found there?

He said: I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord, if I speak yet once more: What if tell should be found there ? And he said: I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Lord departed, after he had left speaking to Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
