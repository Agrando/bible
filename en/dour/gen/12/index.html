And when they were come into it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Abram passed through the country into the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; he built there also an altar to the Lord, and called upon his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abram went forward, going, and proceeding on to the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And there came a famine in the country; and Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they will kill me, and keep thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the woman was taken into the house of Pharao.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen, and he asses, and menservants and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now therefore, there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and they led him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
