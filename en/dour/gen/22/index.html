And he answered: Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision: and there thou shalt offer him for a holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will show thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass: and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the holocaust he went his way to the place which God had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass: I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son: and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they two went on together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Isaac said to his father: My father. And he answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the holocaust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they came to the place which God had shown him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it: and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he put forth his hand and took the sword, to sacrifice his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth. Whereupon even to this day it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the seashore: thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After these things, it was told Abraham that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hus the firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and Jedlaph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca: These eight did Melcha bear to Nachor Abraham's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his concubine, named Roma, bore Tabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
