They answered: Of Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he asked them, saying: Know you Laban the son of Nachor? They said: We know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say they: and behold Rachel his daughter cometh with his flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jacob said: There is yet much day remaining, neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again: first give the sheep drink, and so lead them back to feed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle be gathered together, and we remove the stone from the well's mouth, that we may water the flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when Jacob saw her, and knew her to be his cousin-german, and that they were the sheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone wherewith the well was closed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And having watered the flock, he kissed her: and lifting up his voice, wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he told her that he was her father's brother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went in haste and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's son was come, ran forth to meet him; and embracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought him into his house. And when he had heard the causes of his journey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the days of one month were expired,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to him: Because thou art my brother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell me what wages thou wilt have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now he had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lia: and the younger was called Richel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Lia was blear eyed: Rachel was well favoured, and of a beautiful countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob being in love with her, said: I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lahan answered: It is better that I give her thee than to another man; stay with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel: and they seemed but a few days, because of the greatness of his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to Laban: Give me my wife; for now the time is fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he, having invited a great number of his friends to the feast, made the marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And at night he brought in Lia his daughter to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Giving his daughter a handmaid, named Zalpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom when morning was come he saw it was Lia:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to his father in law: What is it that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Laban answered: It is not the custom in this place, to give the younger in marriage first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Make up the week of days of this match: and I will give thee her also, for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past, he married Rachel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To whom her father gave Bala for her servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And having at length obtained the marriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and served with him other seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw my affliction: now my husband will love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And again she conceived and bore a son, and said: Because the Lord heard that I was despised, he hath given this also to me: and she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived the third time, and bore another son: and said: Now also my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called hi sname Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and said: now will I praise the Lord: and for this she called him Juda. And she left bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
