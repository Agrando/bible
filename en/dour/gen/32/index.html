With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him: lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten of their foals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau: and he cometh after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In like manner he commanded the second and the third, and all that followed with the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And ye shall add: thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us: for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And rising early he took his two wives, and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He remained alone: and behold a man wrestled with him till morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered: I will not let thee go except thou bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said: What is thy name? He answered: Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel: for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jacob asked him, Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
