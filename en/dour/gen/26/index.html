He answered: I feared lest I should die for her sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said: Why hadst thou deceived us? Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin. And he commanded all the people, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family. Wherefore the Palestines envying him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father Abraham had digged, filling them up with earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he departed and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father Abraham had digged, and which, after his death, the Palestines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names by which his father before had called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they digged in the torrent, and found living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they digged also another; and for that they quarreled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they contended not: therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from that place to Bersabee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Where the Lord appeared to him that same might, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father; do not fear, for I am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent: and commanded his servants to dig a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers came from Gerara,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee: but with peace have sent thee away increased with the blessing of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Arising in the morning, they swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And behold the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him of a well which they had digged, and saying: We have found water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the name of the city was called Bersabee, even to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hethite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon of the same place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
