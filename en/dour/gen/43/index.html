For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought Simeon out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Joseph came into his house, and they offered him the presents holding them in their hands, and they bowed down with their face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he, courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom uou told me? Is he yet living?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered: Thy servant our father is in health, he is yet living. And bowing themselves they made obeisance to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin his brother, by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he made haste becouse his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: And going into his chamber he wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him, apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
