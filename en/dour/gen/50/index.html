So I will go up and bury my father, and return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the house of Joseph with his brethren, except their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in the land of Gessen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He had also in his train chariots and horsemen: and it was it great company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan: where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this, they said: This is a great mourning to the Egyptians. And there- fore the name of that place was called, The mourning of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And carrying him into the land of Chanaan, they buried him in the double cave which Abraham had bought together with the held for a possession of a buryingplace, of Ephron the Hethite over against Mambre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another : Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before he died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That we should say thus much to thee from him: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the sin and malice they practiced against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his brethren came to him: and worshipping prostrate on the ground they said: We are thy servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the will of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You thought evil against me: but God turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fear not: I will feed you and your children. And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's house: and lived a hundred and ten years. And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Ma-nasses were born on Joseph's knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After which he told his brethren: God will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he made them swear to him, saying: God will visit you, Carry my bones with you out of this place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he died being a hundred and ten years old. And being embalmed he was laid in a coffin in Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
