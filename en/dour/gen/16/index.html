And when he agreed to her request,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he went in to her. But she, perceiving that she was with child, despised her mistress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child, despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use her its it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai afflicted her, she ran away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel of the Lord having found her, by a fountain of water in the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur in the desert,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she answered: I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men, and all men's hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen me. For she said: Verily here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore she called that well, The well of him that liveth and seeth me. The same is between Cades and Bared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his name Ismael.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Abram was fourscore and six years old when Agar brought him forth Ismael.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
