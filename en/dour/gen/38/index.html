She went her way and dwelt in her father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after many days were past, the daughter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he had taken comfort after his mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hiras the Odollamite the shepherd of his flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was told Thamar that her father in law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she put off the garments of her widowhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been married to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>dummy verses inserted by amos</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she should be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge ? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore at one copulation conceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman: but he, not finding her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>asked the men of that place : Where is the woman that sat in the cross way? And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Juda said : Let her take it to herself ; surely she cannot charge us with a,lie: I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold after three months they told a lie, saying: Thamar, thy daughter in law hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly. And Juda said : Bring her out that she may be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>dummy verses inserted by amos</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This shall come forth the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread: and she called him Zara.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
