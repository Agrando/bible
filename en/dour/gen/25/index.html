And she went to consult the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he answering said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau.
