And do they belong to thee? He answered: They are the children which God hath given to me thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the handmaids and their children came near, and bowed themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lia also with her children came near, and bowed down in like manner, and last of all Joseph and Rachel bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Esau said: What are the droves that I met? He answered: That I might find favor before my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favor in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of God: be gracious to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And take the blessing, which I have brought thee, and which God hath given me, who giveth all things. He took it with much ado at his brother's earnest pressing him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And said: Let us go on together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>May it please my lord to go before his servant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some of the people at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said: There is no necessity: I want nothing else but only to find favor, my lord, in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Esau returned, that day, the way that he came, to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jacob came to Socoth: where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he passed over to Salem, a city of the Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the town:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he bought that part of the field, in which he pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of Sichem for a hundred lambs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And raising an altar there, he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
