Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Of the sons of Sechenias, the son of Pharos, Zacharias, and with him were numbered a hundred and fifty men.</span> <span

Zachur, and with them seventy men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I gathered them together to the river, which runneth down to Ahava, and we stayed there three days: and I sought among the people and among the priests for the sons of Levi, and found none there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Semeias, and Elnathan, and Jarib, and another Elnathan, and Nathan, and Zacharias, and Mosollam, chief men: and Joiarib, and Elnathan, wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I sent them to Eddo, who is chief in the place of Chasphia, and I put in their mouth the words that they should speak to Eddo, and his brethren the Nathinites in the place of Chasphia, that they should bring us ministers of the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a most learned man of the sons of Moholi the son of Levi the son of Israel, and Sarabias and his sons, and his brethren eighteen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hasabias, and with him Isaias of the sons of Merari, and his brethren, and his sons twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And of the Nathinites, whom David, and the princes gave for the service of the Levites, Nathinites two hundred and twenty: all these were called by their names.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I proclaimed there a fast by the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before the Lord our God, and might ask of him a right way for us and for our children, and for all our substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I was ashamed to ask the king for aid and for horsemen, to defend us from the enemy in the way: because we had said to the king: The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him in goodness: and his power and strength, and wrath upon all them that forsake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And we fasted, and besought our God for this: and it fell out prosperously unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sarabias, and Hasabias, and with them ten of their brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I weighed unto them the silver and gold, and the vessels consecrated for the house of our God, which the king and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel, that were found had offered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I weighed to their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred vessels of silver, and a hundred talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And twenty cups of gold, of a thousand solids, and two vessels of the best shining brass, beautiful as gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I said to them: You are the holy ones of the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and gold, that is freely offered to the Lord the God of our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Watch ye and beep them, till you deliver them by weight before the chief of the priests, and of the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, into the treasure of the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and gold, and the vessels, to carry them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then we set forward from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And on the fourth day the silver and the gold, and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Urias the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabad the son of Josue, and Noadaia the son of Benoi, Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>According to the number and weight of every thing: and all the weight was written at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Moreover the children of them that had been carried away that were come out of the captivity, offered holocausts to the God of Israel, twelve calves for all the people of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy- seven lambs, and twelve he goats for sin: all for a holocaust to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they gave the king's edicts to the lords that were from the king's court, and the governors beyond the river, and they furthered the people and the house of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
