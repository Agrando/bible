The candlestick shall stand with its lamps,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the altar of gold whereon the incense is burnt, before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And before it the altar of holocaust:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The laver between the altar and the tabernacle, and thou shalt fill it with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and the entry thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be sanctified:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The altar of holocaust and all its vessels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The laver with its foot: thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction, that they may be most holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments, that they may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it to fulfil the commandment of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the north side without the veil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony over against the table on the south side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony over against the veil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the altar of holocaust of the entry of the testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it, as the Lord had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses and Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and went to the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof.
