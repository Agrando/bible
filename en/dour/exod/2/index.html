And when she saw the basket in the sedges, she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the child's sister said to her Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pharao's daughter said to her. Take this child and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took, and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarreling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us: wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
