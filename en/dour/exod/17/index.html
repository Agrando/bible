And Moses answered them: Why chide you with me? Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So the people were thirsty there for want of water, and murmured against Moses, saying: Why didst thou make us go forth out of Egypt, to kill us and our children, and our beasts with thirst?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: What shall I do to this people? Yet a little more and they will stone me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord said to Moses: God before the people, and take with thee of the ancients of Israel: and take in thy hand the rod wherewith thou didst strike the river, and go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold I will stand there before thee, upon the rock Horeb: and thou shalt strike the rock, and water shall come out of it that the people may drink.
