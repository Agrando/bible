And when he was come into the tent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moses told his kinsman all that the Lord had done to Pharao, and the Egyptians, in favour of Israel: and all the labour which had befallen them in the journey, and that the Lord had delivered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jethro rejoiced for all the good things that the Lord had done to Israel, because he had delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said: Blessed is the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of Pharao, and out of the hand of the Egyptians, who hath delivered his people out of the hand of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now I know that the Lord is great above all gods: because they dealt proudly against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jethro the kinsman of Moses offered holocausts and sacrifices to God: and Aaron and all the ancients of Israel came, to eat bread with them before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the next day Moses sat, to judge the people, who stood by Moses from morning until night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when his kinsman had seen all things that he did among the people, he said: What is it that thou dost among the people? Why sittest thou alone, and all the people wait from morning till night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses answered him: The people come to me to seek the judgment of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when any controversy falleth out among them, they come to me to judge between them, and to shew the precepts of God, and his laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said: The thing thou dost is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou are spent with foolish labour, both thou and this people that is with thee: the business is above thy strength, thou alone canst not bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But hear my words and counsels, and God shall be with thee. Be thou to the people in those things that pertain to God, to bring their words to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to shew the people the ceremonies and the manner of worshipping, and the way wherein they ought to walk, and the work that they ought to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, in whom there is truth, and that hate avarice, and appoint of them rulers of thousands, and of hundreds, and of fifties, and of tens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who may judge the people at all times: and when any great matter soever shall fall out, let them refer it to thee, and let them judge the lesser matters only: that so it may be lighter for thee, the burden being shared out unto others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou dost this, thou shalt fulfil the commandment of God, and shalt be able to bear his precepts: and all this people shall return to their places with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Moses heard this, he did all things that he had suggested unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And choosing able men out of all Israel, he appointed them rulers of the people, rulers over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they judged the people at all times: and whatsoever was of greater difficulty they referred to him, and they judged the easier cases only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he let his kinsman depart: and he returned and went into his own country.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
