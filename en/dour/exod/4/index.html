He answered: A rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses fled from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord said to him: Who made man's mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go therefore and I will be in thy mouth: and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said: I beseech thee, Lord send whom thou wilt send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Lord being angry at Moses, said Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee shall be glad at heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and will shew you what you must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt: for they are all dead that sought thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass: and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the fore skin of her son, and touched his feet and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he let him go after she had said A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel: and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
