Those are the words thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moses came, and calling together the elders of the people, he declared all the words which the Lord had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people answered together: All that the Lord hath spoken, we will do. And when Moses had related the people's words to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord said to him: Lo, now will I come to thee in the darkness of a cloud, that the people may hear me speaking to thee, and may believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to him: Go to the people, and sanctify them to day, and to morrow, and let them wash their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And let them be ready against the third day: for on the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people round about, and thou shalt say to them: Take heed you go not up into the mount, and that ye touch not the borders thereof: every one that toucheth the mount dying he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No hands shall touch him, but he shall be stoned to death, or shall be shot through with arrows: whether it be beast, or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet shall begin to sound, then let them go up into the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses came down from the mount to the people, and sanctified them. And when they had washed their garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them: Be ready against the third day, and come not near your wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now the third day was come, and the morning appeared: and behold thunders began to be heard, and lightning to flash, and a very thick cloud to cover the mount, and the noise of the trumpet sounded exceeding loud, and the people that was in the camp, feared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Moses had brought them forth to meet God from the place of the camp, they stood at the bottom of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all mount Sinai was on a smoke: because the Lord was come down upon it in fire, and the smoke arose from it as out of a furnace: and all the mount was terrible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sound of the trumpet grew by degrees louder and louder, and was drawn out to a greater length: Moses spoke, and God answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, in the very top of the mount, and he called Moses unto the top thereof. And when he was gone up thither,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said unto him: Go down, and charge the people: lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the Lord, and a very great multitude of them should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The priests also that come to the Lord, let them be sanctified, lest he strike them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said to the Lord: The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou did charge, and command, saying: Set limits about the mount, and sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Lord said to him: Go, get thee down: and thou shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people pass the limits, nor come up to the Lord, lest he kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses went down to the people and told them all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
