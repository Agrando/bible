Horns shall go out of the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold, as well as the grate thereof, as the walls round about and the horns. And thou shalt make to it a crown of gold round about,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And two golden rings under the crown on either side, that the bars may be put into them, and the altar be carried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And thou shalt make the bars also of setim wood, and shalt overlay them with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou shalt set the altar over against the veil, that hangeth before the ark of the testimony before the propitiatory wherewith the testimony is covered, where I will speak to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Aaron shall burn sweet smelling incense upon it in the morning. When he shall dress the lamps, he shall burn it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he shall place them in the evening, he shall burn an everlasting incense before the Lord throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You shall not offer upon it incense of another composition nor oblation, and victim, neither shall you offer libations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Aaron shall pray upon the horns thereof once a year, with the blood of that which was offered for sin, and shall make atonement upon it in your generations. It shall be most holy to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When thou shalt take the sum of the children of Israel according to their number, every one of them shall give a price for their souls to the Lord, and there shall be no scourge among them, when they shall be reckoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this shall every one give that passeth at the naming, half a sicle according to the standard of the temple. A sicle hath twenty obols. Half a sicle shall be offered to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He that is counted in the number from twenty years and upwards, shall give the price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The rich man shall not add to half a sicle, and the poor man shall diminish nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the money received which was contributed by the children of Israel, thou shalt deliver unto the uses of the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be a memorial of them before the Lord, and he may be merciful to their souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shalt make also a brazen laver with its foot, to wash in: and thou shalt set it between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar. And water being put into it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet in it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they are going into the tabernacle of the testimony, and when they are to come to the altar, to offer on it incense to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Lest perhaps they die.
