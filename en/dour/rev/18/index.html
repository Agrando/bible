alas! that great city, which was clothed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and was gilt with gold, and precious stones, and pearls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in one hour are so great riches come to nought; and every shipmaster, and all that sail into the lake, and mariners, and as many as work in the sea, stood afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And cried, seeing the place of her burning, saying: What city is like to this great city?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying: Alas! alas! that great city, wherein all were made rich, that had ships at sea, by reason of her prices: for in one hour she is made desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a mighty angel took up a stone, as it were a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying: With such violence as this shall Babylon, that great city, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the voice of harpers, and of musicians, and of them that play on the pipe, and on the trumpet, shall no more be heard at all in thee; and no craftsman of any art whatsoever shall be found any more at all in thee; and the sound of the mill shall be heard no more at all in thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, for all nations have been deceived by thy enchantments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
