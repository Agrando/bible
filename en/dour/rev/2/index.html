Or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou do penance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaites, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To him, that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead, and is alive:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art rich: and thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried: and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful until death: and I will give thee the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write: These things, saith he, that hath the sharp two edged sword:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith. Even in those days when Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have against thee a few things: because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat, and to commit fornication:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In like manner do penance: if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To him that overcometh, I will give the hidden manna, and will give him a white counter, and in the counter, a new name written, which no man knoweth, but he that receiveth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to the angel of the church of Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like to a flame of fire, and his feet like to fine brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know thy works, and thy faith, and thy charity, and thy ministry, and thy patience, and thy last works which are more than the former.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have against thee a few things: because thou sufferest the woman Jezabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach, and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication, and to eat of things sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave her a time that she might do penance, and she will not repent of her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I will cast her into a bed: and they that commit adultery with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do penance from their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works.
