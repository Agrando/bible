Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the whole world was enlightened with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But over them only was spread a heavy night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
