or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall come before thee to be a revenger of wicked men? or who shall accuse thee, if the nations perish, which thou hast made?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For there is no other God but thou, who hast care of all, that thou shouldst shew that thou dost not give judgment unjustly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Neither shall king, nor tyrant in thy sight inquire about them whom thou hast destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For so much then as thou art just, thou orderest all things justly: thinking it not agreeable to thy power, to condemn him who deserveth not to be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thy power is the beginning of justice: and because thou art Lord of all, thou makest thyself gracious to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thou shewest thy power, when men will not believe thee to be absolute in power, and thou convincest the boldness of them that know thee not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But thou being master of power, judgest with tranquillity; and with great favour disposest of us: for thy power is at hand when thou wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But thou hast taught thy people by such works, that they must be just and humane, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope: because in judging thou givest place for repentance for sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy servants, and that deserved to die, with so great deliberation, giving them time and place whereby they might be changed from their wickedness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>With what circumspection hast thou judged thy own children, to whose parents thou hast sworn and made covenants of good promises?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore whereas thou chastisest us, thou scourgest our enemies very many ways, to the end that when we judge we may think on thy goodness: and when we are judged, we may hope for thy mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Wherefore thou hast also greatly tormented them who in their life have lived foolishly and unjustly, by the same things which they worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For they went astray for a long time in the ways of error, holding those things for gods which are the most worthless among beasts, living after the manner of children without understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore thou hast sent a judgment upon them as senseless children to mock them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But they that were not amended by mockeries and reprehensions, experienced the worthy judgment of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For seeing with indignation that they suffered by those very things which they took for gods, when they were destroyed by the same, they acknowledged him the true God, whom in time past they denied that they knew: for which cause the end also of their condemnation came upon them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
