and it because being frail it is called a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But to God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For that which is made, together with him that made it, shall suffer torments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore there shall be no respect had even to the idols of the Gentiles: because the creatures of God are turned to an abomination, and a temptation to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the beginning of fornication is the devising of idols: and the invention of them is the corruption of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by the vanity of men they came into the world: and therefore they shall be found to come shortly to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a father being afflicted with bitter grief, made to himself the image of his son who was quickly taken away: and him who then had died as a man, he began now to worship as a god, and appointed him rites and sacrifices among his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then in process of time, wicked custom prevailing, this error was kept as a law, and statues were worshipped by the commandment of tyrants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And those whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they brought their resemblance from afar, and made an express image of the king whom they had a mind to honour: that by this their diligence, they might honour as present, him that was absent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to worshipping of these, the singular diligence also of the artificer helped to set forward the ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he being willing to please him that employed him, laboured with all his art to make the resemblance in the best manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the multitude of men, carried away by the beauty of the work, took him now for a god that a little before was but honoured as a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this was the occasion of deceiving human life: for men serving either their affection, or their kings, gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of God, but whereas they lived in a great war of ignorance, they call so many and so great evils peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For either they sacrifice their own children, or use hidden sacrifices, or keep watches full of madness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that now they neither keep life, nor marriage undefiled, but one killeth another through envy, or grieveth him by adultery:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all things are mingled together, blood, murder, theft and dissimulation, corruption and unfaithfulness, tumults and perjury, disquieting of the good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Forgetfulness of God, defiling of souls, changing of nature, disorder in marriage, and the irregularity of adultery and uncleaness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the worship of abominable idols is the cause, and the beginning and end of all evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For either they are mad when they are merry: or they prophesy lies, or they live unjustly, or easily forswear themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whilst they trust in idols, which are without life, though they swear amiss, they look not to be hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But for two things they shall be justly punished, because they have thought not well of God, giving heed to idols, and have sworn unjustly, in guile despising justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For it is not the power of them, by whom they swear, but the just vengeance of sinners always punisheth the transgression of the unjust.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
