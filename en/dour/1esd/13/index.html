For they perhaps err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For being conversant among his works, they search: and they are persuaded that the things are good which are seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But then again they are not to be pardoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For if they were able to know so much as to make a judgment of the world: how did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But unhappy are they, and their hope is among the dead, who have called gods the works of the hands of men, gold and silver, the inventions of art, and the resemblances of beasts, or an unprofitable stone the work of an ancient hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Or if an artist, a carpenter, hath cut down a tree proper for his use in the wood, and skilfully taken off all the bark thereof, and with his art, diligently formeth a vessel profitable for the common uses of life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And useth the chips of his work to dress his meat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And taking what was left thereof, which is good for nothing, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, carveth it diligently when he hath nothing else to do, and by the skill of his art fashioneth it and maketh it like the image of a man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Or the resemblance of some beast, laying it over with vermillion, and painting it red, and covering every spot that is in it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And maketh a convenient dwelling place for it, and setting it in a wall, and fastening it with iron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Providing for it, lest it should fall, knowing that it is unable to help itself: for it is an image, and hath need of help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And then maketh prayer to it, inquiring concerning his substance, and his children, or his marriage. And he is not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And for health he maketh suspplication to the weak, and for life prayeth to that which is dead, and for help calleth upon that which is unprofitable:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And for a good journey he petitioneth him that cannot walk: and for getting, and for working, and for the event of all things he asketh him that is unable to do any thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
