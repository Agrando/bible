For no man can make a god like to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For being mortal himself, he formeth a dead thing with his wicked hands. For he is better than they whom he worshippeth, because he indeed hath lived, though he were mortal, but they never.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover they worship also the vilest creatures: but things without sense compared to these, are worse than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, neither by sight can any man see good of these beasts. But they have fled from the praise of God, and from his blessing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
