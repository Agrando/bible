which they that use, become the friends of God, being commended for the gift of discipline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God hath given to me to speak as I would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the knowledge and skill of works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are: to know the disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their courses, and the changes of seasons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The revolutions of the year, and the dispositions of the stars,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all such things as are hid and not foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For in her is the spirit of understanding: holy, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all things, and containing all spirits, intelligible, pure, subtile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For wisdom is more active than all active things: and reacheth everywhere by reason of her purity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For she is a vapour of the power of God, and a certain pure emanation of the glory of the almighty God: and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of God's majesty, and the image of his goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For after this cometh night, but no evil can overcome wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
