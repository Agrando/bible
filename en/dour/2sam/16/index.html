And Siba answered: The asses are for the king's household to sit on: and the loaves and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine to drink if any man be faint in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said: Where is thy master's son? And Siba answered the king: He remained in Jerusalem, saying: To day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said to Siba: I give thee all that belonged to Miphiboseth. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find grace before thee, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And king David came as far as Bahurim: and behold there came out from thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul named Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he cursed as he went on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the right, and on the left side of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus said Semei when he cursed the king: Come out, come out, thou man of blood, and thou man of Belial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house of Saul: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and the Lord hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold thy evils press upon thee, because thou art a man of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abisai the son of Sarvia said to the king: Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will go, and cut off his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? Let him alone and let him curse: for the Lord hath bid him curse David: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants: Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now a son of Jemini? let him alone that he may curse as the Lord hath bidden him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Perhaps the Lord may look upon my affliction, and the Lord may render me good for the cursing of this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David and his men with him went by the way. And Semei by the hill's side went over against him, cursing, and casting stones at him, and scattering earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king and all the people with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Absalom and all his people came into Jerusalem, and Achitophel was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Chusai the Arachite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, he said to him: God save thee, O king, God save thee, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Absalom said to him: Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Chusai answered Absalom: Nay: for I will be his, whom the Lord hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with him will I abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king's son? as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we are to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Achitophel said to Absalom: Go in to the concubines of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may be strengthened with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and he went in to his father's concubines before all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the counsel of Achitophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man should consult God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel, both when he was with David, and when he was with Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
