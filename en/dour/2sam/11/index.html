And it was told him, that she was Bethsabee the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Urias the Hethite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David sent messengers, and took her, and she came in to him, and he slept with her: and presently she was purified from her uncleanness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she returned to her house having conceived. And she sent and told David, and said: I have conceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David sent to Joab, saying: Send me Urias the Hethite. And Joab sent Urias to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Urias came to David. And David asked how Joab did, and the people, and how the war was carried on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Urias: Go into thy house, and wash thy feet. And Urias went out from the king's house, and there went out after him a mess of meat from the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Urias slept before the gate of the king's house, with the other servants of his lord, and went not down to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it was told David by some that said: Urias went not to his house. And David said to Urias: Didst thou not come from thy journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Urias said to David: The ark of God and Israel and Juda dwell in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord abide upon the face of the earth: and shall I go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to sleep with my wife? By thy welfare and by the welfare of thy soul I will not do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then David said to Urias: Tarry here to day, and to morrow I will send thee away. Urias tarried in Jerusalem that day and the next.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David called him to eat and to drink before him, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening, and slept on his couch with the servants of his lord, and went not down into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the morning was come, David wrote a letter to Joab: and sent it by the hand of Urias,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Writing in the letter: Set ye Urias in the front of the battle, where the fight is strongest: and leave ye him, that he may be wounded and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wherefore as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in the place where he knew the bravest men were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men coming out of the city, fought against Joab, and there fell some of the people of the servants of David, and Urias the Hethite was killed also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Joab sent, and told David all things concerning the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he charged the messenger, saying: When thou hast told all the words of the battle to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If thou see him to be angry, and he shall say: Why did you approach so near to the wall to fight? knew you not that many darts are thrown from above off the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, and slew him in Thebes? Why did you go near the wall? Thou shalt say: Thy servant Urias the Hethite is also slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the messenger departed, and came and told David all that Joab had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the messenger said to David: The men prevailed against us, and they came out to us into the field: and we vigorously charged and pursued them even to the gate of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants from off the wall above: and some of the king's servants are slain, and thy servant Urias the Hethite is also dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David said to the messenger: Thus shalt thou say to Joab: Let not this thing discourage thee: for various is the event of war: and sometimes one, sometimes another is consumed by the sword: encourage thy warriors against The city, and exhort them that thou mayest overthrow it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the mourning being over, David sent and brought her into his house, and she became his wife, and she bore him a son: and this thing which David had done, was displeasing to the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
