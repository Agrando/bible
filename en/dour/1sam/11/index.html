And all the men of Jabes said to Naas: Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Naas the Ammonite answered them: On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may pluck out all your right eyes, and make you a reproach in all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the ancients of Jabes said to him: Allow us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the coasts of Israel: and if there be no one to defend us, we will come out to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The messengers therefore came to Gabaa of Saul: and they spoke these words in the hearing of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold Saul came, following oxen out of the field, and he said: What aileth the people that they weep?

And the fear of the Lord fell upon the people, and they went out as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he numbered them in Bezec: and there were of the children of Israel three hundred thousand: and of the men of Juda thirty thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to the messengers that came: Thus shall you say to the men of Jabes Galaad: Tomorrow, when the sun shall be hot, you shall have relief. The messengers therefore came, and told the men of Jabes: and they were glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said: In the morning we will come out to you: and you shall do what you please with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when the morrow was come that Saul put the people in three companies: and he came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and he slew the Ammonites until the day grew hot, and the rest were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the people said to Samuel: Who is he that said: Shall Saul reign over us?
