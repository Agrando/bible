And Samuel prayed to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee. For they have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According to all their works, they have done from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day: as they have forsaken me, and served strange gods, so do they also unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now therefore hearken to their voice: but yet testify to them, and foretell them the right of the king, that shall reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people that had desired a king of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And said: This will be the right of the king, that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and will make them his horsemen, and his running footmen to run before his chariots,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will appoint of them to be his tribunes, and centurions, and to plough his fields, and to reap his corn, and to make him arms and chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your daughters also he will take to make him ointments, and to be his cooks, and bakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your best oliveyards, and give them to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover he will take the tenth of your corn, and of the revenues of your vineyards, to give his eunuchs and servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your servants also and handmaids, and your goodliest young men, and your asses he will take away, and put them to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your flocks also he will tithe, and you shall be his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall cry out in that day from the face of the king, whom you have chosen to yourselves. and the Lord will not hear you in that day, because you desired unto yourselves a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel, and they said: Nay: but there shall be a king over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we also will be like all nations: and our king shall judge us, and go out before us, and tight our battles for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel: Let every man go to his city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
