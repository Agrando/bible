And when there shall be a white colour in the skin, and it shall have changed the look of the hair, and the living flesh itself shall appear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It shall be judged an inveterate leprosy, and grown into the skin. The priest therefore shall declare him unclean, and shall not shut him up, because he is evidently unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if the leprosy spring out running about in the skin, and cover all the skin from the head to the feet, whatsoever falleth under the sight of the eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The priest shall view him, and shall judge that the leprosy which he has is very clean: because it is all turned into whiteness, and therefore the man shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the live flesh shall appear in him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled, and shall be reckoned among the unclean: for live flesh, if it be spotted with leprosy, is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if again it be turned into whiteness, and cover all the man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The priest shall view him, and shall judge him to be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When also there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin, and it has been healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in the place of the ulcer, there appeareth a white scar, or somewhat red, the man shall be brought to the priest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other flesh, and the hair turned white, he shall declare him unclean, for the plague of leprosy is broken out in the ulcer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the hair be of the former colour, and the scar somewhat obscure, and be not lower than the flesh that is near it, he shall shut him up seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if it spread, he shall judge him to have the leprosy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if it stay in its place, it is but the scar of an ulcer, and the man shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The flesh also and skin that hath been burnt, and after it is healed hath a white or a red scar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The priest shall view it, and if he see it turned white, and the place thereof is lower than the other skin: he shall declare him unclean, because the evil of leprosy is broken out in the scar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the colour of the hair be not changed, nor the blemish lower than the other flesh, and the appearance of the leprosy be somewhat obscure, he shall shut him up seven days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And on the seventh day he shall view him: if the leprosy be grown farther in the skin, he shall declare him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if the whiteness stay in its place, and be not very clear, it is the sore of a burning, and therefore he shall be cleansed, because it is only the scar of a burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a man or woman, the Priest shall see them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if the place be lower than the other flesh, and the hair yellow, and thinner than usual: he shall declare them unclean, because it is the leprosy of the head and the beard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh that is near it, and the hair black: he shall shut him up seven days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And on the seventh day he shall look upon it. If the spot be not grown, and the hair keep its colour, and the place of the blemish be even with the other flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The man shall be shaven all but the place of the spot, and he shall be shut up other seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If on the seventh day the evil seem to have stayed in its place, and not lower than the other flesh, he shall cleanse him, and his clothes being washed he shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow, because he is evidently unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if the spot be stayed, and the hair be black, let him know that the man is healed, and let him confidently pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If a whiteness appear in the skin of a man or a woman,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The priest shall view them. If he find that a darkish whiteness shineth in the skin, let him know that it is not the leprosy, but a white blemish, and that the man is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The man whose hair falleth off from his head, he is bald and clean:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if the hair fall from his forehead, he is bald before and clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But if in the bald head or in the bald forehead there be risen a white or reddish colour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the priest perceive this, he shall condemn him undoubtedly of leprosy which is risen in the bald part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now whosoever shall be defiled with the leprosy, and is separated by the judgment of the priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Shall have his clothes hanging loose, his head bare, his mouth covered with a cloth, and he shall cry out that he is defiled and unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>All the time that he is a leper and unclean, he shall dwell alone without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>A woollen or linen garment that shall have the leprosy</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>In the warp, and the woof, or a skin. or whatsoever is made of a skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>If it be infected with a white or red spot, it shall be accounted the leprosy, and shall be shewn to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall look upon it and shall shut it up seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And on the seventh day when he looketh on it again, if he find that it if grown, it is a Axed leprosy: he shall judge the garment unclean, and every thing wherein it shall be found:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And therefore it shall be burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But if he see that it is not grown,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He shall give orders, and they shall wash that part wherein the leprosy is, and he shall shut it up other seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when he shall see that the former colour is not returned, nor yet the leprosy spread, he shall judge it unclean, and shall burn it with fire, for the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the garment, or through the whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark, after the garment is washed, he shall tear it off, and divide it from that which is sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And if after this there appear in those places that before were without spot, a flying and wandering leprosy: it must be burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If it cease, he shall wash with water the parts that are pure, the second time, and they shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This is the law touching the leprosy of any woollen or linen garment, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins, how it ought to be cleansed, or pronounced unclean.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
