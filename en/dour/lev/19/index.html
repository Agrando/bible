Keep my sabbaths. I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Turn ye not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods. I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If ye offer in sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord, that he may be favourable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall eat it on the same day it was offered, and the next day: and whatsoever shall be left until the third day, you shall burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If after two days ally man eat thereof, he shall be profane and guilty of impiety:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And shall bear his iniquity, because he hath defiled the holy thing of the Lord, and that soul shall perish from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When thou reapest the corn of thy land, thou shalt not cut down all that is on the face of the earth to the very ground: nor shalt thou gather the ears that remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Neither shalt thou gather the bunches and grapes that fall down in thy vineyard, but shalt leave them to the poor and the strangers to take. I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall not steal.

Respect not the person of the poor, nor honour the countenance of the mighty. But judge thy neighbour according to justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou shalt not be a detractor nor a whisperer among the people. Thou shalt not stand against the blood of thy neighbour.

I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If a stranger dwell in your land, and abide among you, do not upbraid him :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But let him be among you as one of the same country: and you shall love him as yourselves: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do not any unjust thing in judgment, in rule, in weight, or in measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Let the balance be just and the weights equal, the bushel just, and the sextary equal. I am the Lord your God, that brought you out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Keep all my precepts, and all my judgments, and do them.
