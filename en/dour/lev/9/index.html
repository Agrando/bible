And after the fat was burnt upon the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Aaron separated their breasts, and the right shoulders, elevating them before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And stretching forth his hands to the people, he blessed them. And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace offerings being finished, he came down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
