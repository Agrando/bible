Every man shall return to his possession, and every one shall go back to his former family:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year. You shall not sow, nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord, neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because of the sanctification of the jubilee: but as they grow you shall presently eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour, or shalt buy of him; grieve not thy brother: but thou shalt buy of him according to the number of years from the jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The more years remain after the jubilee, the more shall the price increase: and the less time is counted, so much the less shall the purchase cost.

But oppress not your brethren the children of Israel by might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If the hand of a stranger or a sojourner grow strong among you, and thy brother being impoverished sell himself to him, or to any of his race:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>After the sale he may be redeemed. He that will of his brethren shall redeem him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, or his kinsman, by blood, or by affinity. But if he himself be able also, he shall redeem himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Counting only the years from the time of his selling unto the year of the jubilee: and counting the money that he was sold for, according to the number of the years and the reckoning of a hired servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there be many years that remain until the jubilee, according to them shall he also repay the price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>If few, he shall make the reckoning with him according to the number of the years, and shall repay to the buyer of what remaineth of the years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>His wages being allowed for which he served before: he shall not afflict him violently in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if by these means he cannot be redeemed, in the year of the jubilee he shall go out with his children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For the children of Israel are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
