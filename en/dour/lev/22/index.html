I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Say to them and to their posterity: Every man of your race, that approacheth to those things that are consecrated, and which the children of Israel have offered to the Lord, in whom there is uncleanness, shall perish before the Lord. I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The man of the seed of Aaron, that is a leper, or that suffereth a running of the seed, shall not eat of those things that are sanctified to me, until he be healed. He that toucheth any thing unclean by occasion of the dead, and he whose seed goeth from him as in generation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he that toucheth a creeping thing, or any unclean thing, the touching of which is defiling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Shall be unclean until the evening, and shall not eat those things that are sanctified: but when he hath washed his flesh with water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the sun is down, then being purified, he shall eat of the sanctified things, because it is his meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That which dieth of itself, and that which was taken by a beast, they shall not eat, nor be defiled therewith, I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let them keep my precepts, that they may not fall into sin, and die in the sanctuary, when they shall have defiled it. I am the Lord who sanctify them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>No stranger shall eat of the sanctified things: a sojourner of the priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he whom the priest hath bought, and he that is his servant, born in his house, these shall eat of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If the daughter of a priest be married to any of the people, she shall not eat of those things that are sanctified, nor of the firstfruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if she be a widow, or divorced, and having no children return to her father's house, she shall eat of her father's meats, as she was wont to do when she was a maid, no stranger hath leave to eat of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He that eateth of the sanctified things through ignorance, shall add the fifth part with that which he ate, and shall give it to the priest into the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they shall not profane the sanctified things of the children of Israel, which they offer to the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lest perhaps they bear the iniquity of their trespass, when they shall have eaten the sanctified things.
