Or what hast thou that thou hast not received ? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable, but we without honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And we labour, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you as my dearest children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord; who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus; as I teach every where in every church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What will you ? shall I come to you with a rod; or in charity, and in the spirit of meekness ?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
