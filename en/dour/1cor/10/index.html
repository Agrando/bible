And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The chalice of benediction, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we, being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold Israel according to the flesh: are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What then ? Do I say, that what is offered in sacrifice to idols, is any thing ? Or, that the idol is any thing ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no man seek his own, but that which is another's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat; asking no question for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you will be willing to go; eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the other's. For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Be without offence to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the church of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
