Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I baptized also the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the base things of the world, and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That no flesh should glory in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That, as it is written: He that glorieth, may glory in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
