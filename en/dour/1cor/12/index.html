And no man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>To another, faith in the same spirit; to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the body also is not one member, but many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if the ear should say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they all were one member, where would be the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body, are more necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That there might be no schism in the body; but the members might be mutually careful one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
