As unto little ones in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men ? What then is Apollo, and what is Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, ate one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are God's coadjutors: you are God's husbandry; you are God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Every man's work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man's work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Let no man therefore glory in men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to some; for all are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
