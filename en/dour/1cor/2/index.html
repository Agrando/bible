For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that we may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
