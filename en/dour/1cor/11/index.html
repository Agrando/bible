But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not ? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore are there many inform and weak among you, and many sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
