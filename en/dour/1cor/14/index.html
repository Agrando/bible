Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said ? For you shall be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world; and none is without voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian; and he that speaketh, a barbarian to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing ? because he knoweth not what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but to believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How is it then, brethren ? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn, and all may be exhorted:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or did the word of God come out from you ? Or came it only unto you ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any seem to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any man know not, he shall not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But let all things be done decently, and according to order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
