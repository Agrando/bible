And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Know you not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things of this world ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge, who are the most despised in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man, that is able to judge between his brethren ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you do wrong and defraud, and that to your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such some of you were; but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meat for the belly, and the belly for the meats; but God shall destroy both it and them: but the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or know you not, that he who is joined to a harlot, is made one body ? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or know you not, that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God; and you are not your own ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
