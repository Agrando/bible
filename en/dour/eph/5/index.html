For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Proving what is well pleasing to God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
