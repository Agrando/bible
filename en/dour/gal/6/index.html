For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not failing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For neither they themselves who are circumcised, keep the law; but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me; for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren.
