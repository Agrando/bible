If it be yet in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man's testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
