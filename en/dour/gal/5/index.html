Then is the scandal of the cross made void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the spirit serve one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another; take heed you be not consumed one of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they that are Christ's, have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying on another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
