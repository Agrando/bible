And if a son, an heir also through God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You observe days, and months, and times, and years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
