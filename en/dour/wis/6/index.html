And not only these, but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time, I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible learning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore I thought it good, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book; and with much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the law of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
