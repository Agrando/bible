our God hath made good his word, that he spoke to us, and to our judges that have judged Israel, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to all Israel and Juda:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In the fifth year, in the seventh day of the month, at the time that the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That the Lord would bring upon us great evils, such as never happened under heaven, as they have come to pass in Jerusalem, according to the things that are written in the law of Moses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Baruch read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joakim king of Juda, and in the hearing of all the people that came to hear the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in the hearing of the nobles, the sons of the kings, and in the hearing of the ancients, and in the hearing of the people, from the least even to the greatest of them that dwelt in Babylonia, by the river Sedi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he hath delivered them up to be under the hand of all the kings that are round about us, to be a reproach, and desolation among all the people, among whom the Lord hath scattered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when they heard it they wept, and fasted, and prayed before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And we are brought under, and are not uppermost: because we have sinned against the Lord our God, by not obeying his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they made a collection of money, according to every man's power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To the Lord our God belongeth justice: but to us, and to our fathers confusion of face, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they sent it to Jerusulem to Joakim the priest, the son of Helcias, the son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people, that were found with him in Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the Lord hath pronounced against us all these evils that are come upon us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At the time when he received the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which had been taken away out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda the tenth day of the month Sivan, the silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Juda had made,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And we have not entreated the face of the Lord our God, that we might return every one of us from our most wicked ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After that Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and all the powerful men, and the people of the land from Jerusalem, and brought them bound to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Lord hath watched over us for evil, and hath brought it upon us: for the Lord is just in all his works which he hath commanded us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they said: Behold we have sent you money, buy with it holocausts, and frankincense, and make meat offerings, and offerings for sin at the altar of the Lord our God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And we have not hearkened to his voice to walk in the commandments of the Lord which he hath set before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And pray ye for the life of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And now, O Lord God of Israel, who hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and with signs, and with wonders, and with thy great power, and with a mighty arm, and hast made thee a name as at this day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And that the Lord may give us strength, and enlighten our eyes, that we may live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and may serve them many days, and may find favour in their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have acted unjustly, O Lord our God, against all thy justices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And pray ye for us to the Lord our God: for we have sinned against the Lord our God, and his wrath is not turned away from us even to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let thy wrath be turned away from us: for we are left a few among the nations where thou hast scattered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And read ye this book, which we have sent to you to be read in the temple of the Lord, on feasts, and proper days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Hear, O Lord, our prayers, and our petitions, and deliver us for thy own sake: and grant that we may find favour in the sight of them that have led us away:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you shall say: To the Lord our God belongeth justice, but to us confusion of our face: as it is come to pass at this day to all Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, and that thy name is called upon Israel, and upon his posterity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>To our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Look down upon us, O Lord, from thy holy house, and incline thy ear, and hear us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We have sinned before the Lord our God, and have not believed him, nor put our trust in him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Open thy eyes, and behold: for the dead that are in hell, whose spirit is taken away from their bowels, shall not give glory and justice to the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And we were not obedient to him, and we have not harkened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his commandments, which he hath given us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the soul that is sorrowful for the greatness of evil she hath done, and goeth bowed down, and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul giveth glory and justice to thee the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>From the day that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, we were disobedient to the Lord our God: and going astray we turned away from hearing his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For it is not for the justices of our fathers that we pour out our prayers, and beg mercy in thy sight, O Lord our God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And many evils have cleaved to us, and the curses which the Lord foretold by Moses his servant: who brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But because thou hast sent out thy wrath, and thy indignation upon us, as thou hast spoken by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God according to all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thus saith the Lord: Bow down your shoulder, and your neck, and serve the king of Babylon: and you shall remain in the land which I have given to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And we have gone away every man after the inclinations of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God.  Chapter2</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to serve the king of Babylon: I will cause you to depart out of the cities of Juda, and from without Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I will take away from you the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, and all the land shall be without any footstep of inhabitants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they hearkened not to thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon: and thou hast made good thy words, which thou spokest by the hands of thy servants the prophets, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers should be removed out of their place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And behold they are cast out to the heat of the sun, and to the frost of the night: and they have died in grievous pains, by famine, and by the sword, and in banishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And thou hast made the temple, in which thy name was called upon, as it is at this day, for the iniquity of the house of Israel, and the house of Juda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And thou hast dealt with us, O Lord our God, according to all thy goodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>As thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses, in the day when thou didst command him to write thy law before the children of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Saying: If you will not hear my voice, this great multitude shall be turned into a very small number among the nations, where I will scatter them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>For I know that the people will not hear me, for they are a people of a stiff neck: but they shall turn to their heart in the land of their captivity:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they shall know that I am the Lord their God: and I will give them a heart, and they shall understand: and ears, and they shall hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and shall be mindful of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they shall turn away themselves from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, that sinned against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And I will bring them back again into the land which I promised with an oath to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be masters thereof: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And I will make with them another covenant that shall be everlasting, to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more remove my people, the children of Israel, out of the land that I have given them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
