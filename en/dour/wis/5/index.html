For as a vessel that a man uses when it is broken becometh useless, even so are their gods:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When they are placed in the house, their eyes are full of dust by the feet of them that go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as the gates are made sure on every side upon one that hath offended the king, or like a dead man carried to the grave, so do the priests secure the doors with bars and locks, lest they be stripped by thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They light candles to them, and in great number, of which they cannot see one: but they are like beams in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they say that the creeping things which are of the earth, gnaw their hearts, while they eat them and their garments, and they feel it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their faces are black with the smoke that is made in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Owls, and swallows, and other birds fly upon their bodies, and upon their heads, and cats in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whereby you may know that they are no gods. Therefore fear them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The gold also which they have, is for shew, but except a man wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were molten, did they feel it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Men buy them at a high price, whereas there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having not the use of feet they are carried upon shoulders, declaring to men how vile they are. Be they confounded also that worship them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore if they fall to the ground, they rise not up again of themselves, nor if a man set them upright, will they stand by themselves, but their gifts shall be set before them, as to the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and abuse: in like manner also their wives take part of them, but give nothing of it either to the sick, or to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The childbearing and menstruous women touch their sacrifices: knowing therefore by these things that they are not gods, fear them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For how can they be called gods? because women set offerings before the gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And priests sit in their temples, having their garments rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The priests take away their garments, and clothe their wives and their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And whether it be evil that one doth unto them, or good, they are not able to recompense it: neither can they set up a king nor put him down:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>In like manner they can neither give riches, nor requite evil. If a man make a vow to them, and perform it not, they cannot require it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They cannot deliver a man from death nor save the weak from the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They cannot restore the blind man to his sight: nor deliver a man from distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They shall not pity the widow, nor do good to the fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Their gods, of wood, and of stone, and of gold, and of silver, are like the stones that are hewn out of the mountains: and they that worship them shall be confounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>How then is it to be supposed, or to be said, that they are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Even the Chaldeans themselves dishonour them: who when they hear of one dumb that cannot speak, they present him to Bel, entreating him, that he may speak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>As though they could be sensible that have no motion themselves: and they, when they shall perceive this, will leave them: for their gods themselves have no sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The women also with cords about them, sit in the ways, burning olive stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when any one of them, drawn away by some passenger, lieth with him, she upbraideth her neighbour, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But all things that are done about them, are false: how is it then to be thought, or to be said, that they are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they are made by workmen, and by goldsmiths. They shall be nothing else but what the priests will have them to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For the artificers themselves that make them, are of no long continuance. Can those things then that are made by them be gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But they have left false things and reproach to them that come after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For when war cometh upon them, or evils, the priests consult with themselves where they may hide themselves with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>How then can they be thought to be gods, that can neither deliver themselves from war, nor save themselves from evils?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For seeing they are but of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, it shall be known hereafter that they are false things, by all nations and kings: and it shall be manifest that they are no gods, but the work of men's hands, and that there is no work of God in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Whence therefore is it known that they are not gods, but the work of men's hands, and no work of God is in them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They cannot set up a king over the land, nor give rain to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They determine no causes, nor deliver countries from oppression; because they can do nothing, and are as daws between heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>For when fire shall fall upon the house of these gods of wood, and of silver, and of gold, their priests indeed will flee away, and be saved: but they themselves shall be burnt in the midst like beams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And they cannot withstand a king and war. How then can it be supposed, or admitted that they are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Neither are these gods of wood, and of stone, and laid over with gold, and with silver, able to deliver themselves from thieves or robbers: they that are stronger than them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Shall take from them the gold, and silver, and the raiment wherewith they are clothed, and shall go their way, neither shall they help themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power: or else a profitable vessel in the house, with which the owner thereof will be well satisfied: or a door in the house, to keep things safe that are therein, than such false gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The sun, and the moon, and the stars being bright, and sent forth for profitable uses, are obedient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>In like manner the lightning, when it breaketh forth, is easy to be seen: and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the clouds when God commandeth them to go over the whole world, do that which is commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>The fire also being sent from above to consume mountains and woods, doth as it is commanded. But these neither in shew, nor in power are like to any one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Wherefore it is neither to be thought, nor to be said, that they are gods: since they are neither able to judge causes, nor to do any good to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Knowing therefore that they are not gods, fear them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>For neither can they curse kings, nor bless them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Neither do they shew signs in the heaven to the nations, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Beasts are better than they, which can fly under a covert, and help themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Therefore there is no manner of appearance that they are gods: so fear them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing, so are their gods of wood, and of silver, and laid over with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>They are no better than a white thorn in a garden, upon which every bird sitteth. In like manner also their gods of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, are like to a dead body cast forth in the dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>By the purple also and the scarlet which are motheaten upon them, you shall know that they are not gods. And they themselves at last are consumed, and shall be a reproach in the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Better therefore is the just man that hath no idols: for he shall be far from reproach.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
