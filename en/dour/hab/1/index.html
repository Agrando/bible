Lord, thou hast appointed him for judgment: and made him strong for correction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thy eyes are too pure to behold evil, and thou canst not look on iniquity. Why lookest thou upon them that do unjust things, and holdest thy peace when the wicked devoureth the man that is more just than himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea, and as the creeping things that have no ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He lifted up all them with his hook, he drew them in his drag, and gathered them into his net: for this he will be glad and rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore will he offer victims to his drag, and he will sacrifice to his net: because through them his portion is made fat, and his meat dainty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this cause therefore he spreadeth his net, and will not spare continually to slay the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
