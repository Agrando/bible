Make them, O Lord, bless thee more fully: and to offer up to thee a sacrifice of thy praise, and of their health, that all nations may know, that thou alone art God in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately Raguel commanded his servants, to fill up the pit they had made, before it was day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he spoke to his wife to make ready a feast, and prepare all kind of provisions that are necessary for such as go a journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He caused also two fat kine, and four wethers to be killed, and a banquet to be prepared for all his neighbours, and all his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Raguel adjured Tobias, to abide with him two weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And of all things which Raguel possessed, he gave one half to Tobias, and made him a writing, that the half that remained should after their decease come also to Tobias.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
