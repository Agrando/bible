And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he answered: I know it: and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who dwelleth at Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Tobias said to him: Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father. Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So going in he saluted him, and said: Joy be to thee always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Tobias said: What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the young man said to him: Be of good courage, thy cure from God is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Tobias said to him: Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus at Rages, a city of the Medes? and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the angel said to him: I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Tobias said to him: I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or what tribe art thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Raphael the angel answered: Dost thou seek the family of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great family. But I pray thee be not angry that I desired to know thy family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the angel said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Tobias answering, said: May you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
