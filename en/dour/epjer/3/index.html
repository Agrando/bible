At these words she went into an upper chamber of her house: and for three days and three nights did neither eat nor drink:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But continuing in prayer with tears besought God, that he would deliver her from this reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass on the third day, when she was making an end of her prayer, blessing the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>She said: Blessed is thy name, O God of our fathers: who when thou hast been angry, wilt shew mercy, and in the time of tribulation forgivest the sins of them that call upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>To thee, O Lord, I turn my face, to thee I direct my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I beg, O Lord, that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach, or else take me away from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou knowest, O Lord, that I never coveted a husband, and have kept my soul clean from all lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Never have I joined myself with them that play: neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But a husband I consented to take, with thy fear, not with my lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And either I was unworthy of them, or they perhaps were not worthy of me: because perhaps thou hast kept me for another man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thy counsel is not in man's power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But this every one is sure of that worshippeth thee, that his life, if it be under trial, shall be crowned: and if it be under tribulation, it shall be delivered: and if it be under correction, it shall be allowed to come to thy mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For thou art not delighted in our being lost: because after a storm thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou pourest in joyfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be thy name, O God of Israel, blessed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>At that time the prayers of them both were heard in the sight of the glory of the most high God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael was sent to heal them both, whose prayers at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
