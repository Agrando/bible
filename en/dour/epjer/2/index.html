And he forthwith leaped up from his place at the table, and left his dinner, and came fasting to the body:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And taking it up carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Remembering the word which the Lord spoke by Amos the prophet: Your festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So when the sun was down, he went and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying: Once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Tobias fearing God more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now it happened one day, that being wearied with burying, he came to his house, and cast himself down by the wall and slept,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as he was sleeping, hot dung out of a swallow's nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now this trial the Lord therefore permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of holy Job.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For whereas he had always feared God from his infancy, and kept his commandments, he repined not against God because the evil of blindness had befallen him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But continued immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For as the kings insulted over holy Job: so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest alms, and buriedst the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speak not so:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For we are the children of the saints, and look for that life which God will give to those that never change their faith from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Anna his wife went daily to weaving work, and she brought home what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whereby it came to pass, that she received a young kid, and brought it home:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when her husband heard it bleating, he said: Take heed, lest perhaps it be stolen: restore ye it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>At these words his wife being angry answered: It is evident thy hope is come to nothing, and thy alms now appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And with these, and other such like words she upbraided him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
