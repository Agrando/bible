Arise, Barac, and take hold of thy captives, O son of Abinoem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The remnants of the people are saved, the Lord hath fought among the valiant ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Out of Ephraim he destroyed them into Amalec, and after him out of Benjamin into thy people, O Amalec: Out of Machir there came down princes, and out of Zabulon they that led the army to fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The captains of Issachar were with Debbora, and followed the steps of Barac, who exposed himself to danger, as one going headlong, and into a pit. Ruben being divided against himself, there was found a strife of courageous men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Why dwellest thou between two borders, that thou mayest hear the bleatings of the flocks? Ruben being divided against himself, there was found a strife of courageous men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Galaad rested beyond the Jordan, and Dan applied himself to ships: Aser dwelt on the sea shore, and abode in the havens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Zabulon and Nephtali offered their lives to death in the region of Merome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The kings came and fought, the kings of Chanaan fought in Thanach by the waters of Mageddo, and yet they took no spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>War from heaven was made against them, the stars remaining in their order and courses fought against Sisara.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The torrent of Cison dragged their carcasses, the torrent of Cadumim, the torrent of Cisoii: tread thou, my soul, upon the strong ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The hoofs of the horses were broken whilst the stoutest of the enemies fled amain, and fell headlong down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Curse ye the land of Meroz, said the angel of the Lord: curse the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to help his most valiant men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blessed among women be Jahel the wife of Haber the Cinite, and blessed be she in her tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He asked her water and she gave him milk, and offered him butter in a dish fit for princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She put her left hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's hammer, and she struck Sisara, seeking in his head a place for the wound, and strongly piercing through his temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>At her feet he fell: he fainted, and he died: he rolled before her feet, and he lay lifeless and wretched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>His mother looked out at a window, and howled: and she spoke from the dining room: Why is his chariot so long in coming back? Why are the feet of his horses so slow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>One that was wiser than the rest of his wives, returned this answer to her mother in law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Perhaps he is now dividing the spoils, and the fairest of the women is chosen out for him: garments of divers colours are given to Sisara for his prey, and furniture of different kinds is heaped together to adorn the necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So let all thy enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love thee shine, as the sun shineth in his rising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the land rested for forty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
