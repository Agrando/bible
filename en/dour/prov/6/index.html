Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou rise out of thy sleep?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth discord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My son, beep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep thee; and when thou awakest, talk with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife, shall not be clean when he shall touch her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth to fill his hungry soul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if he be taken he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up all the substance of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach shall not be blotted out:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Nor will he yield to any man's prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
