Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for thyself, lest thou fall under reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that boasteth, and doth not fulfil his promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall break hardness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having his fill he hate thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>To trust to an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a rotten tooth, and weary foot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him water to drink:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It is better to sit m a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman, and in a common house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good tidings from a far country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain troubled with the foot, and a corrupted spring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a searcher of majesty, shall be overwhelmed by glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
