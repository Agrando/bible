And so it came to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sellum the son of Jabes began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Azarias king of Juda: and reigned one month in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Manahem the son of Gadi went up from Thersa: and he came into Samaria, and struck Sellum the son of Jabes in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the rest of the acts of Sellum, and his conspiracy, which he made, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Manahem destroyed Thapsa and all that were in it and the borders thereof from Thersa, because they would not open to him: and he slew all the women thereof that were with child, and ripped them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the nine and thirtieth year of Azarias king of Juda, reigned Manahem son of Gadi over Israel ten years in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he did that which was evil before the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin all his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Phul king of the Assyrians came into the land, and Manahem gave Phul a thousand talents of silver, to aid him and to establish him in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Manahem laid a tax upon Israel, on all that were mighty and rich, to give the king of the Assyrians, each man fifty sides of silver: so the king of the Assyrians turned back, and did not stay in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rest of the acts of Manahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Manahem slept with his fathers: and Phaceia his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the fiftieth year of Azarias king of Juda reigned Phaceia the son of Manahem over Israel in Samaria two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he did that which was evil before the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Phacee the son of Romelia, his captain conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the tower of the king's house, near Argob, and near Arie, and with him fifty men of the sons of the Galaadites, and he slew him and reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the rest of the acts of Phaceia, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the

twenty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he did that which was evil before the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the days of Phacee king of Israel came Theglathphalasar king of Assyria, and took Aion, and Abel Domum Maacha and Janoe, and Cedes, and Asor, and Galaad, and Galilee, and all the land of Nephtali: and carried them captives into Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Osee son of Ela conspired, and formed a plot against Phacee, the son of Romelia, and struck him, and slew him: and reigned in his stead in the twentieth year of Joatham the son of Ozias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the rest of the acts of Phaces, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In the second year of Phacee the son of Romelia king of Israel reigned Joatham son of Ozias king of Juda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Jerusa, the daughter of Sadoc.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he did that which was right before the Lord: according to all that his father Ozias had done, so did he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the high places he took not away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places: he built the highest gate of the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the rest of the acts of Joatham, end all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In those days the Lord began to send into Juda Basin king of Syria, and Phacee the son of Romelia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Joatham slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David his father, and Achaz his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
