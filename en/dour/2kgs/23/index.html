And the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias: and they anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Pharao Nechao bound him at Rebla, which is in the land of Emath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem: and he set a fine upon the land, of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Pharao Nechao made Eliacim the son of Josias king in the room of Josias his father: and turned his name to Joakim. And he took Joachaz away and carried him into Egypt, and he died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao, after he had taxed the land for every man, to contribute according to the commandment of Pharao: and he exacted both the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every man according to his ability: to give to Pharao Nechao.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Zebida the daughter of Phadaia of Ruma.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he did evil before the Lord according to all that his fathers had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
