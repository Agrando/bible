pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, he and all his army against Jerusalem: and they surrounded it: end raised works round about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the city was shut up and besieged till the eleventh year of king Sedecias,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The ninth day of the month: and a famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And a breach was made into the city: and all the men of war fled in the night between the two walls by the king's garden, (now the Chaldees besieged the city round about,) and Sedecias fled by the way that leadeth to the plains of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all the warriors that were with him were scattered, and left him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha, and he gave judgment upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he slew the sons of Sedecias before his face, and he put out his eyes, and bound him with chains, and brought him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In the fifth month, the seventh day of the month, that is, the nineteenth year of the king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan commander of the army, a servant of the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and the houses of Jerusalem, and every house he burnt with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the army of the Chaldees, which was with the commander of the troops, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Nabuzardan the commander of the army, carried away the rest of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the common people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But of the poor of the land he left some dressers of vines and husbandmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the pillars of brass that were in the temple of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass which was in the house of the Lord, the Chaldees broke in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They took away also the pots of brass, and the mazers, and the forks, and the cups, and the mortars, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover also the censers, and the bowls, such as were of gold in gold, and such as were of silver in silver, the general of the army took away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That is, two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made in the temple of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One pillar was eighteen cubits high, and the chapiter of brass which was upon it was three cubits high: and the network, and the pomegranates that were upon the chapiter of the pillar, were all of brass: and the second pillar had the like adorning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the general of the army took Seraias the chief priest, and Sophonias the second priest, and three doorkeepers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of the city one eunuch, who was captain over the men of war: and five men of them that had stood before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher the captain of the army who exercised the young soldiers of the people of the land: and threescore men of the common people, who were found in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These Nabuzardan the general of the army took away, and carried them to the king of Babylon to Reblatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Reblatha in the land of Emath: so Juda was carried away out of their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But over the people that remained in the land of Juda, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had left, he gave the government to Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when all the captains of the soldiers had heard this, they and the men that were with them, to wit, that the king of Babylon had made Godolias governor, they came to Godolias to Maspha, Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Johanan the son of Caree, and Saraia the son of Thanehumeth the Netophathite, and Jezonias the son of Maachathi, they and their men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying : Be not afraid to serve the Chaldees: stay in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismael the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the seed royal came, and ten men with him: and smote Godolias so that he died: and also the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him in Maspha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And all the people both little and great, and the captains of the soldiers, rising up went to Egypt, fearing the Chaldees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Joachin king of Juda, in the twelfth month the seven and twentieth day of the month: Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Joachin king of Juda out of prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he spoke kindly to him: and he set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he changed his garments which he had in prison, and he ate bread always before him, all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he appointed him a continual allowance, which was also given him by the king day by day, all the days of his life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
