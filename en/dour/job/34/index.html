When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If I have erred, teach thou me : if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I. : but if thou know any thing better, speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>My father, let Job be tried even to the end : cease not from the man of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us : and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
