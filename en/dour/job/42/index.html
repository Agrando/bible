Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear, and I will speak : I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite : My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before my, as my servant Job hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take unto you therefore seven oxen, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust : and my servant Job shall pray for you : his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you : for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house : and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of fold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he had seven sons, and three daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he called the names of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children's children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
