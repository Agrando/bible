And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now on a certain day when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou ? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to fell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
