And the army of Pharao was come out of Egypt: and the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem, hearing these tidings, departed from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Juda, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold the army of Pharao, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their own land, into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus saith the Lord: Deceive not your souls, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us: for they shall not go away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you should even beat al: the army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left of them some wounded men: they shall rise up, every man from his tent, and burn this city with Are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from Jerusalem, because of Pharao's army,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jeremias went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin: and to divide a possession there in the presence of the citizens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he was come to the gate of Benjamin, the captain of the gate, who I was there in his turn, was one named Jerias, the son of Selemias, the son of Hananias: and he took hold of Jeremias the prophet, saying: Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jeremias answered: It is not so, I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Jerias took Jeremias and brought him to the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremias, and they beat him, and cast him into the prison that was in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for he was chief over the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Jeremias went into the house of the prison, and into the dungeon: and Jeremias remained there many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Sedecias the king, sending, took him: and asked him secretly in his house, and said: Is there, thinkest thou, any word from the Lord? And Jeremias said: There is. And he said: Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jeremias said to king Sedecias: In what have I offended against thee, or thy servants, or thy people, that thou hast cast me into prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Where are your prophets that prophesied to you, and said: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, and against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore hear, I beseech thee, my lord the king: let my petition be accepted in thy sight: and send me not back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremias should be committed into the entry of the prison: and that they should give him daily a piece of bread, beside broth, till all the bread in the city were spent: and Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
