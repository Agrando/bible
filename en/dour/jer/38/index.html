And Jeremias sunk into the mire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Abdemelech the Ethiopian, an eunuch that was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon: but the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abdemelech went out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done against Jeremias the prophet, casting him into the dungeon to die there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king commanded Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying: Take from hence thirty men with thee, end draw up Jeremias the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Abdemelech taking the men with him, went into the king's house that was under the storehouse: and he took from thence old rags, and old rotten things, and he let them down by cords to Jeremias into the dungeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Abdemelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremias: Put these old rags and these rent and rotten things under thy arms, and upon the cords: and Jeremias did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they drew up Jeremias with the cords, and brought him forth out of the dungeon. And Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And king Sedecias sent, and took Jeremias the prophet to him to the third gate, that was in the house of the Lord: and the king said to Jeremias: I will ask thee a thing, hide nothing from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jeremias said to Sedecias: If I shall declare it to thee, wilt thou not put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then king Sedecias swore to Jeremias, in private, saying: As the Lord liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, nor will I deliver thee into the hands of these men that seek thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jeremias said to Sedecias: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: If thou wilt take a resolution and go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burnt with fire: and thou shalt be safe, and thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire: and thou shalt not escape out of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And king Sedecias said to Jeremias: I am afraid because of the Jews that are fled over to the Chaldeans: lest I should be delivered into their hands, and they should abuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Jeremias answered: They shall not deliver thee: hearken, I beseech thee, to the word of the Lord, which I speak to thee, and it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord hath shewn me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold all the women that are left in the house of the king of Juda, shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon: and they shall say: Thy men of peace have deceived thee, and have prevailed against thee, they have plunged thy feet in the mire, and in a slippery place, and they have departed from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all thy wives, and thy children shall be brought out to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape their hands, but thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and he shall burn this city with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Sedecias said to Jeremias: Let no man know these words, and thou shalt not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee, and shall come to thee, and say to thee: Tell us what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not kill thee: and also what the king said to thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou shalt say to them: I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not command me to be carried back into the house of Jonathan, to die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him: and he spoke to them according to all the words that the king had commanded him: and they left him: for nothing had been heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison, until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and it came to pass that Jerusalem was taken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
