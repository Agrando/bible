Thus saith the Lord: Hath Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? Why then hath Melchom inherited Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will cause the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into a heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire, and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with haircloth: mourn and go about by the hedges: for Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why gloriest thou in the valleys? thy valley hath flowed away, O delicate daughter, that hast trusted in thy treasures, and hast said: Who shall come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, from all that are round about thee: and you shall be scattered every one out of one another's sight, neither shall there be any to gather together them that flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon to return, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Against Edom.
