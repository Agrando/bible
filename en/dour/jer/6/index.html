And they said: we will not walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I appointed watchmen over you, saying: Hearken ye to the sound of the trumpet. And they said: We will not hearken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what great things I will do to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, O earth: Behold I will bring evils upon this people, the fruits of their own thoughts: because they have not heard my words, and they have cast away my law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To what purpose do you bring me frankincense from Saba, and the sweet smelling cane from a far country? your holocausts are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will bring destruction upon this people, by which fathers and sons together shall fall, neighbor and kinsman shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus saith the Lord: Behold a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall lay hold on arrow and shield: they are cruel, and will have no mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea: and they shall mount upon horses, prepared as men for war, against thee, O daughter of Sion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard the fame thereof, our hands grow feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, as a woman in labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Go not out into the fields, nor walk in the highway: for the sword of the enemy, and fear is on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Gird thee with sackcloth, O daughter of my people, and sprinkle thee with ashes: make thee mourning as for an only son, a bitter lamentation, because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have set thee for a strong trier among my people: and thou shalt know and prove their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All of these princes go out of the way, they walk deceitfully, they are brass and iron: they are all corrupted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows have failed, the lead is consumed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
