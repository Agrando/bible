what is our iniquity? and what is our sin, that we have sinned against the Lord our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thou shalt say to them: Because your fathers forsook me, saith the Lord: and went after strange gods, and served them, and adored them: and they forsook me, and kept not my law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you also have done worse than your fathers: for behold every one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil heart, so as not to hearken to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So I will cast you forth out of this land, into a land which you know not, nor you fathers: and there you shall serve strange gods day and night, which shall not give you any rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, when it shall be said no more: The Lord liveth, that brought for the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, the Lord liveth, that brought the children of Israel out of the land of the north, and out of all the lands to which I cast them out: and I will bring them again into their land, which I gave to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold I will send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them: and after this I will send them many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For my eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, and their iniquity hath not been hid from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will repay first their double iniquities, and their sins: because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their idols, and they have filled my inheritance with their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, my might, and my strength, and my refuge in the day of tribulation: to thee the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth, and shall say: Surely our fathers have possessed lies, a vanity which hath not profited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make gods unto himself, and there are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, behold I will this once cause them to know, I will shew them my hand and my power: and they shall know that my name is the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
