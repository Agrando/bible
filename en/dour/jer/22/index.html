did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and it was then well with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He judged the cause of the poor and needy for his own good: was it not therefore because he knew me, saith the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thy eyes and thy heart are set upon covetousness, and upon shedding innocent blood, and upon oppression, and running after evil works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda: They shall not mourn for him, Alas, my brother, and Alas, sister: they shall not lament for him, Alas, my Lord, or, Alas, the noble one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, rotten and cast forth without the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Libanus, and cry: and lift up thy voice in Basan, and cry to them that pass by, for all thy lovers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I spoke to thee in thy properity: and thoiu saidst: I will not hear: this hath been thy way from thy youth, because thou hast not heard my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall feed all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: and then shalt thou be confounded, and ashamed of all thy wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thou that sittest in Libanus, and makest thy nest in the cedars, how hast thou mourned when sorrows came upon thee, as the pains of a woman in labour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As I live, saith the Lord, if Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda were a ring on my right hand, I would pluck him thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, and into the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will send thee, and thy mother that bore thee, into a strange country, in which you were not born, and there you shall die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they shall not return into the land, whereunto they lift up their mind to return thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Jechonias an earthen and a broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein there is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus saith the Lord: Write this man barren, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for there shall not be a man of his seed that shall sit upon the throne of David, and have power any more in Juda.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
