The beasts and the birds are consumed: because they have said: He shall not see our last end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If thou hast wearied with running with footmen, how canst thou contend with horses? and if thou hast been secure in a land of peace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full voice: believe them not when they speak good things to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: I have given my dear soul into the land of her enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood: is hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird? Is it as a bird died throughout? come ye, assemble yourselves, all the beasts of the earth, make haste to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot: they have changed my delightful portion into a desolate wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me. With desolation is all the land made desolate; because there is none that considereth in the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness, for the sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of the land to the other end thereof: there is no peace for all flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they have received an inheritance, and it shall not profit them: you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus saith the Lord against all my wicked neighbors, that touch the inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel: Behold I will pluck them out of their land, and I will pluck the house of Juda out of the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when I shall have plucked them out, I will return, and have mercy on them: and I will bring them back, every man to his inheritance, and every man to his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall come to pass, if they will be taught, and will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name: The Lord liveth, as they have taught my people to swear by baal: that they shall be built up in the midst of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck out and destroy that nation, saith the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
