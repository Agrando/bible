The prophet also and the priest are gone into a land which they knew not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hast thou utterly cast away Juda, or hath thy soul abhorred Sion? why then hast thou struck us, so that there is no healing for us? we have looked for peace, and there is no good: and for the time of healing, and behold trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, the iniquities of our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Give us not to be a reproach, for thy name's sake, and do not disgrace in us the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the graven things of the Gentiles that can send rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou the Lord our God, whom we have looked for? for thou hast made all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
