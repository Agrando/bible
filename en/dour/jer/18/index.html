Remember that I have stood in thy sight, so speak good for them, and turn away thy indignation from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore deliver up their children to famine, and bring them into the hands of the sword: let their wives be bereaved of children and widows: and let their husbands be slain by death: let their young men be stabbed with the sword in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let a cry be heard out of their houses: for thou shalt bring the robber upon them suddenly: because they have digged a pit to take me, and have hid snares for my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But thou, O Lord, knowest all their counsel against me unto death: forgive not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from thy sight: let them be overthrown before thy eyes, in the time of thy wrath do thou destroy them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
