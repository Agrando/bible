Therefore, fear them not, for they can neither do evil nor good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is none like to thee, O Lord: thou art great and great is thy name in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who shall fear thee, O king of nations? for thine is the glory: among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They shall all proved together to be senseless and foolish: the doctrine of their vanity is wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the coppersmith: violet and purple is their clothing: all these things are the work of artificers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the Lord is the true God: he is the living God, and the everlasting king, at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not made heaven and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from among those places that are under heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth for the wind out of his treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every man is become a fool for knowledge every artist is confounded in his graven idol: for what he hath cast is false, and there is no spirit in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are vain things and a ridiculous work: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The portion of Jacob is not like these: for it is he who formed all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest in a siege.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will cast away far off the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them, so that they may be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous. But I said: Truly this is my own evil, and I will bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not sought the Lord: therefore have they not understood, and all their flock is scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out of the land of the north: to make the cities of Juda a desert, and a dwelling for dragons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I know, O Lord, that the way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk, and to direct his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgement: and not in fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name: because they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have destroyed his glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
