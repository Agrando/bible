God, and men: whose memory is in benediction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He made him like the saints in glory, and magnified him in the fear of his enemies, and with his words he made prodigies to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him commandments in the sight of his people, and shewed him his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He sanctified him in his faith, and meekness, and chose him out of all flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he heard him, and his voice, and brought him into a cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he gave him commandments before his face, and a law of life and instruction, that he might teach Jacob his covenant, and Israel his judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He exalted Aaron his brother, and like to himself of the tribe of Levi:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the nation, and made him blessed in glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he girded him about with a glorious girdle, and clothed him with a robe of glory, and crowned him with majestic attire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He put upon him a garment to the feet, and breeches, and as ephod, and he compassed him with many little bells of gold all round about,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children of his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He gave him a holy robe of gold, and blue, and purple, a woven work of a wise man, endued with judgment and truth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Of twisted scarlet the work of an artist, with precious stones cut and set in gold, and graven by the work of a lapidary for a memorial, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And a crown of gold upon his mitre wherein was engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour: a work of power, and delightful to the eyes for its beauty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Before him there were none so beautiful, even from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No stranger was ever clothed with them, but only his children alone, and his grandchildren for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His sacrifices were consumed with fire every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moses filled his hands and anointed him with holy oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This was made to him for an everlasting testament, and to his seed as the days of heaven, to execute the office of the priesthood, and to have praise, and to glorify his people in his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He chose him out of all men living, to offer sacrifice to God, incense, and a good savour, for a memorial to make reconciliation for his people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he gave him power in his commandments, in the covenants of his judgments, that he should teach Jacob his testimonies, and give light to Israel in his law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And strangers stood up against him, and through envy the men that were with Dathan and Abiron, compassed him about in the wilderness, and the congregation of Core in their wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Lord God saw and it pleased him not, and they were consumed in his wrathful indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He wrought wonders upon them, and consumed them with a flame of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he added glory to Aaron, and gave him an inheritance, and divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He prepared them bread in the first place unto fulness: for the sacrifices also of the Lord they shall eat, which he gave to him, and to his seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he shall not inherit among the people in the land, and he hath no portion among the people: for he himself is his portion and inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Phinees the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, by imitating him in the fear of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he stood up in the shameful fall of the people: in the goodness and readiness of his soul he appeased God for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore he made to him a covenant of peace, to be the prince of the sanctuary, and of his people, that the dignity of priesthood should be to him and to his seed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And a covenant to David the king, the son of Jesse of the tribe of Juda, an inheritance to him and to his seed, that he might give wisdom into our heart to judge his people in justice, that their good things might not be abolished, and he made their glory in their nation everlasting.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
