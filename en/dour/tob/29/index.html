mercy, lendeth to his neighbour: and he that is stronger in hand, keepeth the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Lend to thy neighbour in the time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Reap thy word, and deal faithfully with him: and thou shalt always find that which is necessary for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found, and have given trouble to them that helped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Till they receive, they kiss the hands of the lender, and in promises they humble their voice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when they should repay, they will ask time, and will return tedious and murmuring words, and will complain of the time:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if he be able to pay, he will stand off, he will scarce pay one half, and will count it as if he had found it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if not, he will defraud him of his money, and he shall get him for an enemy without cause:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he will pay him with reproaches and curses, and instead of honour and good turn will repay him injuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Many have refused to lend, not out of wickedness, but they were afraid to be defrauded without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But yet towards the poor be thou more hearty, and delay not to shew him mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Help the poor because of the commandment: and send him not away empty handed because of his poverty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend: and hide it not under a stone to be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Place thy treasure in the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shut up alms in the heart of the poor, and it shall obtain help for thee against all evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better than the shield of the mighty, and better than the spear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It shall fight for thee against thy enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good man is surety for his neighbour: and he that hath lost shame, will leave him to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Forget not the kindness of thy surety: for he hath given his life for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sinner and the unclean fleeth from his surety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety: and he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A man is surety for his neighbour: and when he hath lost all shame, he shall forsake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Evil suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and hath tossed them as a wave of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It hath made powerful men to go from place to place round about, and they have wandered in strange countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>A sinner that transgresseth the commandment of the Lord, shall fall into an evil suretyship: and he that undertaketh many things, shall fall into judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Recover thy neighbour according to thy power, and take heed to thyself that thou fall not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The chief thing for man's life is water and bread, and clothing, and a house to cover shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Better is the poor man's fare under a roof of boards, than sumptuous cheer abroad in another man's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Be contented with little instead of much, and thou shalt not hear the reproach of going abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It is a miserable life to go as a guest from house to house: for where a man is a stranger, he shall not deal confidently, nor open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He shall entertain and feed, and give drink to the unthankful, and moreover he shall hear bitter words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Go, stranger, and furnish the table, and give others to eat what thou hast in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Give place to the honourable presence of my friends: for I want my house, my brother being to be lodged with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These things are grievous to a man of understanding: the upbraiding of houseroom, and the reproaching of the lender.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
