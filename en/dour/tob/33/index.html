And all men are from the ground, and out of the earth, from whence Adam was created.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>With much knowledge the Lord hath divided them and diversified their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Some of them hath he blessed, and exalted: and some of them hath he sanctified, and set near himself: and some of them hath he cursed and brought low, end turned them from their station.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As the potter's clay is in his hand, to fashion and order it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All his ways are according to his ordering: so man is in the hand of him that made him, and he will render to him according to his judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Good is set against evil, and life against death: so also is the sinner against a just man. And so look upon all the works of the most High. Two and two, and one against another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I awaked last of all, and as one that gathereth after the grapegatherers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the blessing of God I also have hoped: and as one that gathereth grapes, have I filled the winepress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>See that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all that seek discipline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear me, ye great men, and all ye people, and hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Give not to son or wife, brother or friend, power over thee while thou livest; and give not thy estate to another, lest then repent, and thou entreat for the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As long as thou livest, and hast breath in thee, let no man change thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is better that thy children should ask of thee, than that thou look toward the hands of thy children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In all thy works keep the pre-eminence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no stain sully thy glory. In the time when thou shalt end the days of thy life, and in the time of thy decease, distribute thy inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Fodder, and a wand, and a burden are for an ass: bread, and correction, and work for a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He worketh under correction, and seeketh to rest: let his hands be idle, and he seeketh liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The yoke and the thong bend a stiff neck, and continual labours bow a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Torture and fetters are for a malicious slave: send him to work, that he be not idle:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For idleness hath taught much evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Set him to work: for so it is fit for him. And if he be not obedient, bring him down with fetters, but be not excessive towards any one: and do no grievous thing without judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If thou have a faithful servant, let him be to thee as thy own soul: treat him as a brother: because in the blood of thy soul thou hast gotten him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If thou hurt him unjustly, he will run away:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if he rise up and depart, thou knowest not whom to ask, and in what way to seek him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
