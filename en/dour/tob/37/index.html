Is not this a grief even to death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly's sake, and he will take up a shield against enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he hath: for he will devise to his own mind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the held labourer of every work</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business: give no heed to these in any matter of counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But be continually with a holy man, whomsoever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high piece to watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A wicked word shall change the beast: out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A skilful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be destitute of every thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Grace is not given him from the Lord: for he is deprived of all wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul: and the fruit of his understanding is commendable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that see shall praise him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The life of a man is in the number of his days: but the days of Israel are innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his name shall live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked, give it no power:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind pleaseth not every soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself upon any meat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness will turn to choler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>By surfeiting many have perished: but he that is temperate, shall prolong life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
