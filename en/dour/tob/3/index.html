the church of the just: and their generation, obedience and love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For God hath made the father honourable to the children: and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sine by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father, shall be a comfort to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be for- gotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sine shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A wise heart, and which hath under- standing, will abstain from sine, and in the works of justice shall have success.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
