her own self, and shall be honoured in God, and shall glory in the midst of her people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And shall open her mouth in the churches of the most High, and shall glorify herself in the sight of his power,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in the midst of her own people she shall be exalted, and shall be ad- mired in the holy assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise, and among the blessed she shall be blessed, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I came out of the mouth of the most High, the firstborn before all creatures:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I made that in the heavens there should rise light that never faileth, and as a cloud I covered all the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated into the bottom of the deep, and have walked in the waves of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And have stood in all the earth: and in every people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in every nation I have had the chief rule:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all the high and low: and in all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me: and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy inheritance in Israel, and take root in my elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of mg God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree on mount Sion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose plant in Jericho:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As a fair olive tree in the plains, and as a plane tree by the water in the streets, was I exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon. and aromatical balm: I yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I perfumed my dwelling as storax, and galbanum, and onyx, and aloes, and as the frankincense not cut, and my odour is as the purest balm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree, and my branches are of honour and grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant odour: and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>My memory is unto everlasting generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They that eat me, shall yet hunger: and they that drink me, shall yet thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He that hearkeneth to me, shall not be confounded: and they that work by me, shall not sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They that explain me shall have life everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>All these things are the book of life, and the covenant of the most High, and the knowledge of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices, and an inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He appointed to David his servant to raise up of him a most mighty king, and sitting on the throne of glory for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who filleth up wisdom as the Phison, and as the Tigris in the days of the new fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates, who multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Who sendeth knowledge as the light, and riseth up as Gehon in the time of the vintage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Who first hath perfect knowledge of her, and a weaker shall not search her out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For her thoughts are more vast than the sea, and her counsels more deep than the great ocean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I, like a brook out of a river of a mighty water; I, like a channel of a river. and like an aqueduct, came out of paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I said: I will water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And behold my brook became a great river, and my river came near to a sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light, and I will declare it afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth, and will behold all that sleep, and will enlighten all that hope in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and will leave it to them that seek wisdom, and will not cease to instruct their offspring even to the holy age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>See ye that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all that seek out the truth.</span>
