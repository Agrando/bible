And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God, and keep his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son, maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that hath the Son, hath life. He that hath not the Son, hath not life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things I write to you, that you may know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death: for that I say not that any man ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is seated in wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of God is come: and he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God, and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
