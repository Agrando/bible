Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel, whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I have given a place to my people Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and best made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Lord there is none like thee: and there is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
