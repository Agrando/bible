And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashing</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much se it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sides of gold of just weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending Are from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again into the sheath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Oman the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
