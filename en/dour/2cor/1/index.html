And I hope that you shall know unto the end:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is, was in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in faith you stand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
