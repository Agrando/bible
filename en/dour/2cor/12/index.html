But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For which thing thrice I besought the Lord, that it might depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee; for power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am become foolish: you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you: for I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is there that you have had less than the other churches, but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls; although loving you more, I be loved less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I desired Titus, and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? did we not in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before, and have not done penance for the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, that they have committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
