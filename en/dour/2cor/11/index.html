For I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted, and fall from the simplicity that is in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom we have not preached; or if you receive another Spirit, whom you have not received; or another gospel which you have not received; you might well bear with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For although I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but in all things we have been made manifest to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself, that you might be exalted? Because I preached unto you the gospel of God freely?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia; and in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you, and so I will keep myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off the occasion from them that desire occasion, that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder: for Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, (let no man think me to be foolish, otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a little.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That which I speak, I speak not according to God, but as it were in foolishness, in this matter of glorying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For you gladly suffer the foolish; whereas yourselves are wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man strike you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They are Hebrews: so am I. They are Israelites: so am I. They are the seed of Abraham: so am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise): I am more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes, save one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from false brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides those things which are without: my daily instance, the solicitude for all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and so escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
