And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf; that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Christ died for all; that they also who live, may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh; but now we know him so no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away, behold all things are made new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ; and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins; and he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us. For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us, that we might be made the justice of God in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
