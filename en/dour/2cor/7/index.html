We have injured no man, we have corrupted no man, we have overreached no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before, that you are in our hearts, to die together, and to live together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Great is my confidence for you, great is my glorying for you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For also when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we suffered all tribulation; combats without, fears within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation, wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent; and if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful; but because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you; yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge: in all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that I did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it; but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation, we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his bowels are more abundantly towards you; remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you have received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
