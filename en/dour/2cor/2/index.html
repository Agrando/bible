For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
