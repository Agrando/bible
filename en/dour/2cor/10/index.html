If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ's, let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ's, so are we also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles, when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we dare not match, or compare ourselves with some, that commend themselves; but we measure ourselves by ourselves, and compare ourselves with ourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Not glorying beyond measure in other men's labours; but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, unto those places that are beyond you, to preach the gospel, not to glory in another man's rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he, whom God commendeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
