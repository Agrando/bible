And when he was come to it, he found nothing but leaves. For it was not the time for figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And answering he said to it: May no man hereafter eat fruit of thee any more for ever. And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came to Jerusalem. And when he was entered into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the chairs of them that sold doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he suffered not that any man should carry a vessel through the temple;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written, My house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Which when the chief priests and the scribes had heard, they sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because the whole multitude was in admiration at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when evening was come, he went forth out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter remembering, said to him: Rabbi, behold the fig tree, which thou didst curse, is withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answering, saith to them: Have the faith of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Amen I say to you, that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and be cast into the sea, and shall not stagger in his heart, but believe, that whatsoever he saith shall be done; it shall be done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I say unto you, all things, whatsoever you ask when ye pray, believe that you shall receive; and they shall come unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when you shall stand to pray, forgive, if you have aught against any man; that your Father also, who is in heaven, may forgive you your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if you will not forgive, neither will your Father that is in heaven, forgive you your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they come again to Jerusalem. And when he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they say to him: By what authority dost thou these things? and who hath given thee this authority that thou shouldst do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answering, said to them: I will also ask you one word, and answer you me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they thought with themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If we say, From men, we fear the people. For all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they answering, say to Jesus: We know not. And Jesus answering, saith to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
