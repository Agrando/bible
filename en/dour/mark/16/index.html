For it was very great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they going out, fled from the sepulchre. For a trembling and fear had seized them: and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they hearing that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
