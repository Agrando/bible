And they murmured against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, to day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But they laid hands on him, and held him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>An one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and they laid hold on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they brought Jesus to the high priest; and all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And their witness did not agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him: Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking on him she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>But he began to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
