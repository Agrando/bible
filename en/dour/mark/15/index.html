But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused him in many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But they again cried out: Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Save thyself, coming down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
