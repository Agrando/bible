And many other such like things you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
