But they held their peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to Simon he gave the name Peter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananean:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his mother and his bretheren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
