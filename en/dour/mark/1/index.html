And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
