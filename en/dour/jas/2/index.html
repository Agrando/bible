Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
