For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one's self unspotted from this world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
