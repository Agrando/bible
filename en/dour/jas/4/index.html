Are they not hence, from your concupiscences, which war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You covet, and have not: you kill, and envy, and can not obtain. You contend and war, and you have not, because you ask not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask, and receive not; because you ask amiss: that you may consume it on your concupiscences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world, becometh an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be subject therefore to God, but resist the devil, and he will fly from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners: and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be humbled in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law, and judgeth the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one lawgiver, and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that say: To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year, and will traffic, and make our gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while, and afterwards shall vanish away. For that you should say: If the Lord will, and if we shall live, we will do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you rejoice in your arrogancies. All such rejoicing is wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To him therefore who knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
