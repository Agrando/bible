You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold the hire of the labourers, who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned and put to death the Just One, and he resisted you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth: patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be you therefore also patient, and strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take, my brethren, for an example of suffering evil, of labour and patience, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is merciful and compassionate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be, yea, yea: no, no: that you fall not under judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any of you sad? Let him pray. Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man: and the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth, and it rained not for three years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he prayed again: and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My brethren, if any of you err from the truth, and one convert him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way, shall save his soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
