If we deny him, he will also deny us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he can not deny himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words, for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who have erred from the truth, saying, that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild towards all men, apt to teach, patient,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
