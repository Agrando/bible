Be sober.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whom do thou also avoid, for he hath greatly withstood our words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever.
