He to whom any thing is owing from his friend or neighbour or brother, cannot demand it again, because it is the year of remission of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Of the foreigner or stranger thou mayst exact it: of thy countryman and neighbour thou shalt not have power to demand it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there shall be no poor nor beggar among you: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in the land which he will give thee in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep all things that he hath ordained, and which I command thee this day, he will bless thee, as he hath promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou shalt lend to many nations, and thou shalt borrow of no man. Thou shalt have dominion over very many nations, and no one shall have dominion over thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If one of thy brethren that dwelleth within the gates of thy city in the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, come to poverty: thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor close thy hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But shalt open it to the poor man, thou shalt lend him, that which thou perceivest he hath need of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Beware lest perhaps a wicked thought steal in upon thee, and thou say in thy heart: The seventh year of remission draweth nigh; and thou turn away thy eyes from thy poor brother, denying to lend him that which he asketh: lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and it become a sin unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But thou shalt give to him: neither shalt thou do any thing craftily in relieving his necessities: that the Lord thy God may bless thee at all times, and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There will not be wanting poor in the land of thy habitation: therefore I command thee to open thy hand to thy needy and poor brother, that liveth in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When thy brother a Hebrew man, or Hebrew woman is sold to thee, and hath served thee six years, in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when thou sendest him out free, thou shalt not let him go away empty:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But shalt give him for his way out of thy flocks, and out of thy barnfloor, and thy winepress, wherewith the Lord thy God shall bless thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Remember that thou also wast a bondservant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God made thee free, and therefore I now command thee this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he say: I will not depart: because he loveth thee, and thy house, and findeth that he is well with thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shalt take an awl, and bore through his ear in the door of thy house, and he shall serve thee for ever: thou shalt do in like manner to thy womanservant also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them tree: because he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a hireling: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works that thou dost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Of the firstlings, that come of thy herds and thy sheep, thou shalt sanctify to the Lord thy God whatsoever is of the male sex.
