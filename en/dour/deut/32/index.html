Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember the days of old, think upon every generation: ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: thy elders and they will tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the Most High divided the nations: when he separated the sons of Adam, he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the Lord's portion is his people: Jacob the lot of his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness: he led him about, and taught him: and he kept him as the apple of his eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them, he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Lord alone was his leader: and there was no strange god with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He set him upon high land: that he might eat the fruits of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the hardest stone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan: and goats with the marrow of wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the grape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The beloved grew fat, and kicked: he grew fat, and thick and gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They sacrificed to devils and not to God: to gods whom they knew not: that were newly come up, whom their fathers worshipped not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou hast forsaken the God that beget thee, and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath: because his own sons and daughters provoked him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be: for it is a perverse generation, and unfaithful children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have provoked me with that which was no god, and have angered me with their vanities: and I will provoke them with that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest hell: and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the foundations of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite: I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with the man in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I said: Where are they? I will make the memory of them to cease from among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it: lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say: Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O that they would be wise and would understand, and would provide for their last end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand? Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For our God is not as their gods: our enemies themselves are judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which is incurable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my treasures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants : he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they trusted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink offerings: let them arise and help you, and protect you in your distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say: I live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment: I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the bare head of the enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them : Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day: which you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfil all that is written in this law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho: and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Her, and was gathered to his people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin: and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
