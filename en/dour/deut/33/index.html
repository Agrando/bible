Who shall suck as milk the abundance of the sea, and the hidden treasures of the sands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to Gad he said: Blessed be Gad in his breadth: he hath rested as a lion, and hath seized upon the arm and the top of the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he saw his pre-eminence, that in his portion the teacher was laid up: who was with the princes of the people, and did the justices of the Lord, and his judgment with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To Dan also he said: Dan is a young lion, he shall flow plentifully from Basan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And to Nephtali he said: Nephtali shall enjoy abundance, and shall be full of the blessings of the Lord: he shall possess the sea and the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>To Aser also he said: Let Aser be blessed with children, let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>His shoe shall be iron and brass.
