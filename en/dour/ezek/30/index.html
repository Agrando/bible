the Lord came to me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Son of man prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Howl ye, Woe, woe to the day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the day is near, yea the day of the Lord is near: a cloudy day, it shall be the time of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sword shall come upon Egypt: and there shall be dread in Ethiopia, when the wounded shall fall in Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be taken away, and the foundations thereof shall be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the rest of the crowd, and Chub, and the children of the land of the covenant, shall fall with them by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus saith the Lord God: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her empire shall be brought down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord the God of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall be desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and the cities thereof shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they shall know that I am the Lord: when I shall have set a fire in Egypt, and all the helpers thereof shall be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In that day shall messengers go forth from my face in ships to destroy the confidence of Ethiopia, and there shall be dread among them in the day of Egypt: because it shall certainly come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus saith the Lord God : I will make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He and his people with him, the strongest of nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords upon Egypt: and shall fill the land with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the channels of the rivers dry, and will deliver the land into the hand of the wicked: and will lay waste the land and all that is therein by the hands of strangers, I the Lord have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus saith the Lord God: I will also destroy the idols, and I will make an end of the idols of Memphis: and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will cause a terror in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will destroy the land of Phatures, and will make a fire in Taphnis, and will execute judgments in Alexandria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will pour out my indignation upon Pelusium the strength of Egypt, and will cut off the multitude of Alexandria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will make a fire in Egypt: Pelusium shall be in pain like a woman in labour, and Alexandria shall be laid waste, and in Memphis there shall be daily distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The young men of Heliopolis, and of Bubastus shall fall by the sword, and they themselves shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in Taphnis the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the sceptres of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall be led into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharao king of Egypt: and behold it is not bound up, to be healed, to be tied up with clothes, and swathed with linen, that it might recover strength, and hold the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against Pharao king of Egypt, and I will break into pieces his strong arm, which is already broken: and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand: and I will break the arms of Pharao, and they shall groan bitterly being slain before his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharao shall fall: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have given my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall have stretched it forth upon the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and will scatter them through the countries, and they shall know that I am the Lord.</span>
