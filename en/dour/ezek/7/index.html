For the vision which regardeth all the multitude thereof, shall not go back: neither shall man be strengthened in the iniquity of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blow the trumpet, let all be made ready, yet there is none to go to the battle: for my wrath shall be upon all the people thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword without: and the pestilence, and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword: and they that are in the city, shall be devoured by the pestilence, and the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And such of them as shall flee shall escape: and they shall be in the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them trembling, every one for his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All hands shall be made feeble, and all knees shall run with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall gird themselves with haircloth, and fear shall cover them, and shame shall be upon every face, and baldness upon all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Their silver shall be cast forth, and their gold shall become a dunghill. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord. They shall not satisfy their soul, and their bellies shall not be filled: because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they have turned the ornament of their jewels into pride, and have made of it the images of their abominations, and idols: therefore I have made it an uncleanness to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it into the hands of strangers for spoil, and to the wicked of the earth for a prey, and they shall defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall violate my secret place: and robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make a shutting up: for the land is full of the judgment of blood, and the city is full of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will bring the worse of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: and I will make the pride of the mighty to cease, and they shall possess their sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When distress cometh upon them, they will seek for peace and there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Trouble shall come upon trouble, and rumour upon rumour, and they shall seek a vision of the prophet, and the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with sorrow, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and will judge them according to their judgments: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
