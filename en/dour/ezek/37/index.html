And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel : they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thou son of man, take thee a stick: and write upon it: Of Juda, and of the children of Israel his associates: and take another stick and write upon it: For Joseph the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, and of his associates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And join them one to the other into one stick, and they shall become one in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that are associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Juda, and will make them one stick: and they shall be one in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sticks whereon thou hast written, shall be in thy hand, before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from the midst of the nations whither they are gone: and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their iniquities: and I will save them out of all the places in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd: they shall walk in my judgments, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children's children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will establish them, and will multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the nations shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.</span>
