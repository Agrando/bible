Seeing he hath done all these detestable things, he shall surely die, his blood shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if he beget a son, who, seeing all his father's sine, which he hath done, is afraid, and shall not do the like to them :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And hath not grieved any man, nor withholden the pledge, nor taken away with violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That hath turned away his hand from injuring the poor, hath not taken usury and increase, but hath executed my judgments, and hath walked in my commandments: this man shall not die for the iniquity of his father, but living he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As for his father, because he oppressed and offered violence to his brother, and wrought evil in the midst of his people, behold he is dead in his own iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you say: Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his father? Verily, because the son hath wrought judgment and justice, hath kept all my commandments, and done them, living, he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The soul that sinneth, the same shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done: in his justice which he hath wrought, he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if the just man turn himself away from his justice, and do iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to work, shall he live? all his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: in the prevarication, by which he hath prevaricated, and in his sin, which he hath committed, in them he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you have said: The way of the Lord is not right. Hear ye, therefore, O house of Israel: Is it my way that is not right, and are not rather your ways perverse?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For when the just turneth himself away from his justice, and committeth iniquity, he shall die therein: in the injustice that he hath wrought he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness, which he hath wrought, and doeth judgment, and justice: he shall save his soul alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his iniquities which he hath wrought, he shall surely live, and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the children of Israel say: The way of the Lord is not right. Are not my ways right, O house of Israel, and are not rather your ways perverse?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore will I judge every man according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God. Be converted, and do penance for all your iniquities: and iniquity shall not be your ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which you have transgressed, and make to yourselves a new heart, and a new spirit: and why will you die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I desire not the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God, return ye and live.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
