Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways: and why will you die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the children of thy people: The justice of the just shall not deliver him, in what day soever he shall sin: and the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him, in what day soever he shall turn from his wickedness: and the just shall not be able to live in his justice, in what day soever he shall sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, if I shall say to the just that he shall surely live, and he, trusting in his justice, commit iniquity: all his justices shall be forgotten, and in his iniquity, which he hath committed, in the same shall he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if I shall say to the wicked: Thou shalt surely die: and he do penance for his sin, and do judgment and justice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if that wicked man restore the pledge, and render what he had robbed, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no unjust thing: he shall surely live, and shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>None of his sins, which he hath committed, shall be imputed to him: he hath done judgment and justice, he shall surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of thy people have said: The way of the Lord is not equitable: whereas their own way is unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For when the just shall depart from his justice, and commit iniquities, he shall die in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness, and shall do judgments, and justice: be shall live in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you say: The way of the Lord is not right, I will judge every one of you according to his ways, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that there came to me one that was fled from Jerusalem, saying: The city is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening, before he that was fled came: and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning, and my mouth being opened, I was silent no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Son of man, they that dwell in these ruinous places in the land of Israel, speak, saying: Abraham was one, and he inherited the land, but we are many, the land is given us in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God, You that eat with the blood and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses, and that shed blood: shall you possess the land by inheritance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You stood on your swords, you have committed abominations, and every one hath defiled his neighbour's wife; and shall you possess the land by inheritance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Say thou thus to them: Thus saith the Lord God: As I live, they that dwell in the ruinous places, shall fall by the sword: and he that is in the field, shall be given to the beasts to be devoured: and they that are in holds, and caves, shall die of the pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will make the land a wilderness, and a desert, and the proud strength thereof shall fail, and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, because there is none to pass by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have made their land waste and desolate, for all their abominations which they have committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And thou son of man: the children of thy people, that talk of thee by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another each men to his neighbour, saying: Come, and let us hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they come to thee, as if a people were coming in, and my people sit before thee: and hear thy words, and do them not: for they turn them into a song of their mouth, and their heart goeth after their covetousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And thou art to them as a musical song which is sung with a sweet and agreeable voice: and they hear thy words, and do them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when that which was foretold shall come to pass, (for behold it is coming,) then shall they know that a prophet bath been among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
