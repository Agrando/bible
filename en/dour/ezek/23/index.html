Now for their names, Samaria is Oolla, and Jerusalem is Ooliba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Oolla committed fornication against me, and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians that came to her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who were clothed with blue, princes, and rulers, beautiful youths, all horsemen, mounted upon horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she committed her fornications with those chosen men, all sons of the Assyrians: and she defiled herself with the uncleanness of all them on whom she doted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moreover also she did not forsake her fornications which she had committed in Egypt: for they also lay with her in her youth, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured out their fornication upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the sons of the Assyrians, upon whose lust she doted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They discovered her disgrace, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword: and they became infamous women, and they executed judgments in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when her sister Ooliba saw this, she was mad with lust more than she: and she carried her fornication beyond the fornication of her sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Impudently prostituting herself to the children of the Assyrians, the princes, and rulers that came to her, clothed with divers colours, to the horsemen that rode upon horses, and to young men all of great beauty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I saw that she was defiled, and that they both took one way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she increased her fornications: and when she had seen men painted on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans set forth in colours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And girded with girdles about their reins, and with dyed turbans on their heads, the resemblance of all the captains, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, and of the land of the Chaldeans wherein they were born,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She doted upon them with the lust of her eyes, and she sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when the sons of Babylon were come to her to the bed of love, they defiled her with their fornications, and she was polluted by them, and her soul was glutted with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she discovered her fornications, and discovered her disgrace: and my soul was alienated from her, as my soul was alienated from her sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For she multiplied her fornications, remembering the days of her youth, in which she played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she was mad with lust after lying with them whose flesh is as the flesh of asses: and whose issue as the issue of horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth, when thy breasts were pressed in Egypt, and the papa of thy virginity broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will raise up against thee all thy lovers with whom thy soul hath been glutted: and I will gather them together against thee round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, the nobles, and the kings, and princes, all the sons of the Assyrians, beautiful young men, all the captains, and rulers, the princes of princes, and the renowned horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall come upon thee well appointed with chariot and wheel, a multitude of people: they shall be armed against thee on every side with breastplate, and buckler, and helmet: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee by their judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will set my jealousy against thee, which they shall execute upon thee with fury: they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears: and what remains shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons, and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall strip thee of thy garments, and take away the instruments of thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will put an end to thy wickedness in thee, and thy fornication brought out of the land of Egypt: neither shalt thou lift up thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hands of them whom thou hatest, into their hands with whom thy soul hath been glutted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and they shall take away all thy labours, and shall let thee go naked, and full of disgrace, and the disgrace of thy fornication shall be discovered, thy wickedness, and thy fornications.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They have done these things to thee, because thou hast played the harlot with the nations among which thou wast defiled with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister, and I will give her cup into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus saith the Lord God: Thou shalt drink thy sister's cup, deep, and wide: thou shalt be had in derision and scorn, which containeth very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness, and sorrow: with the cup of grief, and sadness, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And thou shalt drink it, and shalt drink it up even to the dregs, and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof, thou shalt rend thy breasts: because I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast forgotten me, and hast cast me off behind thy back, bear thou also thy wickedness, and thy fornications.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Lord spoke to me, saying: Son of man, dost thou judge Oolla, and Ooliba, and dost thou declare to them their wicked deeds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Because they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and they have committed fornication with their idols: moreover also their children, whom they bore to me, they have offered to them to be devoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Yea, and they have done this to me. They polluted my sanctuary on the same day, and profaned my sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, and went into my sanctuary the same day to profane it: they did these things even in the midst of my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They sent for men coming from afar, to whom they had sent a messenger: and behold they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, and didst paint thy eyes, and wast adorned with women's ornaments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thou sattest on a very fine bed, and a table was decked before thee: whereupon thou didst set my incense, and my ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing: and to some that were brought of the multitude of men, and that came from the desert, they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries: Now will this woman still continue in her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they went in to her, as to a harlot: so went they in unto Oolla, and Ooliba, wicked women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They therefore are k just men: these shall judge them as adulteresses are judged, and as shedders of blood are judged: because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For thus saith the Lord God: Bring a multitude upon them, and deliver them over to tumult and rapine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And lee the people stone them with stones, and let them be stabbed with their swords: they shall kill their sons and daughters, and their houses they shall burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And I will take away wickedness out of the land: and all women shall learn, not to do according to the wickedness of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they shall render your wickedness upon you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
