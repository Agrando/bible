The children of Israel did according to all things that the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a men, who could not make the phase on that day, coming to Moses and Aaron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Said to them: We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man. Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the Lord among the children of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses answered them: Stay that I may consult the Lord what he will ordain concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say to the children of Israel: The man that shall be unclean by occasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a journey afar off in your nation, let him make the phase to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, a nor break a bone thereof, they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and did not make the phase, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season: he shall bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you, shall make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and justifications thereof.

All the days that the cloud abode over the tabernacle, they remained in the same place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if it was so that it continued over it a long time, the children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord, and marched not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle. At the commandment of the Lord they pitched their tents, and at his commandment they took them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and immediately at break of day left the tabernacle, they marched forward: and if it departed after a day and a night, they took down their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a longer time, the children of Israel remained in the same place, and marched not: but immediately as soon as it departed, they removed the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents, and by his word they marched: and kept the watches of the Lord according to his commandment by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
