And when you shall come to the mountains,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>View the land, of what sort it is: and the people that are the inhabitants thereof, whether they be strong or weak: few in number or many:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The land itself, whether it be good or bad: what manner of cities, walled or without walls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The ground, fat or barren, woody or without trees. Be of good courage, and bring us of the fruits of the land. Now it was the time when the first ripe grapes are fit to be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they were gone up, they viewed the land from the desert of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they went up at the south side, and came to Hebron, where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac. For Hebron was built seven years before Tanis the city of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And going forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes, they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes, which two men carried upon a lever. They took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Which was called Nehelescol, that is to say, the torrent of the cluster of grapes, because from thence the children of Israel had carried a cluster of grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days, having gone round all the country,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of the children of Israel to the desert of Pharan, which is in Cades. And speaking to them and to all the multitude, they shewed them the fruits of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they related and said: We came into the land to which thou sentest us, which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as may be known by these fruits:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But it hath very strong inhabitants, and the cities are great and walled.
