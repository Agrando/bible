For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom shall be taken awry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the rhinoceros. They shall devour the nations that are his enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none shall dare to rouse. He that blesseth thee, shall also himself be blessed: he that curseth thee shall be reckoned accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapped his hands together and said: I called thee to curse my enemies, and thou on the contrary hast blessed them three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Return to thy place. I had determined indeed greatly to honour thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Balaam made answer to Balac: Did I not say to thy messengers, whom thou sentest to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to utter any thing of my own head either good or evil: but whatsoever the Lord shall say, that I will speak?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore taking up his parable, again he said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped up, hath said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Almighty, who falling hath his eyes opened:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near. A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from Israel: and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the children of Seth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he shall possess Idumea: the inheritance of Seir shall come to their enemies, but Israel shall do manfully</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Out of Jacob shall he come that shall rule, and shall destroy the remains of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he saw Amalec, he took up his parable, and said: Amalec the beginning of nations, whose latter ends shall be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He saw also the Cinite: and took up his parable, and said: Thy habitation in- deed is strong: but though thou build thy nest in a rock,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou be chosen of the stock of Cin, how long shalt thou be able to continue? For Assur shall take thee captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And taking up his parable, again he said: Alas, who shall live when God shall do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They shall come in galleys from Italy, they shall overcome the Assyrians, and shall waste the Hebrews, and at the last they themselves also shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Balaam rose, and returned to his place: Balac also returned the way that he came.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
