among whom you shine as lights in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christ's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier, but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with honour such as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
