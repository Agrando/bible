So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me, to live is Christ; and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if to live in the flesh, that is to me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me, and now have heard of me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
