Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was returning, sitting in this chariot, and reading Isaias the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth hinder me from being baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
