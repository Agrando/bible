This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him going into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount that is called Olivet, which is nigh Jerusalem, within a sabbath day's journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days Peter rising up in the midst of the brethren, said: (now the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men, brethren, the scripture must needs be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the leader of them that apprehended Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of iniquity, and being hanged, burst asunder in the midst: and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so that the same field was called in their tongue, Haceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let their habitation become desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein. And his bishopric let another take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wherefore of these men who have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein he was taken up from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas hath by transgression fallen, that he might go to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they gave them lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
