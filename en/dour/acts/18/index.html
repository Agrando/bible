But he himself entering into the synagogue, disputed with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they desired him, that he would tarry a longer time, he consented not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But taking his leave, and saying: I will return to you again, God willing, he departed from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And going down to Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, and saluted the church, and so came down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, confirming all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a certain Jew, named Apollo, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, one mighty in the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, spoke, and taught diligently the things that are of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This man therefore began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Whom when Priscilla and Aquila had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of the Lord more diligently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whereas he was desirous to go to Achaia, the brethren exhorting, wrote to the disciples to receive him. Who, when he was come, helped them much who had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For with much vigour he convinced the Jews openly, shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus is the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
