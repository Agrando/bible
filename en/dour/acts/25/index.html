To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For if I have injured them, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man may deliver me to them: I appeal to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou appealed to Caesar? To Caesar shalt thou go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea to salute Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as they tarried there many days, Festus told the king of Paul, saying: A certain man was left prisoner by Felix.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests, and the ancients of the Jews, came unto me, desiring condemnation against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To whom I answered: It is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any man, before that he who is accused have his accusers present, and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the things laid to his charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When therefore they were come hither, without any delay, on the day following, sitting in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of things which I thought ill of:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of one Jesus deceased, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question, asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Paul appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I might send him to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the man, myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp, and had entered into the hall of audience, with the tribunes, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment, Paul was brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus saith: King Agrippa, and all ye men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews dealt with me at Jerusalem, requesting and crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. For which cause I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that examination being made, I may have what to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the things laid to his charge.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
