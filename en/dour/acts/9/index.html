And he: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he trembling and astonished, said: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the city, and there it shall be told thee what thou must do. Now the men who went in company with him, stood amazed, hearing indeed a voice, but seeing no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. But they leading him by the hands, brought him to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he was there three days, without sight, and he did neither eat nor drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision: Ananias. And he said: Behold I am here, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the street that is called Stait, and seek in the house of Judas, one named Saul of Tarsus. For behold he prayeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>(And he saw a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hands upon him, that he might receive his sight.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that invoke thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord said to him: Go thy way; for this man is to me a vessel of election, to carry my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house. And laying his hands upon him, he said: Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus hath sent me, he that appeared to thee in the way as thou camest; that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and rising up, he was baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had taken meat, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples that were at Damascus, for some days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all that heard him, were astonished, and said: Is not this he who persecuted in Jerusalem those that called upon this name: and came hither for that intent, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul increased much more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, affirming that this is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when many days were passed, the Jews consulted together to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But their laying in wait was made known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night, that they might kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the disciples taking him in the night, conveyed him away by the wall, letting him down in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he was come into Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the disciples; and they all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and told them how he had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken to him; and how in Damascus he had dealt confidently in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was with them coming in and going out in Jerusalem, and dealing confidently in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He spoke also to the Gentiles, and disputed with the Greeks; but they sought to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Which when the brethren had known, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the church had peace throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria; and was edified, walking in the fear of the Lord, and was filled with the consolation of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass that Peter, as he passed through, visiting all, came to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed for eight years, who was ill of the palsy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said to him: Eneas, the Lord Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And immediately he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron, saw him: who were converted to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And in Joppe there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass in those days that she was sick, and died. Whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppe, the disciples hearing that Peter was there, sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not be slack to come unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Peter rising up, went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood about him weeping, and shewing him the coats and garments which Dorcas made them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they all being put forth, Peter kneeling down prayed, and turning to the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and seeing Peter, she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And giving her his hand, he lifted her up. And when he had called the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it was made known throughout all Joppe; and many believed in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppe, with one Simon a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
