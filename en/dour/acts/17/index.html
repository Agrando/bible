Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And many indeed of them believed, and of honourable women that were Gentiles, and of men not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them that served God, and in the marketplace, every day with them that were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him; and some said: What is it, that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were there, employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For passing by, and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the unknown God. What therefore you worship, without knowing it, that I preach to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God, who made the world, and all things therein; he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neither is he served with men's hands, as though he needed any thing; seeing it is he who giveth to all life, and breath, and all things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times, and the limits of their habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That they should seek God, if happily they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in him we live, and move, and are; as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men, that all should every where do penance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed; giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked, but others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul went out from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But certain men adhering to him, did believe; among whom was also Dionysius, the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
