Then Paul stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions that are among the Jews: Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the fathers, do I stand subject to judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to come. For which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why should it be thought a thing incredible, that God should raise the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I indeed did formerly think, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Which also I did at Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority of the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I brought the sentence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whereupon when I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them that were in company with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord answered: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But rise up, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister, and a witness of those things which thou hast seen, and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Delivering thee from the people, and from the nations, unto which now I send thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But to them first that are at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that they should do penance, and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this cause the Jews, when I was in the temple, having apprehended me, went about to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the prophets, and Moses did say should come to pass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light to the people, and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As he spoke these things, and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Paul said: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and soberness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Agrippa said to Paul: In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul said: I would to God, that both in a little and in much, not only thou, but also all that hear me, this day, should become such as I also am, except these bands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
