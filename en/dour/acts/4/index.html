For there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they were illiterate and ignorant men, they wondered; and they knew them that they had been with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seeing the man also who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they commanded them to go aside out of the council; and they conferred among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Saying: What shall we do to these men? for indeed a known miracle hath been done by them, to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: it is manifest, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But that it may be no farther spread among the people, let us threaten them that they speak no more in this name to any man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And calling them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answering, said to them: If it be just in the sight of God, to hear you rather than God, judge ye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they threatening, sent them away, not finding how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified what had been done, in that which had come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man was above forty years old, in whom that miraculous cure had been wrought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being let go, they came to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and ancients had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who having heard it, with one accord lifted up their voice to God, and said: Lord, thou art he that didst make heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who, by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, hast said: Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people meditate vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes assembled together against the Lord and his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For of a truth there assembled together in this city against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>To do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants, that with all confidence they may speak thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By stretching forth thy hand to cures, and signs, and wonders to be done by the name of thy holy Son Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place was moved wherein they were assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul: neither did any one say that aught of the things which he possessed, was his own; but all things were common unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power did the apostles give testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord; and great grace was in them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For neither was there any one needy among them. For as many as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the price of the things they sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And laid it down before the feet of the apostles. And distribution was made to every one, according as he had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joseph, who, by the apostles, was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, by interpretation, The son of consolation,) a Levite, a Cyprian born,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Having land, sold it, and brought the price, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
