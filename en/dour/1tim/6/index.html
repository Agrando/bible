These things teach and exhort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to that doctrine which is according to godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words; from which arise envies, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Conflicts of men corrupted in mind, and who are destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we can carry nothing out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But having food, and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they that will become rich, fall into temptation, and into the snare of the devil, and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men into destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the desire of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting have erred from the faith, and have entangled themselves in many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But thou, O man of God, fly these things: and pursue justice, godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of faith: lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art called, and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate, a good confession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Which in his times he shall shew who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who only hath immortality, and inhabiteth light inaccessible, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and empire everlasting.
