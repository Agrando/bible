For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will marry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will therefore that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For some are already turned aside after Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests that rule well, be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Them that sin reprove before all: that the rest also may have fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I charge thee before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of other men's sins. Keep thyself chaste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thy frequent infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some men's sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some men they follow after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are otherwise, cannot be hid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
