Moreover Helcias, and Zacharias, and Jahiel rulers of the house of the Lord, gave to the priests to keep the phase two thousand six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Chonenias, and Semeias and Nathanael, his brethren, and Hasabias, and Jehiel, and Jozabad princes of the Levites, gave to the rest of the Levites to celebrate the phase five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the ministry was prepared, and the priests stood in their office: the Levites also in their companies, according to the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the phase was immolated: and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hand, and the Levites flayed the holocausts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they separated them to give them by the houses and families of every one, and to be offered to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses, and with the oxen they did in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they roasted the phase with fire, according to that which is written in the law: but the victims of peace offerings they boiled in caldrons, and kettles, and pots, and they distributed them speedily among all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: for the priests were busied in offering of holocausts and the fat until night: wherefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the singers the sons of Asaph stood in their order, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Idithun the prophets of the king: and the porters kept guard at every gate, so as not to depart one moment from their service: and therefore their brethren the Levites prepared meats for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So all the service of the Lord was duly accomplished that day, both in keeping the phase, and offering holocausts upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel that were found there, kept the phase at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There was no phase like to this in Israel, from the days of Samuel the prophet: neither did any of all the kings of Israel keep such a phase as Josias kept, with the priests, and the Levites, and all Juda, and Israel that were found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this phase celebrated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After that Josias had repaired the temple, Nechao king of Egypt came up to fight in Charcamis by the Euphrates: and Josias went out to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he sent messengers to him, saying: What have I to do with thee, O king of Juda?
