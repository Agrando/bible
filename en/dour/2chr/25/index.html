And the prophet departing, said: I know that God is minded to kill thee, because thou hast done this evil, and moreover hast not hearkened to my counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Amasias king of Juda taking very bad counsel, sent to Joas the son of Joachaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: Come, let us see one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he sent back the messengers, saying: The thistle that is in Libanus, sent to the cedar in Libanus, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and behold the beasts that were in the wood of Libanus passed by, and trod down the thistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou hast said: I have overthrown Edom, and therefore thy heart is lifted up with pride : stay at home, why dost thou provoke evil against thee, that both thou shouldst fall and Juda with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Amasias would not hearken to him, because it was the Lord's will that he should be delivered into the hands of enemies, because of the gods of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Joas king of Israel went up, and they presented themselves to be seen by one another: and Amasias king of Juda was in Bethsames of Juda:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Juda fell before Israel and they fled to their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joas king of Israel took Amasias king of Juda, the son of Joas, the son Joachaz, in Bethsames, and brought him to Jerusalem: and broke down the walls thereof from the gate of Ephraim, to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he took all the gold, and silver, and all the vessels, that he found in the house of God, and with Obededom, and in the treasures of the king's house, moreover also the sons of the hostages, he brought back to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Amasias the son of Joas king of Juda lived, after the death of Joas the son of Joachaz king of Israel, fifteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and last, are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after he revolted from the Lord, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled into Lachis, and they sent, and killed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they brought him back upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
