And when the people were gone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He took counsel with the ancients, who had stood before his father Solomon, while he yet lived, saying: What counsel give you to me, that I may answer the people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said to him: If thou please this people, and soothe them with kind words, they will be thy servants for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he forsook the counsel of the ancients, end began to treat with the young men, that had been brought up with him, and were in his train.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them: What seemeth good to you? or what shall I answer this people, who have said to me: Ease the yoke which thy father laid upon us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But they answered as young men, and brought up with him in pleasures, and said: Thus shalt thou speak to the people, that said to thee: Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease it: thus shalt thou answer them: My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add more weight to it: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jeroboam, and all the people came to Roboam the third day, as he commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king answered roughly, leaving the counsel of the ancients.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he spoke according to the advice of the young men : My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, which I will make heavier: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he condescended not to the people's requests: for it was the will of God, that his word might be fulfilled which he had spoken by the hand of Ahias the Silonite to Jeroboam the son of Nabat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And all the people upon the king's speaking roughly, said thus unto him: We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Isai.
