And the priests with the Levites carried the vessels of the sanctuary, which were in the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And king Solomon and all the assembly of Israel, and all that were gathered together before the ark, sacrificed rams, and oxen without number: so great was the multitude of the victims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies under the wings of the cherubims:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So that the cherubims spread their wings over the place, in which the ark was set, and covered the ark itself and its staves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the ends of the staves wherewith the ark was carried, because they were some thing longer, were seen before the oracle: but if a man were a little outward, he could not see them.
