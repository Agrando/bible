Why will you add to our sins, and heap up upon our former offences? for the sin is great, and the fierce anger of the Lord hangeth over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the soldiers left the spoils, and all that they had taken, before the princes and all the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men, whom we mentioned above, rose up and took the captives, and with the spoils clothed all them that were naked: and when they had clothed and shed them, and refreshed them with meat and drink, and anointed them because of their labour, and had taken care of them, they set such of them as could not walk, and were feeble, upon beasts, and brought them to Jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren, and they returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time king Achaz sent to the king of the Assyrians asking help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Edomites came and slew many of Juda, and took a great booty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also spread themselves among the cities of the plains, and to the south of Juda: and they took Bethsames, and Aialon, and Gaderoth, and Socho, and Thamnan, and Gamzo, with their villages, and they dwelt in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Lord had humbled Juda because of Achaz the king of Juda, for he had stripped it of help, and had contemned the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he brought, against him Thelgathphalnasar king of the Assyrians, who also afflicted him, and plundered him without any resistance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Achaz stripped the house of the Lord, and the house of the kings, and of the princes, and gave gifts to the king of the Assyrians, and yet it availed him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover also in the time of his distress he increased contempt against the Lord: king Achaz himself by himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sacrificed victims to the gods of Damascus that struck him, and he said: The gods of the kings of Syria help them, and I will appease them with victims, and they will help me; whereas on the contrary they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Achaz having taken away all the vessels of the house of God, and broken them, shut up the doors of the temple of God, and made himself altars in all the corners of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in all the cities of Juda he built altars to burn frankincense, and he provoked the Lord the God of his fathers to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the rest of his acts, and all his works first and last are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Achaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of Jerusalem: for they received him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel. And Ezechias his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
