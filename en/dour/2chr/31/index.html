And when they had done so,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They brought in faithfully both the firstfruits, and the tithes, and all they had vowed. And the overseer of them was Chonenias the Levite, and Semei his brother was the second,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after him Jehiel, and Azarias, and Nahath, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jesmachias, and Mahath, and Banaias, overseers under the hand of Chonenias, and Semei his brother, by the commandment of Ezechias the king, and Azarias the high priest of the house of God, to whom all things appertained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Core the son of Jemna the Levite, the porter of the east gate, was overseer of the things which were freely offered to the Lord, and of the firstfruits and the things dedicated for the holy of holies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And under his charge were Eden, and Benjamin, Jesue, and Semeias, and Amarias, and Sechenias, in the cities of the priests, to distribute faithfully portions to their brethren, both little and great:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Besides the males from three years old and upward, to all that went into the temple of the Lord, and whatsoever there was need of in the ministry, and their offices according to their courses, day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To the priests by their families, and to the Levites from the twentieth year and upward, by their classes and companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to all the multitude, both to their wives, and to their children of both sexes, victuals were given faithfully out of the things that had been sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also of the sons of Aaron who were in the fields and in the suburbs of each city, there were men appointed, to distribute portions to all the males, among the priests and the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Ezechias did all things, which we have said in all Juda, and wrought that which was good; and right, and truth, before the Lord his God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In all the service of the ministry of the house of the Lord according to the law and the ceremonies, desiring to seek his God with all his heart, and he did it and prospered,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
