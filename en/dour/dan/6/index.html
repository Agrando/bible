And the king answered them, saying: The word is true according to the decree of the Medes and Persians, which it is not lawful to violate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they answered, and said before the king: Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Juda, hath not regarded thy law, nor the decree that thou hast made: but three times a day he maketh his prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the king had heard these words, he was very much grieved, and in behalf of Daniel he set his heart to deliver him and even till sunset he laboured to save him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But those mer. perceiving the king's design, said to him: Know thou, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree which the king hath made, may be altered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of the lions. And the king said to Daniel: Thy God, whom thou always servest, he will deliver thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den: which the king sealed with his own ring, and with the ring of his nobles, that nothing should be done against Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king went away to his house and laid himself down without taking supper, and meat was not set before him, and even sleep departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the king rising very early in the morning, went in haste to the lions' den:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And coming near to the den, cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel, and said to him: Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou servest always, been able, thinkest thou, to deliver thee from the lions?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Daniel answering the king, said: O king, live for ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him justice hath been found in me: yea and before thee, O king, I have done no offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and he commanded that Daniel should be taken out of the den: and Daniel was taken out of the den, and no hurt was found in him, because he believed in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And by the king's commandment, those men were brought that bad accused Daniel: and they were cast into the lions' den, they and their children, and their wives: and they did not reach the bottom of the den, before the lions caught them, and broke all their bones in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then king Darius wrote to all people, tribes, and languages, dwelling in the whole earth: PEACE be multiplied unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It is decreed by me, that in all my empire and my kingdom all men dread and fear the God of Daniel. For he is the living and eternal God for ever: and his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his power shall be for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is the deliverer, and saviour, doing signs and wonders in heaven, and in earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions' den.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Daniel continued unto the reign of Darius, and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
