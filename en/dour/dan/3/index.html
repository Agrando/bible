And they stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then a herald cried with a strong voice: To you it is commanded, O nations, tribes, and languages:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and of the flute, and of the harp, of the sackbut, and of the psaltery, and of the symphony, and of all kind of music; ye fall down and adore the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if any man shall not fall down and adore, he shall the same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Upon this therefore, at the time when all the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music: all the nations, tribes, and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And said to king Nabuchodonosor: O king, live for ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou, O king, hast made a decree that every man that shall bear the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, shall prostrate himself, and adore the golden statue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And that if any man shall not fall down and adore, he should be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago: these men, O king, have slighted thy decree: they worship not thy gods, nor do they adore the golden statue which thou hast set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should be brought: who immediately were brought before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them, and said: Is it true, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor adore the golden statue that I have set up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and symphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the statue which I have made: but if you do not adore, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago answered and said to king Nabuchodonosor: We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire, and to deliver us out of thy hands, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if he will not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not worship thy gods, nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury: and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had been accustomed to be heated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the furnace of burning fire, with their coats, and their caps, and their shoes, and their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace was heated exceedingly. And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Nabuchodonosor the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles: Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, and said: True, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered, and said: Behold I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt in them, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Nabuchodonosor came to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and said: Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, ye servants of the most high God, go ye forth, and come. And immediately Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago went out from the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the nobles, and the magistrates, and the judges, and the great men of the king being gathered together, considered these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, and that not a hair of their head had been singed, nor their garments altered, nor the smell of the fire had passed on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth, said: Blessed be the God of them, to wit, of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that believed in him: and they changed the king's word, and delivered up their bodies that they might not serve, nor adore any god, except their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By me therefore this decree is made, that every people, tribe, and tongue, which shall speak blasphemy against the God of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, shall be destroyed, and their houses laid waste: for there is no other God that can save in this manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king promoted Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
