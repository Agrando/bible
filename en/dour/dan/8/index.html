I Daniel, after what I had seen in the beginning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up. Afterward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I understood: and behold a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he touched not the ground, and the he goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he was come near the ram, he was enraged against him, and struck the ram: and broke his two horns, and the ram could not withstand him: and when he had cast him down on the ground, he stamped upon him, and none could deliver the ram out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the he goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And out of one of them came forth a little horn: and it became great against the south, and against the east, and against the strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven: and it threw down of the strength, and of the stars, and trod upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength: and it took away from him the continual sacrifice, and cast down the place of his sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice, because of sins: and truth shall be cast down on the ground, and he shall do and shall prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another, I know not to whom that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and he called, and said: Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the he goat, is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it: four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou therefore seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I Daniel languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king's business, and I was astonished at the vision, and there was none that could interpret it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
