And when he had said this word to me, I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to me: Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the sight of thy God, thy words have been heard: and I am come for thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one and twenty days: and behold Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the Persians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I am come to teach thee what things shall befall thy people in the latter days, for as yet the vision is for days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he was speaking such words to me, I cast down my countenance to the ground, and held my peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, as it were the likeness of a son of man touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me: O my Lord, at the sight of thee my joints are loosed, and no strength hath remained in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord? for no strength remaineth in me, moreover my breath is stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore he that looked like a man touched me again, and strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said: Fear not, O man of desires, peace be to thee: take courage and be strong. And when he spoke to me, I grew strong: and I said: Speak, O my lord, for thou hast strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said: Dost thou know wherefore I am come to thee? and now I will return, to fight against the prince of the Persians. When I went forth, there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will tell thee what is set down in the scripture of truth: and none is my helper in all these things, but Michael your prince.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
