always living to make intercession for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, in offering himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath, which was since the law, the Son who is perfected for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
