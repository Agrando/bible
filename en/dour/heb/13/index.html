For fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have; for he hath said: I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you; whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ, yesterday, and to day; and the same for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the heart be established with grace, not with meats; which have not profited those that walk in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have an altar, whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And do not forget to do good, and to impart; for by such sacrifices God's favour is obtained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Salute all your prelates, and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Grace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
