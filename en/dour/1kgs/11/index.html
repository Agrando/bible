And to these was Solomon joined with a most ardent love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he had seven hundred wives as queens, and three hundred concubines: and the women turned away his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he was now old, his heart was turned away by women to follow strange gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Solomon worshipped Astarthe the goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch the idol of the ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Solomon did that which was net pleasing before the Lord, and did not fully follow the Lord, as David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Solomon built a temple for Chamos the idol of Moab, on the hill that is over against Jerusalem, and for Moloch the idol of the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he did in this manner for all his wives that were strangers, who burnt incense, and offered sacrifice to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his mind was turned away from the Lord the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not follow strange gods: but he kept not the things which the Lord commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord therefore said to Solomon: Because thou hast done this, and hast not kept my covenant, and my precepts, which I have commanded thee, I will divide and rend thy kingdom, and will give it to thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Nevertheless in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Neither will I take away the whole kingdom, but I will give one tribe to thy son for the sake of David my servant, and Jerusalem which I have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Adad the Edomite of the king's seed, in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For when David was in Edom, and Joab the general of the army was gone up to bury them that were slain, and had killed every male in Edom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(For Joab remained there six months with all Israel, till he had slain every male in Edom,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Adad fled, he and certain Edomites, of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt: and Adad was then a little boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they arose out of Madian, and came into Pharan, and they took men with them from Pharan, and went into Egypt to Pharao the king of Egypt: who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and assigned him land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Adad found great favour before Pharao, insomuch that he gave him to wife, the own sister of his wife Taphnes the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son Genubath, and Taphnes brought him up in the house of Pharao: and Genubath dwelt with Pharao among his children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Adad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the general of the army was dead, he add to Pharao: Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Pharao said to him: Why, what is wanting to thee with me, that thou seekest to go to thy own country? But he answered: Nothing: yet I beseech thee to let me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>God also raised up against him an adversary, Razon the son of Eliada, 'who had fled from his master Adarezer the king of Soba:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gathered men against him, and he became a captain of robbers, when David slew them of Soba: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and they made him king in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he was an adversary to Israel, all the days of Solomon: and this is the evil of Adad, and his hatred against Israel, and he reigned in Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeroboam also the son of Nabat an Ephrathite of Sareda, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was named Sarua, a widow woman, lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this is the cause of his rebellion against him, for Solomon built Mello, and filled up the breach of the city of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jeroboam was a valiant and mighty man: and Solomon seeing him a young man ingenious and industrious, made him chief over the tributes of all the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So it came to paste at that time, that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahias the Silonite, clad with a new garment, found him in the way: and they two were alone in the held.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahias taking his new garment, wherewith he was clad, divided it into twelve parts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>,31And he said to Jeroboam: Take to thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Behold I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give thee ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant David, and Jerusalem the city, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because he hath forsaken me, and hath adored Astarthe the goddess of the Sidonians, and Chamos the god of Moab, and Moloch the god of the children of Ammon: and hath not walked in my ways, to do justice before me, and to keep my precepts, and judgments as did David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my precepts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But I will take away the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give thee ten tribes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And to his son I will give one tribe, that there may remain a lamp for my servant David before me always in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen, that my name might be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do what is right before me, keeping my commandments and my precepts, as David my servant did: I will be with thee, and will build thee up a faithful house, as I built a house for David, and I will deliver Israel to thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but yet not for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam: but he arose, and fled into Egypt to Sesac the king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the rest of the words of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom: behold they are all written in the book of the words of the days of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel, were forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father, and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
