But thou art a wise man, and knowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty gears: in Hebron he reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Adonias the son of Haggith came to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon. And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? he answered: Peaceable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him: Speak. And he said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou knowest that the kingdom was nine, and all Israel had preferred me to be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is become my brother's: for it was appointed him by the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore I ask one petition of thee: turn not away my face. And she said to him: Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said: I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny thee any thing) to give me Abisag the Sunamitess to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias: and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee, do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother, ask: for I must not turn away thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said: Let Abisag the Sunamitess be given to Adonias thy brother to wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag the Sunamitess for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom: for he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Sarvia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: So and so may God do to me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his own life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And now as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed me upon the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonias shall be put to death this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias the son of Joiada, who slew him, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king said also to Abiathar the priest: Go to Anathoth to thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my father endured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Solomon cast out Abiathar, from being the priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Deli in Silo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord and laid hold on the horn of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and was by the altar: and Solomon sent Banaias the son of Joiada, saying: Go, kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him: Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said: I will not come forth, but here I will die. Banaias brought word back to the king, saying: Thus saith Joab, and thus he answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king said to him: Do as he hath said: and kill him, and bury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab, from me, and from the house of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head, because he murdered two men, just and better than himself: and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing it, Abner the son of Ner, general of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, general of the army of Juda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And their blood shall return the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever. But to David and his seed and his house, and to his throne be peace for ever from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Banaias the son of Joiada went up, and setting upon him slew him, and he was buried in his house in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the king appointed Banaias the son of Joiada in his room over the army, and Sadoc the priest he put in the place of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there: and go not out from thence any whither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the brook Cedron, know that thou shalt be put to death: thy blood shall be upon thy own head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Semei said to the king: The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem, many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis the son of Maacha the king of Geth: and it was told Semei that his servants were gone to Geth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis to Geth to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it was told Solomon that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth, and was come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest to thee by the Lord, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt go out and walk abroad any whither, know that thou shalt die? And thou answeredst me: The word that I have heard is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I laid upon thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the king said to Semei: Thou knowest all the evil, of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David my father: the Lord hath returned thy wickedness upon thy own head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So the king commanded Banaias the son of Joiada: and he went out and struck him, and he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
