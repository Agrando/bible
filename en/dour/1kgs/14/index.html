So when she was coming in, and made as if she were another woman,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ahias heard the sound of her feet coming in at the door, and said: Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam: why dost thou feign thyself to be another? But I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, and tell Jeroboam: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to thee, and thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and followed me with all his heart, doing that which was well pleasing in my sight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast made thee strange gods and molten gods, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore behold I will bring evils upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut of from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the last in Israel: and I will sweep away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as dung is swept away till all be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Them that shall die of Jeroboam in the city, the dogs shall eat: and them that shall die in the field, the birds of the air shall devour: for the Lord hath spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Arise thou therefore, and go to thy house: and when thy feet shall be entering into the city, the child shall die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall be laid in a sepulchre, be- cause in his regard there is found a good word from the Lord the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Lord hath appointed himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam in this day, and in this time:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord God shall strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water: and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river: because they have made to themselves groves, to provoke the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Lord shall give up Israel for the sins of Jeroboam, who hath sinned, and made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the wife of Jeroboam arose, and departed, and came to Thersa: and when she was coming in to the threshold of the house, the child died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they buried him.
