And when he was come to the gate of the city, he saw the widow woman gathering sticks, and he called her, and said to her: Give me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she was going to fetch it he called after her, saying: Bring me also, I beseech thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she answered: As the Lord thy God liveth, I have no bread, but only a handful of meal in a pot, and a little oil in a cruse: behold I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it, for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elias said to her: Fear not, but go, and do as thou hast said: but first make for me of the same meal a little hearth cake, and bring it to me: and after make for thyself and thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: The pot of meal shall not waste, nor the cruse of oil be diminished, until the day wherein the Lord will give rain upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She went and did according to the word of Elias: and he ate, and she, and her house: and from that day</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The pot of meal wasted not, and the cruse of oil was not diminished, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke in the hand of Elias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass after this that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick, and the sickness was very grievous, so that there was no breath left in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said to Elias: What have I to do with thee, thou man of God? art thou come to me that my iniquities should be remembered, and that thou shouldst kill my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Elias said to her: Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him into the upper chamber where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he cried to the Lord, and said: O Lord my God, hast thou afflicted also the widow, with whom I am after a so maintained, so as to kill her son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he stretched, and measured himself upon the child three times, and cried to the Lord, and said: 0 Lord my God, let the soul of this child, I beseech thee, return into his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Lord heard the voice of Elias: and the soul of the child returned into him, and he revived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elias took the child, and brought him down from the upper chamber to the house below, and delivered him to his mother, and said to her: Behold thy son liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman said to Elias: Now, by this I know that thou art a man of God, and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is true.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
