And I saw that this also was vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors and folly, (What is man, said I, that he can follow the King his maker?)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool for ever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are evil, and all vanity and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under the sun, being like to have an heir after me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool, and he shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and is there any thing so vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring any more under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit, with which he bath been tormented under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All his days axe full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth not rest in mind: and is not this vanity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Is it not better to eat and drink, and to shew his soul good things of his labours? and this is from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>God hath given to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and superfluous care, to heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased God: but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the mind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
