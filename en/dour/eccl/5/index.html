For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Dreams follow many cares: and in many words shall be found folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If thou hast vowed any thing to God, defer not to pay it: for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him: but whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it is much better not to vow, than after a vow not to perform the things promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin: and say not before the angel: There is no providence: lest God be angry at thy words, and destroy all the works of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and words without number: but do thou fear God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor, and violent judgments, and justice perverted in the province, wonder not at this matter: for he that is high hath another higher, and there are others still higher than these:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money: and he that loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them: so this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Where there are great riches, there are also many to eat them. And what doth it profit the owner, but that he seeth the riches with his eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sleep is sweet to a labouring man, whether he eat lttle or much: but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is also another grievous evil, which I have seen under the sun: riches kept to the hurt of the owner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For they are lost with very great affliction: he hath begotten a son, who shall be in extremity of want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As he came forth naked from his mother's womb, so shall he return, and shall take nothing away with him of his labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A most deplorable evil: as he came, so shall he return. What then doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>All the days of his life he eateth in darkness, and in many cares, and in misery, and sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This therefore hath seemed good to me, that a man should eat and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, wherewith he hath laboured under the sun, all the days of his life, which God hath given him: and this is his portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And every man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to enjoy his portion, and to rejoice of his labour: this is the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God entertaineth his heart with delight,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
