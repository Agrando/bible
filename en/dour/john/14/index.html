You believe in God, believe also in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In my Father's house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, you also may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And whither I go you know, and the way you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him, and you have seen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father, and it is enough for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you; and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also. How sayest thou, Shew us the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Otherwise believe for the very works' sake. Amen, amen I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do; and greater than these shall he do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If you love me, keep my commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father's who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go hence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
