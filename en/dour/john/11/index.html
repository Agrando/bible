If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
