Art thou Elias? And he said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said therefore unto him: Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said: I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they that were sent, were of the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him, and said to him: Why then dost thou baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying: I baptize with water; but there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The same is he that shall come after me, who is preferred before me: the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day, John saw Jesus coming to him, and he saith: Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he, of whom I said: After me there cometh a man, who is preferred before me: because he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I knew him not, but that he may be made manifest in Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John gave testimony, saying: I saw the Spirit coming down, as a dove from heaven, and he remained upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptize with water, said to me: He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I saw, and I gave testimony, that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next day again John stood, and two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And beholding Jesus walking, he saith: Behold the Lamb of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jesus turning, and seeing them following him, saith to them: What seek you? Who said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He saith to them: Come and see. They came, and saw where he abode, and they stayed with him that day: now it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who had heard of John, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He findeth first his brother Simon, and saith to him: We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said: Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On the following day, he would go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip. And Jesus saith to him: Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him: We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him: Can any thing of good come from Nazareth? Philip saith to him: Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him: and he saith of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael saith to him: Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered, and said to him: Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered him, and said: Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered, and said to him: Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believest: greater things than these shalt thou see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he saith to him: Amen, amen I say to you, you shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
