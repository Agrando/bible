And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the works themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him you believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And you will not come to me that you may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I receive glory not from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe, who receive glory one from another: and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
