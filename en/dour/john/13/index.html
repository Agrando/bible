And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He therefore having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself; and immediately will he glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
