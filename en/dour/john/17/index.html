Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee.
