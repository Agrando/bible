But what sayest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they understood not, that he called God his Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When he spoke these things, many believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you shall be free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if I say the truth, you believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it, and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
