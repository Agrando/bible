But they understood not what he spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them said: He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear you him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews then took up stones to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first; and there he abode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many resorted to him, and they said: John indeed did no sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were true. And many believed in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
