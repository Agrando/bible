He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
