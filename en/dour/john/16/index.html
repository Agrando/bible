And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Of sin: because they believed not in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall see me no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then some of the disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
