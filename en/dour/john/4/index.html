Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 17 The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>dummy verses inserted by amos</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed in him because of his own word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
