Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
