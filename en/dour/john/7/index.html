If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done; and you all wonder:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I am not come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But of the people many believed in him, and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this man doth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night, who was one of them:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And every man returned to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
