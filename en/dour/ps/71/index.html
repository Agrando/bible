Of the sons of Jonadab, and the former captives. In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to confusion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>deliver me in thy justice, and rescue me. Incline thy ear unto me, and save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength: that thou mayst make me safe. For thou art my firmament and my refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, and out of the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thou art my patience, O Lord: my hope, O Lord, from my youth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: from my mother's womb thou art my protector. Of thee shall I continually sing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I run become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; thy greatness all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For my enemies have spoken against me; and they that watched my soul have consulted together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>O God, be not thou far from me: O my God, make haste to my help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul; let them be covered with confusion and shame that seek my hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I will always hope; and will add to all thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; thy salvation all the day long. Because I have not knows learning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will enter into the powers of the Lord: O Lord, I will be mindful of thy justice alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth: and till now I will declare thy wonderful works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And unto old age and grey hairs: O God, forsake me not, Until I shew forth thy arm to all the generation that is to come: Thy power,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou hast done: O God, who is like to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and turning thou hast brought me to life, and hast brought me back again from the depths of the earth :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; and turning to me thou hast comforted me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of psaltery: O God, I will sing to thee with the harp, thou holy one of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; and my soul which thou hast redeemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; when they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
