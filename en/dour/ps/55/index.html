I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>at the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for among many they were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>he hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>they are divided by the wrath Of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
