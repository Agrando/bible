And they that were near me stood afar off :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I, as a deaf man, heard not : and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I became as a man that heareth not : and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped : thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me : and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I am ready for scourges : and my sorrow is continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I will declare my inequity : and I will think for my sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But my enemies live, and are stronger that I : and they hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I followed goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Forsake me not, O Lord my God : do not thou depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
