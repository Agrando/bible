The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life: of whom shall I be afraid?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh. My enemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart shall not fear. If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be confident.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies. I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: I will sing, and recite a psalm to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee: have mercy on me and hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: thy face, O Lord, will I still seek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy servant. Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord hath taken me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Expect the Lord, do manfully, and let thy heart take courage, and wait thou for the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
