The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God, They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they acted deceitfully; the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their ways: and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
