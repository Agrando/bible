Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In thee have our fathers hoped: they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They cried to thee, and they were saved: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I am a worm, and no man: the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I was cast upon thee from the womb.
