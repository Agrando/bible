Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Turn not man away to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the light of thy countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be considered spider:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is labour and sorrow. For mildness is come upon us: and we shall be corrected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>can number thy wrath? So make thy right hand known: and men learned in heart, in wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated in favour of thy servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for the years in which we have seen evils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
