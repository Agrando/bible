And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear : and they shall hope in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God : and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have spoken they are multiplied above number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast pierced ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>then said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written of me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that I should do thy will : O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not restrain my lips : O Lord, thou knowest it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have not hid thy justice within my heart : I have declared thy truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me : thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head : and my heart hath forsaken me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me, look down, O Lord, to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that desire evils to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me : 'T is well, 't is well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say always : The Lord be magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I am a beggar and poor : the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector : O my God, be not slack.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
