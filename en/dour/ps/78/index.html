Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse end exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might, not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: band the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And he chose his servant David, and took him from the hocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>To feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
