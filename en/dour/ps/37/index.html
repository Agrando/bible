Be not emulous of evildoers; nor envy them that work iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For they shall shortly wither away as grass, and as the green herbs shall quickly fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Trust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be subject to the Lord and pray to him Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and leave rage; have no emulation to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the evildoers shall be cut off : but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be : and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight in abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sinner shall watch the just man : and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the Lord shall laugh at him : for he foreseeth that his day shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword : they have bent their bow. To cast down the poor and needy, to kill the upright of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let their sword enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is a little to the just, than the great riches of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; but the Lord strengtheneth the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord knoweth the days of undefiled; and their inheritance shall be for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because the wicked shall perish.
