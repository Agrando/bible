A psalm for David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain like a sparrow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow; they have prepared their arrows in the quiver; to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The sinner hath provoked the Lord according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what has the just man done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone and storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He sitteth in ambush with the rich in private places, that he may kill the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath beheld righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His eyes are upon the poor man: He lieth in wait in secret like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush that he may catch the poor man: to catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face not to see to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
