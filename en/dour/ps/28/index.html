Unto thee will I cry, O Lord: O my God, be not thou silent to me: lest thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee; when I lift up my hands to thy holy temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Draw me not away together with the wicked; and with the workers of iniquity destroy me not: Who speak peace with their neighbour, but evils are in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of their inventions. According to the works of their hands give thou to them: render to them their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands: thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Lord is my helper and my protector: in him hath my heart confided, and I have been helped.
