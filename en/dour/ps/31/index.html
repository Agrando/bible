Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name's sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: for thou art my protector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou best regarded my humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am forgotten as one dead from the heart. I am become as a vessel that is destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While they assembled together against me, they consulted to take away my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; and from them that persecute me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let deceitful lips be made dumb. Which speak iniquity against the just, with pride and abuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, in the sight of the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the disturbance of men. Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
