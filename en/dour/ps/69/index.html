I am come into the depth of the sea: and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are not hidden from thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of my mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank wine made me their song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time of thy good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumblingblock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend thou down always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into thy justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath set me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will magnify him with praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it shall please God better than a young calf, that bringeth forth horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For God will save Sion, and the cities of Juda shall be built up. And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the seed of his servants shall possess it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
