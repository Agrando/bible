Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be moved for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains shall the waters stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which thou hast founded for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall expect in their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man's heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>there the sparrows shall make their nests. The highest of them is the house of the heron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the irchins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: and they shall lie down in their dens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>How great are thy works, O Lord? thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number: Creatures little and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let my speech be acceptable to him: but I will take delight in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more: O my soul, bless thou the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
