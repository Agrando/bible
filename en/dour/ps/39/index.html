I have set guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things : and my sorrow was renewed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart grew hot within me : and in my meditation a fire shall flame out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I spoke with my tongue : O Lord, make me know my end. And what is the number of my days : that I may know what is wanting to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold thou hast made my days measurable : and my substance is as nothing before thee. And indeed all things are vanity : every man living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Surely man passeth as an image : yea, and he is disquieted in vain. He storeth up : and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my substance is with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Deliver thou me from all my iniquities : thou hast made me a reproach to the fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Remove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand hath made me faint in rebukes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>thou hast corrected man for iniquity. And thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider : surely in vain is any man disquieted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication : give ear to my tears. Be not silent : for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be no more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
