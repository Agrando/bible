heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great army, to invade the land of Juda, and to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And seeing that the people was in dread, and in fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and assembled the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And exhorted them, saying: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought for the laws, and the sanctuary, and the distresses that we have seen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>By reason whereof all my brethren have lost their lives for Israel's sake, and I am left alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now far be it from me to spare my life in any time of trouble: for I am not better than my brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will avenge then my nation and the sanctuary, and our children, and wives: for all the heathens are gathered together to destroy us out of mere malice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the spirit of the people was enkindled as soon as they heard these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they answered with a loud voice, saying: Thou art our leader in the place of Judas, and Jonathan thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Fight thou our battles, and we will do whatsoever thou shalt say to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So gathering together all the men of war, he made haste to finish all the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he sent Jonathan the son of Absalom, and with him a new army into Joppe, and he cast out them that were in it, and himself remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a great army, to invade the land of Juda, and Jonathan was with him in custody.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Simon pitched in Addus, over against the plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Tryphon understood that Simon was risen up in the place of his brother Jonathan, and that he meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Saying: We have detained thy brother Jonathan for the money that he owed in the king's account, by reason of the affairs which he had the management of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now send a hundred talents of silver, and his two sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Simon knew that he spoke deceitfully to him, nevertheless he ordered the money, and the children to be sent: lest he should bring upon himself a great hatred of the people of Israel, who might have said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because he sent not the money, and the children, therefore is he lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he sent the children, and the hundred talents: and he lied, and did not let Jonathan go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after this Tryphon entered within the country, to destroy it: and they went about by the way that leadeth to Ador: and Simon and his army marched to every place whithersoever they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they that were in the castle, sent messengers to Tryphon, that he should make haste to come through the desert, and sent them victuals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, and he came not into the country of Galaad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he approached to Bascama, he slew Jonathan and his sons there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Tryphon returned, and went into his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, in the city of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation: and they mourned for him many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his brethren, a building lofty to the sight, of polished stone behind and before:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he set up seven pyramids one against another for his father and his mother, and his four brethren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And round about these he set great pillars: and upon the pillars arms for a perpetual memory: and by the arms ships carved, which might be seen by all that sailed on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is the sepulchre that he made in Modin even unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Tryphon when he was upon a journey with the young king Antiochus, treacherously slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he reigned in his place, and put on the crown of Asia: and brought great evils upon the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Simon built up the strong holds of Judea, fortifying them with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars: and he stored up victuals in the fortresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Simon chose men and sent to king Demetrius, to the end that he should grant an immunity to the land: for all that Tryphon did was to spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And king Demetrius in answer to this request, wrote a letter in this manner:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>King Demetrius to Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, and to the ancients, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The golden crown, and the palm, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a firm peace with you, and to write to the king's chief officers to release you the things that we have released.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For all that we have decreed in your favour, shall stand in force. The strong holds that you have built, shall be your own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And as for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown which you owed: and if any other thing were taxed in Jerusalem, now let it not be taxed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In the year one hundred and seventy the yoke of the Gentiles was taken off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the people of Israel began to write in the instruments, and public records, The first year under Simon the high priest, the great captain and prince of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>In those days Simon besieged Gaza, and camped round about it, and he made engines, and set them to the city, and he struck one tower, and took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they that were within the engine leaped into the city: and there was a great uproar in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they that were in the city went up with their wives and children upon the wall, with their garments rent, and they cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they said: Deal not with us according to our evil deeds, but according to thy mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Simon being moved, did not destroy them: but yet he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein there had been idols, and then he entered into it with hymns, blessing the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And having cast out of it all uncleanness, he placed in it men that should observe the law: and he fortified it, and made it his habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But they that were in the castle of Jerusalem were hindered from going out and coming into the country, and from buying and selling: and they were straitened with hunger, and many of them perished through famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they cried to Simon form peace, and he granted it to them: and he cast them out from thence, and cleansed the castle from uncleannesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, in the year one hundred and seventy-one, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and harps, and cymbals, and psalteries, and hymns, and canticles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he ordained that these days should be kept every year with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he fortified the mountain of the temple that was near the castle, and he dwelt there himself, and they that were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man for war: and he made him captain of all the forces: and he dwelt in Gazara.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
