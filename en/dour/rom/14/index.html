For God hath taken him to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day: let every man abound in his own sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother's way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not then our good be evil spoken of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he that in this serveth Christ, pleaseth God, and is approved of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace; and keep the things that are of edification one towards another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or made weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
