and magnify him, all ye people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing; that you may abound in hope, and in the power of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind: because of the grace which is given me from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles; sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of, shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to you, and have been kept away till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now having no more place in these countries, and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that as I pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither by you, if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea, and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
