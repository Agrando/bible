For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences, unto justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if by one man's offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
