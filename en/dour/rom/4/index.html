Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God reputeth justice without works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sara.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
