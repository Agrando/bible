But if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband; so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ; that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now we are loosed from the law of death, wherein we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid. But I do not know sin, but by the law; for I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not covet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin revived,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me, and by it killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it may appear sin, by that which is good, wrought death in me; that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that which I work, I understand not. For I do not that good which I will; but the evil which I hate, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law, that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good. For to will, is present with me; but to accomplish that which is good, I find not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil which I will not, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
