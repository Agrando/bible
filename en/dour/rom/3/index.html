First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>(I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it is written: There is not any man just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet swift to shed blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and misery in their ways:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the way of peace they have not known:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
