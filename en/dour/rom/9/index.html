Is there injustice with God? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will; and whom he will, he hardeneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find fault? for who resisteth his will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Even us, whom also he hath called, nor only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not obtained mercy, one that hath obtained mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall be, in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaias crieth out concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he shall finish his word, and cut it short in justice; because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom, and we had been like unto Gomorrha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who followed not after justice, have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As it is written: Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and a rock of scandal; and whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
