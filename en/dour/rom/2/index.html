For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who will render to every man according to his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For there is no respect of persons with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to themselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
