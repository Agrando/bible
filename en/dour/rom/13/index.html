And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he is God's minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
