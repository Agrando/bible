But he was silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but few are chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou dost not regard the person of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They say to him: Caesar's. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God, the things that are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And hearing this they wondered, and leaving him, went their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying: Master, Moses said: If a man die having no son, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up issue to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first having married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In like manner the second, and the third, and so on to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be? for they all had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answering, said to them: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married; but shall be as the angels of God in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken by God, saying to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the multitudes hearing it, were in admiration at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the greatest and the first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying: What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him: David's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
