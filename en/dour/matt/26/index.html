But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared the pasch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they being very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: it were better for him, if that man had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be scandalized in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving him, fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
