For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And his countenance was as lightning, and his raiment as snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror, and became as dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen: and behold he will go before you into Galilee; there you shall see him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold Jesus met them, saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet, and adored him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, there they shall see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who when they were departed, behold some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all things that had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel, gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Saying: Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away when we were asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if the governor shall hear this, we will persuade him, and secure you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they taking the money, did as they were taught: and this word was spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And seeing them they adored: but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
