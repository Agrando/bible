For they make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge their fringes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they love the first places at feasts, and the first chairs in the synagogues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And salutations in the market place, and to be called by men, Rabbi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But be not you called Rabbi. For one is your master; and all you are brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Neither be ye called masters; for one is you master, Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled: and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men, for you yourselves do not enter in; and those that are going in, you suffer not to enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: because you devour the houses of widows, praying long prayers. For this you shall receive the greater judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you go round about the sea and the land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, you make him the child of hell twofold more than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Woe to you blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but he that shall swear by the gold of the temple, is a debtor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ye foolish and blind; for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, is a debtor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things that are upon it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whosoever shall swear by temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth in it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you tithe mint, and anise, and cummin, and have left the weightier things of the law; judgment, and mercy, and faith. These things you ought to have done, and not to leave those undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but within you are full of rapine and uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou blind Pharisee, first make clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside may become clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you are like to whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear to men beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones, and of all filthiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So you also outwardly indeed appear to men just; but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; that build the sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the just,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And say: If we had been in the days of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Wherefore you are witnesses against yourselves, that you are the sons of them that killed the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You serpents, generation of vipers, how will you flee from the judgment of hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore behold I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you will put to death and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the just, even unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Amen I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered together thy children, as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldest not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, you house shall be left to you, desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I say to you, you shall not see me henceforth till you say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
