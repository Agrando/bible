For it must needs be that scandals come: but nevertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal cometh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if thy hand, or thy foot scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee. It is better for thee to go into life maimed or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee. It is better for thee having one eye to enter into life, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>See that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>What think you? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them should go astray: doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and go to seek that which is gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if it so be that he find it: Amen I say to you, he rejoiceth more for that, than for the ninety-nine that went not astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so it is not the will of your Father, who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more: that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he will not hear them: tell the church. And if he will not hear the church, let him be to thee as the heathen and publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Amen I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say to you, that if two of you shall consent upon earth, concerning any thing whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be done to them by my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then came Peter unto him and said: Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus saith to him: I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a king, who would take an account of his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had begun to take the account, one was brought to him, that owed him ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he had not wherewith to pay it, his lord commanded that he should be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But that servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the lord of that servant being moved with pity, let him go and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when that servant was gone out, he found one of his fellow servants that owed him an hundred pence: and laying hold of him, throttled him, saying: Pay what thou owest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And his fellow servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he paid the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much grieved, and they came and told their lord all that was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord called him; and said to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shouldst not thou then have had compassion also on thy fellow servant, even as I had compassion on thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his lord being angry, delivered him to the torturers until he paid all the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So also shall my heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
