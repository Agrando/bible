For this is the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every one that heareth these my words, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
