For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I indeed baptize you in the water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfill all justice. Then he suffered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him: and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
