And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When therefore they were come, that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every man a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Saying: These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answering said to one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thy eye evil, because I am good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So shall the last be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart, and said to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He saith to them: My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them to him, and said: You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold two blind men sitting by the way side, heard that Jesus passed by, and they cried out, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace. But they cried out the more, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus stood, and called them, and said: What will ye that I do to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They say to him: Lord, that our eyes be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus having compassion on them, touched their eyes. And immediately they saw, and followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
