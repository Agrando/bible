Therefore it it lawful to do a good deed on the sabbath days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand; and he stretched it forth, and it was restored to health even as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees going out made a consultation against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus knowing it, retired from thence: and many followed him, and he healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he charged them that they should not make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul hath been well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall not contend, nor cry out, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The bruised reed he shall not break: and smoking flax he shall not extinguish: till he send forth judgment unto victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name the Gentiles shall hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was offered to him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb: and he healed him, so that he spoke and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the multitudes were amazed, and said: Is not this the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the Pharisees hearing it, said: This man casteth not out the devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate: and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself: how then shall his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong, and rifle his goods, unless he first bind the strong? and then he will rifle his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree evil, and its fruit evil. For by the fruit the tree is known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O generation of vipers, how can you speak good things, whereas you are evil? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A good man out of a good treasure bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of an evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master we would see a sign from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights: so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas. And behold a greater than Jonas here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold >   ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Transfer interrupted!

And coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man in made worse than the first. So shall it be also to this wicked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And one said unto him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he answering him that told him, said: Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said: Behold my mother and my brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whosoever shall do the will of my Father, that is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
