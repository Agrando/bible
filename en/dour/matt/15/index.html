For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? For God said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say: Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he shall not honour his father or his mother: and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answering them, said: Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Peter answering, said to him: Expound to us this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said: Are you also yet without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grieviously troubled by the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she crieth after us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he answering, said: I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But she came and adored him, saying: Lord, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Who answering, said: It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answering, said to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea of Galilee. And going up into a mountain, he sat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others: and they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk, and the blind see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus called together his disciples, and said: I have compassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the disciples say unto him: Whence then should we have so many loaves in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them: How many loaves have you? But they said: Seven, and a few little fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they did all eat, and had their fill. And they took up seven baskets full, of what remained of the fragments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and came into the coasts of Magedan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
