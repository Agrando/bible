And they took up what remained, twelve full baskets of fragments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the number of them that did eat, was five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the boat, and to go before him over the water, till he dismissed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having dismissed the multitude, he went into a mountain alone to pray. And when it was evening, he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves: for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking upon the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they seeing him walk upon the sea, were troubled, saying: It is an apparition. And they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: Be of good heart: it is I, fear ye not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter making answer, said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said: Come. And Peter going down out of the boat, walked upon the water to come to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and when he began to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of him, and said to him: O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they were come up into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they that were in the boat came and adored him, saying: Indeed thou art the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having passed the water, they came into the country of Genesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent into all that country, and brought to him all that were diseased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment. And as many as touched, were made whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
