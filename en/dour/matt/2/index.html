For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to adore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And king Herod hearing this, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they said to him: In Bethlehem of Juda. For so it is written by the prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come forth the captain that shall rule my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod, privately calling the wise men, learned diligently of them the time of the star which appeared to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And sending them into Bethlehem, said: Go and diligently inquire after the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come to adore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they had seen in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they adored him; and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And having received an answer in sleep that they should not return to Herod, they went back another way into their country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and fly into Egypt: and be there until I shall tell thee. For it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt: and he was there until the death of Herod:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt have I called my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding angry; and sending killed all the men children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and great mourning; Rachel bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel. For they are dead that sought the life of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither: and being warned in sleep retired into the quarters of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was said by prophets: That he shall be called a Nazarene.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
