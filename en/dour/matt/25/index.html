thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold here thou hast that which is thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness.
