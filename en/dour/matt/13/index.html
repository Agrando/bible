And the servants said to him: Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said: No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable he proposed unto them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable he spoke to them: The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes: and without parables he did not speak to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then having sent away the multitudes, he came into the house, and his disciples came to him, saying: Expound to us the parable of the cockle of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Who made answer and said to them: He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the field, is the world. And the good seed are the children of the kingdom. And the cockle, are the children of the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the enemy that sowed them, is the devil. But the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Even as cockle therefore is gathered up, and burnt with fire: so shall it be at the end of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and them that work iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then shall the just shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field. Which a man having found, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good pearls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who when he had found one pearl of great price, went his way, and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea, and gathering together of all kind of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Which, when it was filled, they drew out, and sitting by the shore, they chose out the good into vessels, but the bad they cast forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall go out, and shall separate the wicked from among the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Have ye understood all these things? They say to him: Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He said unto them: Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like to a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass: when Jesus had finished these parables, he passed from thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogues, so that they wondered and said: How came this man by this wisdom and miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Jude:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence therefore hath he all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were scandalized in his regard. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he wrought not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
