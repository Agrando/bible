But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of blood, even to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they gave them unto the potter's field, as the Lord appointed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou sayest it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor wondered exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, king of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they sat and watched him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand, and one on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with him, reproached him with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And some that stood there and heard, said: This man calleth Elias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the others said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>He went to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting guards.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
