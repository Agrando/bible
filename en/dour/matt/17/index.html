And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them, Arise, and fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come first?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he answering, said to them: Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of man shall suffer from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man falling down on his knees before him, saying: Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffereth much: for he falleth often into the fire, and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Jesus answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said: Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For, amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they abode together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were troubled exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they were come to Capharnaum, they that recieved the didrachmas, came to Peter and said to him: Doth not your master pay the didrachmas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said: Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying: What is thy opinion, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom do they receive tribute or custom? of their own children, or of strangers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said: Of strangers. Jesus said to him: Then the children are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook: and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
