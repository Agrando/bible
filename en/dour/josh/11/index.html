And they defeated them, and chased them as far as the great Sidon, and the waters of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the east side thereof. He slew them all, so as to leave no remains of them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he did as the Lord had commanded him, he hamstringed their horses and burned their chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And presently turning back he took Asor: and slew the king thereof with the sword. Now Asor of old was the head of all these kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he cut off all the souls that abode there: he left not in it any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the city itself with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the cities round about, and their kings, as Moses the servant of God had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Except the cities that were on hills and high places, the rest Israel burned: only Asor that was very strong he consumed with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the children of Israel divided among themselves all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, killing all the men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Josue, and he accomplished all: he left not one thing undone of all the commandments which the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Josue took all the country of the hills, and of the south, and the land of Gosen, and the plains and the west country, and the mountain of Israel, and the plains thereof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir as far as Baalgad, by the plain of Libanus under mount Hermon: all their kings he took, smote and slew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Josue made war a long time against these kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was hot a city that delivered itself to the children of Israel, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon: for he took all by fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it was the sentence of the Lord, that their hearts should be hardened, and they should fight against Israel, and fall, and should not deserve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At that time Josue came and cut off the Enacims from the mountains, from Hebron, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the mountain of Juda and Israel, and destroyed their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He left not any of the stock of the Enacims, in the land of the children of Israel: except the cities of Gaza, and Geth, and Azotus, in which alone they were left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Josue took all the land, as the Lord spoke to Moses, and delivered it in possession to the children of Israel, according to their divisions and tribes.
