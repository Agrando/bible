So they did six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as it was ordered, seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets, Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath delivered the city to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to the Lord. Let only Rahab the harlot live, with all that are with her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of Israel be under sin, and be troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass and iron, let it be consecrated to the Lord, laid up in his treasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the walls forth- with fell down: and every man went up by the place that was over against him: s and they took the city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and old. The oxen also and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies: Go into the harlot's house, and bring her out, and all things that are hers, as you assured her by oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the young men went in and brought out Rahab, and her parents, her brethren also and all her goods and her kindred, and made them to stay without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they burned the city, and all things that were therein; except the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they consecrated into the treasury of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Josue saved Rahab the harlot and her father's house, and all she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day: because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho. At that time, Josue made an imprecation, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise up and build the city of Jericho. In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof, and in the last of his children set up its gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised throughout all the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
