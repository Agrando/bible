In all these things his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Woe to the Assyrian, he is the rod and the staff of my anger, and my indignation is in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will send him to a deceitful nation, and I will give him a charge against the people of my wrath, to take away the spoils, and to lay hold on the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But he shall not take it so, and his heart shall not think so: but his heart shall be set to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he shall say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Are not my princes as so many kings ?
