In a land of trouble and distress, from whence come the lioness, and the lion, the viper and the flying basilisk, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of beasts, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not be able to profit them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For Egypt shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this: It is pride only, sit still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore go in and write for them upon box, and note it diligently in a book, and it shall be in the latter days for a testimony for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is a people that provoketh to wrath, and lying children, children that will not hear the law of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who say to the seers: See not: and to them that behold: Behold not for us those things that are right: speak unto us pleasant things, see errors for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Take away from me the way, turn away the path from me, let the Holy One of Israel cease from before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: Because you have rejected this word, and have trusted in oppression and tumult, and have leaned upon it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore shall this iniquity be to you as a breach that falleth, and is found wanting in a high wall, for the destruction thereof shall come on a sudden, when it is not looked for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it shall be broken small, as the potter's vessel is broken all to pieces with mighty breaking, and there shall not a sherd be found of the pieces thereof, wherein a little fire may be carried from the hearth, or a, little water be drawn out of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel: If you return and be quiet, you shall be saved: in silence and in hope shall your strength be. And you would not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But have said: No, but we will flee to horses: therefore shall you flee. And we will mount upon swift ones: therefore shall they be swifter that shall pursue after you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A thousand men shall flee for fear of one: and for fear of five shall you flee, till you be left as the mast of a ship on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign upon a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore the Lord waiteth that be may have mercy on you: and therefore shall he be exalted sparing you: because the Lord is the God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the people of Sion shall dwell in Jerusalem: weeping thou shalt not weep, he will surely have pity on thee: at the voice of thy cry, se soon as he shell hear, he will answer thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord will give you spare bread, and short water: and will not cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and thy eyes shall see thy teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thy ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee behind thy back: This is the way, walk ye in it: and go not aside neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou shalt defile the plates of thy graven things of silver, and the garment of thy molten things of gold, and shalt cast them away as the uncleanness of a menstruous woman. Thou shalt say to it: Get thee hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And rain shall be given to thy seed, wheresoever thou shalt sow in the land: and the bread of the corn of the land shall be most plentiful, and fat. The lamb in that day shall feed at large in thy possession:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And thy oxen, and the ass colts that till the ground, shall eat mingled pro vender as it was winnowed in the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every elevated hill rivers of running waters in the day of the slaughter of many, when the tower shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the light of the moon shall be se the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days: in the day when the Lord shall bind up the wound of his people, and shall heal the stroke of their wound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold the name of the Lord cometh from afar, his wrath burneth, and is heavy to bear: his lips are filled with indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>His breath as a torrent overflowing even to the midst of the neck, to destroy the nations unto nothing, and the bridle of error that was in the jaws of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You shall have a song as in the night of the sanctified solemnity, and joy of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe, to come into the mountain of the Lord, to the Mighty One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Lord shall make the glory of his voice to be heard, and shall shew the terror of his arm, in the threatening of wrath, and the dame of devouring fire: he shall crush to pieces with whirlwind, and hailstones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For at the voice of the Lord the Assyrian shall fear being struck with the rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the passage of the rod shall be strongly grounded, which the Lord shall make to rest upon him with timbrels and harps, and in great battles he shall over throw them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For Topheth is prepared from yesterday, prepared by the king, deep, and wide. The nourishment thereof is fire and much wood: the breath of the Lord as a torrent of brimstone kindling it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
