When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come upon us: for we have placed our hope in lies, and by falsehood we are protected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will lay a stone in the foundations of Sion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded in the foundation. He that believeth, let him not hasten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set judgment in weight, and justice in measure: and hail shall overturn the hope of falsehood: and waters shall overflow its protection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Sour league with death shall be abolished, and your covenant with hell shall not stand: when the overflowing scourge shall pass, you shall be trodden down by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whensoever it shall pass through, it shall take you away: because in the morning early it shall pass through, in the day and in the night, and vexation alone shall make you understand what you hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the bed is straitened, so that one must fall out, and a short covering can- not cover both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the Lord shall stand up as in the mountain of divisions: he shall be angry as in the valley which is in Gabaon: that he may do his work, his strange work: that he may perform his work, his work is strange to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now do not mock, lest your bonds be tied strait. For I have heard of the Lord the God of hosts a consumption and a cutting short upon all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give ear, and hear my voice, hearken, and hear my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shall the ploughman plough all the day to sow, shall he open and harrow his ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Will he not, when he hath made plain the surface thereof, sow gith, and scatter cummin, and put wheat in order, and barley, and millet, and vetches in their bounds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he will instruct him in judgment : his God will teach him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For gith shall not be thrashed with saws, neither shall the cart wheel turn about upon cummin: but gith shall be beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But bread corn shall be broken small: but the thrasher shall not thrash it for ever, neither shall the cart wheel hurt it, nor break it with its teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also is come forth from the Lord God of hosts, to make his counsel wonderful, and magnify justice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
