I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination tome. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>if you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thy silver is turned into dress: thy wine is mingled with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, the run after rewards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow's cometh not in to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dress, and I will take away all thy tin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will restore thy judges se they were before, and thy counsellors as of old.
