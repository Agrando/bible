Is my hand shortened and become little, that I cannot redeem? or is there no strength in me to deliver? Behold at my rebuke I will make the sea a desert, I will turn the rivers into dry land: the fishes shall rot for want of water, and shall die for thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will clothe the heavens with darkness, and will make sackcloth their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord hath given me a learned tongue, that I should know how to uphold by word him that is weary: he wakeneth in the morning, in the morning he wakeneth my ear, that I may hear him as a master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord God hath opened my ear, and I do not resist: I have not gone back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have given my body to the strikers, and my cheeks to them that plucked them: I have not turned away my face from them that rebuked me, and spit upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Lord God is my helper, therefore am I not confounded: therefore have I set my face as a most hard rock, and I know that I shall not be confounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He is near that justifieth me, who will contend with me? let us stand together, who is my adversary? let him come near to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold the Lord God is my helper: who is he that shall condemn me?
