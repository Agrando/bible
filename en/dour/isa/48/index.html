I have shewn thee new things from that time, and things are kept which thou knowest not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not of old: and before the day, when thou heardest them not, lest thou shouldst say: Behold I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thou hast neither heard, nor known, neither was thy ear opened of old. For I know that transgressing thou wilt transgress, and I have called thee a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For my name's sake I will remove my wrath far off: and for my praise I will bridle thee, lest thou shouldst perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold I have refined thee, but not as silver, I have chosen thee in the furnace of poverty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my own sake, for my own sake will I do it, that I may not be blasphemed: and I will not give my glory to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken to me, O Jacob, and thou Israel whom I call: I am he, I am the first, and I am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My hand also hath founded the earth, and my right hand hath measured the heavens: I shall call them, and they shall stand together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Assemble yourselves together, all you, and hear: who among them hath declared these things? the Lord hath loved him, he will do his pleasure in Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I have spoken and called him: I have brought him, and his way is made prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come ye near unto me, and hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning: from the time before it was done, I was there, and now the Lord God hath sent me, and his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the Lord thy God that teach thee profitable things, that govern thee in the way that thou walkest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments: thy peace had been as a river, and thy justice as the waves of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And thy seed had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof: his name should not have perished, nor have been destroyed from before my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come forth out of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, declare it with the voice of joy: make this to be heard, and speak it out even to the ends of the earth. Say: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They thirsted not in the desert, when he led them out: he brought forth water out of the rock for them, and he clove the rock, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
