But if thou trust in Egypt, in chariots and in horsemen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And am I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it? The Lord said to me: Go up against this land, and destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Eliacim, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces: Speak to thy servants in the Syrian tongue: for we understand it: speak not to us in the Jews' language in the hearing of the people, that are upon the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Rabsaces said to them: Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee, to speak all these words; and not rather to the men that sit on the wall; that they may eat their own dung, and drink their urine with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said: Hear the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus saith the king: Let not Ezechias deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And let not Ezechias make you trust in the Lord, saying: The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not hearken to Ezechias: for thus said the king of the Assyrians: Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come out to me, and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his dg tree, and drink ye every one the water of his cistern,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Till I come and take you away to a land, like to your own, a land of corn and of wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Neither let Ezechias trouble you, saying: The Lord will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where is the god of Emath and of Arphad? where is the god of Sepharvaim? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who is there among all the gods of these lands, that hath delivered his country out of my hand, that the Lord may deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they held their peace, and answered him not a word. For the king had commanded, saying: answer him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Eliacim the son of Helcias, that was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe the son of Asaph the recorder, went in to Ezechias with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
