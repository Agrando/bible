How is the gold become dim, the finest colour is changed, the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beth. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter's hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ghimel. Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Daleth. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Vau. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Zain. Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, purer than milk, more ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Heth. Their face is now made blacker than coals, and they are not known in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is withered, and is become like wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Teth. It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than with them that died with hunger: for these pined away being consumed for want of the fruits of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jod. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Caph. The Lord hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Lamed. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed, that the adversary and the enemy should enter in by the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Mem. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nun. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they were defiled with blood: and when they could not help walking in it, they held up their skirts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Samech. Depart you that are defiled, they cried out to them: Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed, they said among the Gentiles: He will no more dwell among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Phe. The face of the Lord hath divided them, he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, neither had they pity on the ancient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ain. While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not able to save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Sade. Our steps have slipped in the way of our streets, our end draweth near: our days are fulfilled, for our end is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Coph. Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the air: they pursued us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Res. The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in our sins: to whom we said: Under thy shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Sin. Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Hus: to thee also shall the cup come, thou shalt be made drunk, and naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thau. Thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Sion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he visited thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he hath discovered thy sins.  The Prayer of Jeremias the Prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
