I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall and labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood, and the gall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou my judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their imaginations against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices against me all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
