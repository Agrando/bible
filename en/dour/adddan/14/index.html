And when he understood that Philip, who had been left over the affairs, had rebelled at Antioch, he was in a consternation of mind, and entreating the Jews, and yielding to them, he swore to all things that seemed reasonable, and, being reconciled, offered sacrifices, honoured the temple, and left gifts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He embraced Machabeus, and made him governor and prince from Ptolemais unto the Cerrenians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when he was come to Ptolemais, the men of that city were much displeased with the conditions of the peace, being angry for fear they should break the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Lysias went up to the judgment seat, and set forth the reason, and appeased the people, and returned to Antioch: and thus matters went with regard to the king's coming and his return.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
