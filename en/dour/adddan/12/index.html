In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the four and twentieth day of the month of Dioscorus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the king's letter contained these words: King Antiochus to Lysias his brother, greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Our father being translated amongst the gods, we are desirous that they that are in our realm should live quietly, and apply themselves diligently to their own concerns,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And we have heard that the Jews would not consent to my father to turn to the rites of the Greeks, but that they would keep to their own manner of living, and therefore that they request us to allow them to live after their own laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore being desirous that this nation also should be at rest, we have ordained and decreed, that the temple should be restored to them, and that they may live according to the custom of their ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thou shalt do well therefore to send to them, and grant them peace, that our pleasure being known, they may be of good comfort, and look to their own affairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the king's letter to the Jews was in this manner: King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews, and to the rest of the Jews, greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If you are well, you are as we desire, we ourselves also are well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Menelaus came to us, saying that you desired to come down to your countrymen, that are with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We grant therefore a safe conduct to all that come and go, until the thirtieth day of the month of Xanthicus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That the Jews may use their own Bind of meats, and their own laws as be- fore, and that none of them any manner of ways be molested for things which have been done by ignorance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we have sent also Menelaus to speak to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Fare ye well. In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Romans also sent them a letter, to this effect. Quintus Memmius, and Titus Manilius, ambassadors of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Whatsoever Lysias the king's cousin hath granted you, we also have granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But touching such things as he thought should be referred to the king, after you have diligently conferred among yourselves, send some one forthwith, that we may decree as it is convenient for you: for we are going to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And therefore make haste to write back, that we may know of what mind you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Fare ye well.
