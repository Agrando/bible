the barbarous multitude :</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And recovered again the most renowned temple in all the world, and delivered the city, and restored the laws that were abolished, the Lord with all clemency shewing mercy to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all such things as have been comprised in five books by Jason of Cyrene, we have attempted to abridge in one book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For considering the multitude of books, and the difficulty that they find that desire to undertake the narrations of histories, because of the multitude of the matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>We have taken care for those indeed that are willing to read, that it might be a pleasure of mind: and for the studious, that they may more easily commit to memory: and that all that read might receive profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as to ourselves indeed, in under- taking this work of abridging, we have taken in hand no easy task, yea rather a business full of watching and sweat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But as they that prepare a feast, and seek to satisfy the will of others: for the sake of many, we willingly undergo the labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Leaving to the authors the exact handling of every particular, and as for ourselves, according to the plan pro- posed, studying to be brief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as the master builder of a new house must have care of the whole building: but he that taketh care to paint it, must seek out fit things for the adorning of it: so must it be judged for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For to collect all that is to be known, to put the discourse in order, and curiously to discuss every particular point, is the duty of the author of a history:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But to pursue brevity of speech, and to avoid nice declarations of things, is to be granted to him that maketh an abridgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Here then we will begin the narration: let this be enough by way of a preface: for it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue, and to be short in the story itself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
