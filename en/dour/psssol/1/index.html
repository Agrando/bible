they walked in the midst of the flame, praising God and blessing the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Azarias standing up prayed in this manner, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of our fathers, and thy name is worthy of praise, and glorious for ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy works are true, and thy ways right, and all thy judgments true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon Jerusalem the holy city of our fathers: for according to truth and judgment, thou hast brought all these things upon us for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For we have sinned, and committed iniquity, departing from thee: and we have trespassed in all things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And we have not hearkened to thy commandments, nor have we observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us, that it might go well with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies that are unjust, and most wicked, and prevaricators, and to a king unjust, and most wicked beyond all that axe upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now we cannot open our mouths: we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants, and to them that worship thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Deliver us not up for ever, we beseech thee, for thy name's sake, and abolish not thy covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And take not away thy mercy from us for the sake of Abraham thy beloved, and Isaac thy servant, and Israel thy holy one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>To whom thou hast spoken, promising that thou wouldst multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we, O Lord, are diminished more than any nation, and are brought low in all the earth this day for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither is there at this time prince, or leader, or prophet, or holocaust, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place of firstfruits before thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That we may find thy mercy: nevertheless in a contrite heart and humble spirit let us be accepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As in holocausts of rams, and bullocks, and as in thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day, that it may please thee: for there is no confusion to them that trust in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now we follow thee with all our heart, and we fear thee, and seek thy face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Put us not to confusion, but deal. with us according to thy meekness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And deliver us according to thy wonderful works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And let all them be confounded that shew evils to thy servants, let them be confounded in all thy might, and let their strength be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, and glorious over all the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the king's servants that had cast them in, ceased not to heat the furnace with brimstone, and tow, and pitch, and dry sticks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the flame mounted up above the furnace nine and forty cubits:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it broke forth, and burnt such of the Chaldeans as it found near the furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the angel of the Lord went down with Azarias and his companions into the furnace: and he drove the flame of the fire out of the furnace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And made the midst of the furnace like the blowing of a wind bringing dew, and the fire touched them not at all, nor troubled them, nor did them any harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then these three as with one mouth praised, and glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of our fathers: and worthy to be praised, and glorified, and exalted above all for ever: and blessed is the holy name of thy glory: and worthy to be praised, and exalted above all in all ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory: and exceedingly to be praised, and exceeding glorious for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Blessed art thou on the throne of thy kingdom, and exceedingly to be praised, and exalted above all for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Blessed art thou, that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and worthy to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and worthy of praise, and glorious for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All ye works of the Lord, bless the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</span> <span
