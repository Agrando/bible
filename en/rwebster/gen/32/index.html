For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the present went over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, why is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
