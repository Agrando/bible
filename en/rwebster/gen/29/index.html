And they said, We are from Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep: for she kept them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nothing? tell me, what shall thy wages be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave to his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? why then hast thou deceived me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a wife also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband love me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and stopped bearing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
