Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Leah said, God hath bestowed on me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from there all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he removed that day the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hands of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and peeled white stripes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle striped, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban’s cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and female and male servants, and camels, and donkeys.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
