And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given to thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me and the children are able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the people that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built for himself an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he bought the piece of land, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he built there an altar, and called it Elelohe–Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
