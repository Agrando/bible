If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and arose, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slaughter a beast, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man did as Joseph commanded; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for slaves, and our donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke with him at the door of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And said, O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they made ready the present for Joseph’s coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed their heads, and made obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned toward his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he washed his face, and went out, and controlled himself, and said, Set on bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, who ate with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men wondered one at another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
