So Pharaoh awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, fat and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, behold, seven thin ears and parched with the east wind sprung up after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he interpreted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came before Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard it said of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the lean and the ill favoured cows ate up the first seven fat cows:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and parched with the east wind, sprung up after them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could make known the meaning of it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the seven thin and ill favoured cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blighted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he showeth to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following; for it shall be very grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And that food shall be for reserve for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a man as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he gathered all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was surrounding every city, he laid up in the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Joseph gathered grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he finished numbering; for it was without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the famine was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain; because the famine was severe in all lands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
