and hearken to Israel your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then thou didst defile it: he went up to my couch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be on the neck of thy enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou hast gone up: he stooped down, he crouched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come; and to him shall be the obedience of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Binding his foal to the vine, and his donkey’s colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be to Zidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Issachar is a strong donkey crouching down between two burdens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a slave at forced labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The archers have bitterly attacked him, and shot at him, and hated him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my ancestors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it which their father spoke to them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The purchase of the field and of the cave that is in it was from the children of Heth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered to his people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
