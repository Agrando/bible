And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then king David sent, and brought him from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.
