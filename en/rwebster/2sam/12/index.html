And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The rich man had very many flocks and herds:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it fed of his own food, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there came a traveller to the rich man, and he was not willing to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man that had come to him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared it for the man that had come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given to thee such and such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Why hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes, and give them to thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to thee shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and he was very sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how will he then be grieved, if we tell him that the child is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set food before him, and he ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while he was alive; but after the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
