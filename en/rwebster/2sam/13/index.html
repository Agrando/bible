And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and pretend that thou art sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down, and pretended that he was sick: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make for me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and prepare a meal for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Send out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come lie with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However he would not hearken to her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said to him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she had a garment of many colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of many colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom her brother said to her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be burdensome to thee. And he pressed him: yet he would not go, but blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Absalom pressed him, that he should let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have I not commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man rode upon his mule, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the report came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came many people by the way of the hill side behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he had finished speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the soul of king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
