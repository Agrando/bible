Yet ye say, How hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacobâ€™s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Though Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is my honour? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, How have we despised thy name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar; and ye say, How have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious to us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your person? saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on my altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For from the rising of the sun even to the setting of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit of it, even his food, is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have sneered at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this from your hand? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is terrible among the heathen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
