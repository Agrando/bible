my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The sorrows of death surrounded me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The sorrows of hell surrounded me: the snares of death seized me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and flew: yea, he flew upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion around him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them who hated me: for they were too strong for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They came upon me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He brought me forth also in a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt contend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thou wilt light my lamp: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who is God except the LORD? or who is a rock except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He maketh my feet like hindsâ€™ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath held me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I have pursued my enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they have fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They cried, but there was none to save them: even to the LORD, but he answered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The strangers shall fade away, and come trembling out of their fortresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He delivereth me from my enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore will I give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises to thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He giveth great deliverance to his king; and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
