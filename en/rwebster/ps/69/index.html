Save me, O God; for the waters are come in to my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: my eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that would destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my motherâ€™s children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee have fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not the water flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn to me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw near to my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: my adversaries are all before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They gave me also gall for my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Add iniquity to their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bull that hath horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell in it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
