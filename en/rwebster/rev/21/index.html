And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and immoral persons, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Having the glory of God: and her light was like a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and its height are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he measured its wall, an hundred and forty four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the building of its wall was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God lightened it, and the Lamb is its lamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the nations of them who are saved shall walk in its light: and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And its gates shall not be shut by day: for there shall be no night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there shall by no means enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
