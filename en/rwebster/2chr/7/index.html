and the glory of the LORD filled the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’S house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priests stood at their posts: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath to the river of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And on the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
