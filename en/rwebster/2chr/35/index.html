And so did they with the oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there was no passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house with which I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he may not destroy thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away; for I am grievously wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women have spoken of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
