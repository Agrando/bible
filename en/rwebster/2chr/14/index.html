In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he built fortified cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Asa had an army of men that bore shields and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came out against them Zerah the Cushite with an host of a million, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the LORD smote the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar: and the Cushites were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they smote all the cities about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they smote all the cities; for there was very much spoil in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
