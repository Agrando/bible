But Mordecai bowed not, nor did pay him honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, Why dost thou transgress the king’s commandment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did pay him honour, then was Haman full of wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are different from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow them to remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If it shall please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king’s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people of every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder them for spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was proclaimed to all people, that they should be ready for that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The posts departed, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace.
