But if we had been sold for male and female slaves, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not compensate for the king’s loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dared presume in his heart to do so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
