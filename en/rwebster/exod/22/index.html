he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If a thief shall be found breaking through, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If the sun shall have risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If the theft shall be certainly found in his hand alive, whether an ox, or donkey, or sheep; he shall restore double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If fire shall break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field, shall be consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man shall deliver to his neighbour money or goods to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief shall be found, let him pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the thief shall not be found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, to see whether he hath put his hand to his neighbour’s goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and he whom the judges shall condemn, shall pay double to his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If a man shall deliver to his neighbour a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it shall die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand to his neighbour’s goods; and the owner of it shall accept of it, and he shall not make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if it shall be stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If it shall be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man shall borrow any thing from his neighbour, and it shall be hurt, or die, the owner of it being not with it, he shall surely make it good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the owner of it shall be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man shall entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If her father shall utterly refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shalt not allow a witch to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that sacrificeth to any god, except to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou shalt afflict them in any way, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And my wrath shall burn, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If thou shalt lend money to any of my people that is poor among you, thou shalt not be to him as a money–lender, neither shalt thou charge him interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If thou shalt at all take thy neighbour’s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it to him by the setting of the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For that is his only covering, it is his raiment for his skin: what shall he sleep in? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth to me, that I will hear;

on the eighth day thou shalt give it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye shall be holy men to me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
