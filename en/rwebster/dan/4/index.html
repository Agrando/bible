The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation of it, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thy enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit of it abundant, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of heaven had their habitation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times shall pass over him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And though they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure to thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom hath departed from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What doest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and brightness returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
