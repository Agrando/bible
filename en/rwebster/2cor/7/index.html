In all things ye have proved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: and exceedingly the more we rejoiced for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I have boasted any thing to him concerning you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found to be true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
