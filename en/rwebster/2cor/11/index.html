God knoweth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them who desire occasion; that in what they glory, they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also are transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That which I speak, I speak it not according to the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For ye bear with fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye bear with it, if a man bringeth you into bondage, if a man devoureth you, if a man taketh from you, if a man exalteth himself, if a man smiteth you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. But in whatever respect any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is led into sin, and I am not incensed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
