I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such one caught up to the third heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>How he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or what he heareth from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this thing I besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing am I behind the very greatest apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is it in which ye were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I urged Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And lest, when I come again, my God may humble me among you, and I shall bewail many who have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and immorality and licentiousness which they have committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
