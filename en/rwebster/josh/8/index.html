See, I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their ones lying in ambush on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue them: and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when Israel had finished slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Joshua drew not his hand back, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones, that remaineth to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up any iron: and they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them opposite mount Gerizim, and half of them opposite mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
