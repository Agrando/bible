that they defile not their camps, in the midst of which I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the children of Israel did so, and put them out outside the camp: as the LORD spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person shall be guilty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal of it, and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him against whom he hath trespassed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if the man shall have no kinsman to recompense the trespass to, let the trespass be recompensed to the LORD, even to the priest; besides the ram of the atonement, by which an atonement shall be made for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatever any man giveth to the priest, it shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man’s wife shall go astray, and commit a trespass against him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a man shall lie with her carnally, and it shall be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept secret, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense on it; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou art defiled, and some man hath lain with thee besides thy husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to perish, and thy belly to swell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to perish: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial of it, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she is defiled, and hath done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall perish: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth astray to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he is jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
