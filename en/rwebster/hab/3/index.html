Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thy anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thy horses and thy chariots of salvation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thy arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thy anointed; thou didst wound the head out of the house of the wicked, by laying bare the foundation to the neck. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou didst strike through with his staffs the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, through the mire of great waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up to the people, he will invade them with his troops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no food; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hindsâ€™ feet, and he will make me to walk upon my high places.
