Doth God take care for oxen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or saith he this altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others are partakers of this right over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this right; but endure all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do ye not know that they who minister about holy things live from the things of the temple? and they who wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of: for necessity is laid upon me; and, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my right in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For though I am free from all men, yet I have made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this I do for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I may be a partaker of it with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know ye not that they who run in a race all run, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I fight, not as one that beateth the air:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
