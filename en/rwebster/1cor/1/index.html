was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ hath not sent me to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us who are saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For when in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumblingblock, and to the Greeks foolishness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For ye see your calling, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who from God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
