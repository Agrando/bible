And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and dragging off men and women committed them to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore they that were scattered went every where preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he was performing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed and many sick with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But there was a certain man, called Simon, who before in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, saying that he was some great person:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And to him they had regard, because that for a long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and was amazed, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(For as yet he had fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostlesâ€™ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he besought Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so he opened not his mouth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
