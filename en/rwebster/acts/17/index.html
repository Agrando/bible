And some said, What will this babbler say? some others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took him, and brought him to Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are very religious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God that made the world and all things in it, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might grope after him, and find him, though he is not far from every one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like gold, or silver, or stone, formed by art and man’s device.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he hath appointed a day, when he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; of which he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul departed from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But certain men joined themselves to him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
