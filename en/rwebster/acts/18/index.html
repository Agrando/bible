And Gallio cared for none of those things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and took his leave of the brethren, and sailed from there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he had come, helped them much who had believed through grace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
