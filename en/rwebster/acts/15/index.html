as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That the rest of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them, who from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from immorality, and from things strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men that have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That ye abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from immorality: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after they had tarried there a time, they were sent away in peace from the brethren to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>However it pleased Silas to abide there still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And some days after Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
