who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick with a fever and a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So when this was done, others also, who had diseases in the isle, came, and were healed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they supplied us with such things as were necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And from there we sailed around, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from there, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called together the chief of the Jews: and when they were assembled, he said to them, Men, brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not that I had any thing to accuse my nation of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, neither have any of the brethren that came shown or spoken any harm of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we desire to hear from thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit by Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the heart of this people has become dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great dispute among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
