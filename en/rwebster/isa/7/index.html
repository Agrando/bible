And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let us go up against Judah, and trouble it, and let us conquer it for ourselves and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ask thee a sign from the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken by both her kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>With arrows and with bows shall men come there; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And on all hills that shall be dug with the mattock, there shall not come there the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
