They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet I will not forget thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lift up thy eyes all around, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too small by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The children who thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thy ears, The place is too small for me: give place to me that I may dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then shalt thou say in thy heart, Who hath begotten these for me, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and moving to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where have they been?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
