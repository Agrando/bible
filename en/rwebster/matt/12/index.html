And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it shall fall into a pit on the sabbath, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much then is a man better than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then saith he to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched it out; and it was restored as whole, as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And charged them that they should not make him known:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall show justice to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall not quarrel, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he shall send forth justice to victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or else how can one enter into a strong manâ€™s house, and seize his goods, except he shall first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I say to you, That for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account for it in the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and he findeth none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he saith, I will return into my house from which I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also to this wicked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he was yet speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood outside, desiring to speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then one said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand outside, desiring to speak with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
