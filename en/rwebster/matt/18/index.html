if a man hath an hundred sheep, and one of them is gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go to the mountains, and seek that which is gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if so be that he findeth it, verily I say to you, he rejoiceth more over that sheep, than over the ninety and nine which went not astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he shall neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen and a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Verily I say to you, Whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus saith to him, I say not to thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, who would take account of his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him, who owed him ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as he had nothing with which to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, who owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord, having called him, said to him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou didst beg me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shouldest thou not also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the torturers, till he should pay all that was due to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
