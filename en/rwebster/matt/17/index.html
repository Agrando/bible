Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and greatly distressed: for often he falleth into the fire, and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked the demon; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came the disciples to Jesus privately, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Move from here to yonder place; and it shall move; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>However this kind goeth not out except by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceedingly sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He saith, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? from their own children, or from strangers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter saith to him, From strangers. Jesus saith to him, Then are the children free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: take that, and give to them for me and thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
