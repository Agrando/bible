And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but few are chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he saith to them, Whose is this image and superscription?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They say to him, Caesar’s. Then saith he to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first, when he had married a wife, died, and, having no issue, left his wife to his brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the second also, and the third, to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But as concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then one of them, who was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and great commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The Son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He saith to them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no man was able to answer him a word, neither dared any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
