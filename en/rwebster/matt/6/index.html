Verily I say to you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>That thy alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Verily I say to you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, be ye not like them: for your Father knoweth what things ye need, before ye ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us this day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Verily I say to you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That thou mayest not appear to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye is clear, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if thy eye is bad, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness, how great is that darkness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why are ye anxious for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And yet I say to you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, if God so clotheth the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore be not anxious for to morrow: for to morrow will be anxious for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is its own evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
