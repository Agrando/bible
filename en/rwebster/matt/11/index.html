A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kingsâ€™ houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what went ye out to see? A prophet? yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he, concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily I say to you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: however he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if ye will receive it, this is Elijah, who was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, and calling to their companions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they repented not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which had been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say to you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things are delivered to me by my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son will reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest to your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
