And Jesus saith to them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Verily I say to you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all things, whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of John, where was it from? from heaven, or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we shall say, From men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say to you, That the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, who planted a vineyard, and hedged around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to vinedressers, and went into a far country:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the vinedressers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those vinedressers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other vinedressers, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus saith to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lordâ€™s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
