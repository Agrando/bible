Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth bad fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out demons? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore whoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was its fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
