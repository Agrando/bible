And Samuel prayed to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now therefore hearken to their voice: yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to till his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will take your male servants, and your female servants, and your most choice young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen for yourselves; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he reported them in the ears of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go ye every man to his city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
