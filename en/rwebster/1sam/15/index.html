So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is east of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I repent that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and hast gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thy own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said to Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it tore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said to him, The LORD hath torn the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then said Samuel, Bring ye here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
