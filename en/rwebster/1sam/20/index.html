And they went out both of them into the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not to thee, and show it thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it shall please my father to do thee evil, then I will show it to thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I may not die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But also thou shalt not withdraw thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as to the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon had come, the king sat down to eat food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the next day, which was the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why cometh not the son of Jesse to eat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not to the king’s table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thy own shame, and to the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what hath he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, but David more so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
