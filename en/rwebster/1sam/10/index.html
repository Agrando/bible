Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went ye? And he said, To seek the donkeys: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he told him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And said to the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said to him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come there. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they ran and brought him from there: and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the worthless men said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
