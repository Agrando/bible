Then David arose, and secretly cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD’S anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David restrained his servants with these words, and permitted them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose out of the cave, and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David also rose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Saul, Why hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy harm?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, this day thy eyes have seen how the LORD hath delivered thee to day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but my eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD’S anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but my hand shall not be upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but my hand shall not be upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me with good, though I have rewarded thee with evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And thou hast showed this day how thou hast dealt with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thy hand, thou didst not kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For if a man findeth his enemy, will he let him go away well? therefore the LORD reward thee with good for what thou hast done to me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the strong hold.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
