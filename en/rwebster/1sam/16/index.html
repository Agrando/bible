And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint to me him whom I name to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said, Peaceably: I have come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when they had come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’S anointed is before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him: for we will not sit down till he hath come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and also of a beautiful countenance, and a good appearance. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day onward. So Samuel arose, and went to Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul’s servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let our lord now command thy servants, who are before thee, to seek a man, who is a skilful player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a handsome person, and the LORD is with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who is with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
