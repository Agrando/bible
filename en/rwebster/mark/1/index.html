I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region surrounding Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the mother of Simon’s wife lay sick with a fever, and immediately they tell him of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many that were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and permitted not the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when they had found him, they said to him, All men seek for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for this purpose have I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith to him, I will; be thou clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he strictly charged him, and immediately sent him away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And saith to him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out, and began to proclaim it freely, and to blaze abroad the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
