This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with toil and vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a grievous labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him to rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if one prevaileth against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no longer be admonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For out of prison he cometh to reign; though also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I considered all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.
