remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And his mother’s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and light persons, who followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, upon one stone: however Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The trees went forth once to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign thou over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the fig tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said the trees to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you from the hand of Midian:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And ye have risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That the cruelty done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thy army, and come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore rise up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun hath risen, thou shalt rise early, and rush upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Abimelech rose, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Gaal spoke again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then said Zebul to him, Where is now thy mouth, with which thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? are not these the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it came to pass on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people had come out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were in it, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into a strong hold of the house of the god Berith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And it was told to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the strong hold, and set the strong hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But there was a strong tower within the city, and to there fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it after them, and went up to the top of the tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then he called hastily to the young man his armourbearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
