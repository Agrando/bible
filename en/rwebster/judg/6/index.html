And he said, I will tarry until thou comest again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed from his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said to him, Peace be to thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take thy father’s young bull, even the second bull of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And build an altar to the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bull, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered upon the altar that was built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death by morning: if he is a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was called after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was called after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the floor; and if the dew shall be on the fleece only, and it shall be dry upon all the earth besides, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it was so: for he rose early on the next morning, and pressed the fleece, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gideon said to God, Let not thy anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make a test, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
