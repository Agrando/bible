So Simeon went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Adonibezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I have done, so God hath repaid me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she got off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, What wilt thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.
