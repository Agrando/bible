And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Heber the Kenite, who was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Deborah said to Barak, Arise; for this is the day when the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand: hath not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD destroyed Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera came down from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Barak pursued the chariots, and the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
