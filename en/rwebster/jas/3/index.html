If any man stumble not in word, the same is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, we put bits in the horsesâ€™ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the ships, which though they are so great, and are driven by fierce winds, yet they are turned about with a very small helm, wherever the pilot willeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire from hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of creatures in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless God, even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made after the similitude of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? or a vine, figs? so no fountain can yield both salt water and fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show by a good behaviour his works with meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by them that make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
