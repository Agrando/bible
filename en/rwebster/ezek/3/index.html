Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said to me, Son of man, depart, go to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee; for they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And depart, go to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I heard also the noise of the wings of the living beings that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and the noise of a great rushing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there overwhelmed among them seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet if thou shalt warn the wicked, and he will not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless if thou shalt warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put cords upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
