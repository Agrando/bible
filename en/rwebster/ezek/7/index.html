An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send my anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thy abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And my eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The morning is come upon thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the joyful shouting upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish my anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thy abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thy abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence hath risen into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all their multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is concerning their whole multitude, who shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all their multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their stomachs: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things in it: therefore have I set it far from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
