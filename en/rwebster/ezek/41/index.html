and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length of it, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then he went inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So he measured the length of it, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This is the most holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Afterward he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round the house on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers all around, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward on all sides of the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so went up from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I saw also the height of the house all around: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And between the chambers was the width of twenty cubits all around the house on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, an hundred cubits long;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he measured the length of the building in front of the separate place which was behind it, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries on every side on their three stories, opposite the door, panelled with wood all around, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To that above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around within and without, by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The altar of wood was three cubits high, and its length was two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
