And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no food?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it pleaseth thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat food, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And set two men, worthless men, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came in two men, worthless men, and sat before him: and the worthless men witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
