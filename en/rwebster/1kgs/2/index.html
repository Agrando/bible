And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to thee. And she said, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: but the kingdom is turned about, and hath become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say to thee no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, deny me not. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not deny thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Depart to Anathoth, to thy own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing of it, that is, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the army: and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there to any place whatever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For it shall be, that on the day thou shalt go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest any where abroad, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word that I have heard is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is aware of, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thy own head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
