or if the latter husband shall die, who took her to be his wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man hath newly taken a wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone for a pledge: for he taketh a man’s life for a pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man shall be found stealing from any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and shall make merchandise of him, or sell him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt remove evil from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what the LORD thy God did to Miriam by the way, after that ye had come forth from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thou shalt stand outside, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge outside to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if the man is poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In any case thou shalt deliver to him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness to thee before the LORD thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he is of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he should cry against thee to the LORD, and it be sin to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow’s raiment for a pledge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee from there: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When thou cuttest down thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When thou beatest thy olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
