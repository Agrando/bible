And Elisha said As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided to the one side and to the other, so that they two went over on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou shalt see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted to the one side and to the other: and Elisha went over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of the prophets who were looking on at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the ground barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth youths out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two youths of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
