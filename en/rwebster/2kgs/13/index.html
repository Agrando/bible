And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king’s hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD’S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou hast consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote three times, and stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the man of God was angry with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: though now thou shalt smite Syria but three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did he cast them from his presence as yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash smote him, and recovered the cities of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
