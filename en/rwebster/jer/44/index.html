Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, O, do not this abominable thing that I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore my fury and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Why do ye commit this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In that ye provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where ye are gone to dwell, that ye may cut yourselves off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an horror, and a curse, and a reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, where they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for the word that thou hast spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we will certainly do whatever thing proceedeth from our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then we had plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people who had given him that answer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an horror, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil hath happened to you, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there shall be an end of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this shall be a sign to you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
