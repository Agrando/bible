hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir to them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird yourselves with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that are about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And afterward I will bring again the captives of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? hath counsel perished from the prudent? hath their wisdom vanished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will punish him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunk; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent to the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from there, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and its neighbour cities, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise of it was heard in the Red sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Damascus hath become feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the men of the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Fear is on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Flee, go far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Arise, go up to the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides of it, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there the king and the princes, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captives of Elam, saith the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
