Make for thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And command them to say to their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to your masters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed right to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the very time of his land shall come: and then many nations and great kings shall bring him into subjection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore hearken not to the words of the prophets that speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hearken not to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: why should this city be laid waste?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that remain in this city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
