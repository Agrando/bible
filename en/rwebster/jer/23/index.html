who hath marked his word, and heard it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he shall have executed, and till he shall have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is not my word like a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their reckless boasting; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every manâ€™s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave to you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
