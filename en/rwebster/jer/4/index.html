Woe to us! for we are laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a voice declareth from Dan, and proclaimeth affliction from mount Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make ye mention to the nations; behold, proclaim against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As keepers of a field, they are against her on all sides; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thy way and thy doings have procured these things to thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth to thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My heart, my heart! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents ruined, and my curtains in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For my people are foolish, they have not known me; they are silly children, and they have no understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the fowls of the heavens had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when thou art laid waste, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlarge thy eyes with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
