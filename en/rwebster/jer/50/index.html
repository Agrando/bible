proclaim, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For out of the north there cometh a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell in it: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces toward it, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth from the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, lo, I will raise and cause to come against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of my heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Your mother shall be greatly confounded; she that bore you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shout against her on every side: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Slay all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The voice of them that flee and escape from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, encamp against it on every side; let none of them escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do to her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will punish thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A sword is upon the liars; and they shall become fools: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mixed people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasuries; and they shall be robbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad over their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the isles shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell in it: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and its neighbour cities, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not show mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands became feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
