Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not proper;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being filled with all unrighteousness, immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Backbiters, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
