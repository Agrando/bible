And, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou show contempt for thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean by itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if thy brother is grieved with thy food, now walkest thou not in love. Destroy not him with thy food, for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things which one may edify another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the sake of food destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing by which thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in what he approveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he that doubteth is condemned if he eateth, because he eateth not from faith: for whatever is not from faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
