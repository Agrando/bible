But Jonah had gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, it may be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said every one to another, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said they to him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thy occupation? and from where comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said they to him, What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea raged, and was tempestuous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to them, Take me, and cast me into the sea; so shall the sea be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea raged, and was tempestuous against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore they cried to the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this manâ€™s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took Jonah, and cast him into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the LORD, and made vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
