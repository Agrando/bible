And I took to me two staffs; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I said to them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter: a magnificent price that I was valued at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I cut asunder my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said to me, Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who shall not visit those that are cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Woe to the idle shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be wholly dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
