He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbours therefore, and they who before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some sayd, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he sayd, I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore they said to him, How were thy eyes opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought to the Pharisees him that before was blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thy eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These words his parents spoke, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man confessed that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then again they called the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, though I was blind, now I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they said to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thy eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: Why would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Mosesâ€™ disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this man, we know not where he is from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered and said to them, Why here is a marvellous thing, that ye know not where he is from, and yet he hath opened my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man is a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Since the world began hath it not been heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said to him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they who see not may see; and that they who see may be made blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
