Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they who were sent were of the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe latchet I am not worthy to loose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day John seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and he abode upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, the same said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I saw, and bore witness that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peterâ€™s brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael saith to him, How knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he saith to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, After this ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
