She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when she had thus said, she turned herself around, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him away, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus saith to her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father hath sent me, even so I send you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whose sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; and whose sins ye retain, they are retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach here thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach here thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus saith to him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life through his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
