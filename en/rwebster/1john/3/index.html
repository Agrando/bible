For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil: whoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By this we perceive the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his compassions from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if our heart condemneth us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our heart doth not condemn us, then have we confidence toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit who he hath given to us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
