and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he shall be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou shalt seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou shalt forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses of it, and of its treasuries, and of its upper chambers, and of its inner parlours and of the place of the mercy seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the surrounding chambers, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Even the weight for the lampstands of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every lampstand, and for its lamps: and for the lampstands of silver by weight, both for the lampstand, and also for its lamps, according to the use of every lampstand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And by weight he gave gold for the tables of showbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins he gave gold by weight for every basin; and likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee;
