And he arose and stood forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And looking around upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored well as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they were filled with rage; and conferred one with another what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out to a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they that were tormented with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went power out of him, and healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe to you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe to you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bless them that curse you, and pray for them who despitefully use you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if ye love them who love you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if ye do good to them who do good to you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also do even the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if ye lend to them from whom ye hope to receive, what thanks have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much in return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure it shall be measured to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one that is perfect shall be as his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thy eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thy own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For every tree is known by its own fruit. For from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble bush do they gather grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for from the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Whoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man who built an house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house on the earth; against which the stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
