And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have a donkey or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they could not answer him again to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he put forth a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose out the best places; saying to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When thou art invited by any man to a wedding, sit not down in the best place; lest a more honourable man than thou be invited by him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he that invited thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when thou art invited, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour in the presence of them that sit eating with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For whoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he also to him that invited him, When thou givest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when thou givest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when one of them that sat eating with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then said he to him, A certain man gave a great supper, and invited many:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were invited, Come; for all things are now ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them out: I pray thee have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the maimed, and the lame, and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I say to you, That none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man cometh to me, and hateth not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he hath sufficient to finish it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lest perhaps, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth a delegation, and desireth conditions of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So likewise, whoever he is of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Salt is good: but if the salt hath lost its savour, how shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
