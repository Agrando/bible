And he divided to them his living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he was longing to fill his belly with the husks that the swine ate: and no man gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And bring here the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore his father came out, and entreated him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither have I at any time transgressed thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as soon as this thy son had come, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It was right that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
