And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I also am a man placed under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned himself about, and said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well that had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city were with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Weep not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bore him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet hath risen among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John reported to him of all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And John calling two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and afflictions, and of evil spirits; and to many that were blind he gave sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Jesus answering said to them, Go, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And blessed is he, who shall not be offended because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is he, concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I say to you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And all the people that heard him, and the tax collectors, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But wisdom is justified by all her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, say it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore I say to thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they that were eating with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
