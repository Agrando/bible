And he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Strive to enter in at the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When once the master of the house hath risen up, and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not where ye are from:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then ye shall begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not where ye are from; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Go away, and depart from here: for Herod will kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and verily I say to you, Ye shall not see me, until the time shall come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
