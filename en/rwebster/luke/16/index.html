And he said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take thy bill, and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends by the riches of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous riches, who will commit to your trust the true riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they mocked him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than one tittle of the law to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime didst receive thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they who would pass from here to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I have five brethren; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
