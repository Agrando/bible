I gathered my myrrh with my spice. I ate my honeycomb with my honey and drank my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Shulamite »I sleep, but my heart is awake. It is the voice of my beloved that knocks, saying: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I have removed my coat. How shall I put it on? I have washed my feet. How shall I defile them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»My beloved extended his hand through the latch opening of the door. My heart yearned for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I rose up to open to my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh. My fingers were sweet from sweet smelling myrrh and they grasped the lock handles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. My heart jumped when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him. I called him, but he did not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The watchmen that went about the city found me, they struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took my veil from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him, that I am lovesick.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Daughters of Jerusalem »Is your beloved more than another beloved, O you fairest among women? Is your beloved more than another beloved that you so charge us?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Shulamite »My beloved is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»His head is as the finest gold. His locks are like date clusters, bushy and black as a raven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers. His lips are like lilies, dripping sweet smelling myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»His hands are as gold rings set with beryl. His belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»His legs are like pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold. His countenance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»His mouth is very sweet: yes, he is altogether handsome. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
