Remember those who are suffering, as though you were suffering as they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled: for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You should be free from the love of money. Be content with what you have, for he has said: »I will not leave you. I will not forsake you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So that with good confidence courage we say: »Jehovah is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do to me?« (Psalm 56:11)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember those who are taking the lead among you, men that spoke the Word of God to you. Consider their behavior and imitate their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not be carried away by varied different and strange teachings. It is good that the heart is established by grace and not by food. Those who are occupied by them are not benefited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy Place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus suffered outside the gate that he might sanctify the people through his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us therefore go forth to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We do not have a city that continues. We seek after the city that is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God through him Jesus, that is, the fruit of lips that make confession give thanks and offer praise to his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not forget neglect to do good and to communicate fellowshipshare, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Obey those who lead you. Submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your lives and must account for this. Obey them that their work may be a joy and not a burden; that would be without gain for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience. And we wish to live honorably in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, even our Lord Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>make you perfect mature in every good thing. May you do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I urge you, brothers, bear with the word of exhortation. I have written to you in few words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do you know that brother Timothy has been released? If he comes shortly, I will see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Greet all those who rule over you, and all the holy ones. They in Italy greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Grace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
