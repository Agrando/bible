Let us not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>We should not repeat the basic teachings about baptisms, and of the laying on of hands setting apart for holy tasks, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We will do this if God permits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and have tasted the good Word of God, and the powers of the age to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>if they shall fall away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance. This is because they personally impale the Son of God again, and expose him to public shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The earth that drinks in the rain that comes upon it, and brings forth vegetation for those by whom it was cultivated, receives blessing from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That which bears thorns and briars is rejected, and is near to being cursed. It ends up being burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Even though we speak this way, beloved, we are convinced that you will have better things, things that belong to salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For God is not unrighteous unjust to forget your work and the love you showed for his name. You ministered to the holy ones and continue to minister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope down to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We desire that you are not lazy, but follow those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When God made a promise to Abraham, he could swear by no one greater then himself, so he swore by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said: »I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After waiting patiently, Abraham received the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men swear by someone greater then themselves: and an oath for confirmation to them puts an end to the problem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he confirmed it with an oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>God did this to offer encouragement so we may rely on the hope offered to us. We have taken refuge in that hope and it is impossible for God to lie. These two things can never be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of life. It is a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That is where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
