They also had it. But the word that was heard did not benefit them because they were not united in faith by what was heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We who believe enter into the rest. As God said: »I swore in my anger: They shall not enter into my rest.« Yet Gods works were completed from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Somewhere God said this about the seventh day: »God rested on the seventh day from all his works.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again: »They shall not enter into my rest.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It remains for some to enter into it. Those who first received the good news did not enter in because they did not obey and lacked faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He determines a certain day by saying through David: »Today,« after so long a time; just as it was said before, »Today, if you will listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts.« (Psalm 95:7)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If Joshua had given them rest, he God would not have spoken afterwards about another day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There remains then a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who enters into his rest also rests from his own works, just as God did from his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let us do our utmost to enter into that rest. Let no one fall into the same pattern of disobedience by not obeying the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Word of God is alive and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. (Ephesians 6:17) It separates the physical person from the spiritual person, of both joints and marrow. And it can discern judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. (John 12:48)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. All things are uncovered and laid bare before him. We must account to him. (Romans 2:16; Romans 14:12)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, so let us hold fast our confession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our infirmities weaknesses. He was tested in all things like ourselves. Yet he was without sin!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let us approach the throne of grace loving-kindness with confidence, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for help in time of need.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
