It was first presented by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>God also testified about it with signs, wonders, and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit given according to his will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He did not subject the world to come that we speak about to the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But a certain witness has given proof, saying: »What is man, that you are mindful of him? Or what is the son of man that you take care of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You made him a little lower than the angels for a little while. Greek: brachus, short time (Psalm 8:4, 5) You crowned him with glory and honor, and set him over the works of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You put all things in subjection under his feet.« You subjected all things to him and left nothing that is not subject to him. Now we do not see yet all things in subjection to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honor for suffering death. By the grace of God he tasted death for every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It was appropriate that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, should bring many sons to glory, to make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through suffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Both he who sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all from one. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them »brothers«.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He says: »I will declare your name to my brothers; in the middle of the congregation I will sing praises to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again: »I will put my trust in him.« And again: »Behold, the children that Jehovah has given me.« (Isaiah 8:18)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since the »children« are partakers of flesh and blood, he also took part of the same things, that through death he might destroy him that had the power to cause death, Satan the Devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He does not help the angels, but he helps the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This means that he had to become like his »brothers« in every way, in order to be their faithful and merciful High Priest in his service to God, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice pay atonementto make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since he has suffered and was tested in every way; he is able to help those who are being tested.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
