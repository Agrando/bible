The first room was called »the Holy Place.« It contained the lamp stand and table and the consecrated bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Beyond the second curtain was a room called »the Most Holy Place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It had a golden incense burner. The Ark of the Covenant was completely covered with gold. It contained the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat were above the Ark. Now is not the time to speak in detail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When these things are prepared, the priests enter the outer room often to carry on their services.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Only the high priest enters the inner room. Once a year he entered with blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Holy Spirit revealed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the tent was still in use.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This is a symbol that points to the present time. It means that the offerings and animal sacrifices presented to God cannot make the worshipers heart perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>since they have to do only with food, drink, and various purification ceremonies. These are all outward rules, which apply only until the time comes to change them for something better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here. He also went into a much better tent that is not made by humans and does not belong to this creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He went once and forever into the Most Holy Place having eternal salvation. It is not with the blood of goats and young bulls, but with his blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes from the burning of a young cow, sprinkled on the unclean made them outwardly clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The blood of Christ did even more. Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself without blemish to God and cleansed your conscience from dead works. Now we can serve worship the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant. A death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant. Those called may receive the promise of everlasting inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A will is used for a person who is dead. It becomes effective only when the person dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A will is in force after a person dies. Otherwise it is not in effect at all while the one who provided it lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The first covenant was dedicated with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said: »This is the blood of the covenant that God has presented to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Almost all things are by the Law purified with blood. There is no forgiveness unless blood is poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It was necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these. But the heavenly things should be cleansed with better sacrifices than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Christ has not entered into the Holy Place made with human hands. This is a copy of the true one. He has entered into heaven to appear before the presence of God for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neither should he offer himself as the high priest enters into the Holy Place every year with blood of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Otherwise he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. He has presented himself once at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. He will appear the second time without sin to those who look to him for their salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
