He may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He is able to exercise compassion towards the ignorant and those going astray, since he is also subject to weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That is why he must offer sacrifices, for his own and for the peoples sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>No one takes this honor upon himself. He is called by God, even as Aaron was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also Christ did not glorify himself to be made a high priest. It was God who said to him: »You are my Son; I today have become your father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As he said in another place:« You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the days of his life on earth, when he Christ offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to the one who was able to save him out of death, and was heard because of his godly reverence.

But you need someone to teach you again from the beginning the elementary truths from the Word of God.
