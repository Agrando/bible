It is not the actual things. The continual yearly sacrifices can never make those who worship perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If it could, it would cease to be offered. Once the worshipers were cleansed they would have no awareness of sin anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>These sacrifices are an annual reminder of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Christ came into the world he said: »Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but you have prepared a body for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You have no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Then I said: I have come in the scroll of the book. It is written about me, to do your will, O God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said: »You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin;« which are offered by the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He also said: »I come to do your will, O God.« He takes away the first in order to establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are sanctified by his »will« through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Every priest stands daily, serving and offering time after time the same sacrifices. Yet they can never take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>waiting until his enemies are placed as a stool for his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With one offering he has perfected those who are sanctified forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after that he said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says Jehovah; I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them. (Jeremiah 31:33)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I will not remember their sins and unrighteousness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Where there is forgiveness for these, there is no more offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by a new and living way, which he consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>having a high priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let us consider one another to encourage love and good works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and even more, as you see the day approaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If we continue to practicedeliberately persist in sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But there remains a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fiery indignation, which will devour Gods enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He that despised Moses Law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>What about those who despise the Son of God? Those who treat as a cheap thing the blood of Gods covenant that purified them from sin? Those who insult the Spirit of grace? Think how much worse the punishment they deserve will be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We know who said: »Vengeance is mine; I will repay« ; and who also said, »Jehovah will judge his people.« (Deuteronomy 32:35)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a dreadful terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember the former days in which, after being enlightened, you endured great struggle with afflictions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You were at times publicly insulted and mistreated. Other times you were ready to join those who were being treated in this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shared the sufferings of prisoners. When all your belongings were seized, you endured your loss gladly. This is because you knew that you possessed something much better, which would last forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do not lose your courage confidenceboldness. It brings a great reward with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You need to persevere in order to do the will of God and receive what he promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»In just a little while, he who is coming will come. He will not delay!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»My righteous people will live by faith. If any of them turn back, I will not be pleased with them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>We are not people who turn back and are destroyed. Instead, we have faith and are saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
