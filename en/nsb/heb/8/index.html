He sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He is a minister of the Holy Place and of the true Tabernacle, built by Jehovah and not man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. It is necessary to have something to offer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The work they do as priests is only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. It is the same as it was with Moses. When he was about to build the sacred tent, God told him: »Be sure to make everything according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry. The covenant that he arranged between God and his people is a better one, because it is based on promises of better things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If there had been nothing wrong with the first covenant, there would not have been a need for a second one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>God finds fault with his people and said to them: »The time is coming, says Jehovah, when I will draw up a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah. (Jeremiah 31:31)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. They were not faithful to the covenant I made with them, and so I paid no attention to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said Jehovah: I will put my teachings laws in their mind, I will write them upon their hearts deep thoughtunderstanding. I will be their God, and they will be my people. (Jeremiah 31:32)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»They will not teach a neighbor or brother saying: »Know Jehovah.« All will know me from the little one among them to the great among them. (Hosea 2:20)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I will forgive their wickedness and I will remember their sins no more.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By calling this covenant »new,« he has made the first one old obsolete. That which grows old and aged will soon disappear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
