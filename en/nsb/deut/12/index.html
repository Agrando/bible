Burn their Asherah poles with fire. Cut down the carved images of their gods and obliterate their name from that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Do not worship Jehovah your God with such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»You should seek Jehovah at the place Jehovah your God chooses out of all your tribes.

You will say: I am hungry for meat. Then eat as much meat as you want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»If the place Jehovah your God chooses to put his name is too far away from you, you may slaughter an animal from the herds or flocks that Jehovah has given you. Eat as much as you want in your city. I have commanded you to do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Eat it as you would eat a gazelle or a deer.

Do not add to it nor take away from it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
