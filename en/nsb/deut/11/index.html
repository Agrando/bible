They have not seen his greatness and his awesome power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»They have not seen his signs and the work he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»And what He did to Egypt's army, to its horses and its chariots, when He made the water of the Red Sea engulf them while they pursued. Jehovah completely destroyed them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They do not know what Jehovah did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them in all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You have seen with your own eyes all the great deeds Jehovah did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Obey every commandment I command you today. Then you may be strong and go in and possess the land you will cross over to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Then you may prolong your days on the land Jehovah swore to give to your fathers and their descendants. It is a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you came. You used to sow your seed and irrigate it with your foot as in a vegetable garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»But the land you go to possess is a land of hills and valleys. It drinks water from the rain from the clouds in the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Jehovah your God cares about this land. Jehovah watches over it day after day and year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»If you faithfully obey my commandments that I give you today, love Jehovah your God, and serve him with all your heart and with all your being,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will send rain on your land at the proper time, both in the fall and in the spring. You will gather your own grain, new wine, and olive oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I will provide grass in the fields for your animals. You will be able to eat and be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Guard yourselves! Your heart could be deceived. You could turn away and serve other gods and worship them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Jehovah will become angry with you. He will shut the sky and there will be no rain. Then the ground will not grow any crops. You will quickly disappear from this good land Jehovah is giving you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Take these words of mine to heart and keep them in mind. Write them down, tie them around your wrist, and wear them as headbands to remind you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Teach them to your children! Talk about them in your home and away. Speak of them when you lie down or get up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»You and your descendants will live a long time in the land that Jehovah promised your ancestors. Your families will live there as long as the sky is above the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Love Jehovah your God and obey all the laws and teachings I commanded you today. Hold fast to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Then Jehovah will drive out all these nations from before you. You will drive out nations greater and mightier than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Every place on which the sole of your foot treads will be yours. Your border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the river, the river Euphrates, as far as the western sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»No man will be able to stand before you. Jehovah your God will lay the dread of you and the fear of you on all the land where you set foot. This is as he promised you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»See I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Receive the blessing when you listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Receive the curse when you do not listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside from the way that I command you today, by following other gods you have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»When Jehovah your God brings you into the land you are about to possess, you will offer blessings on Mount Gerizim and cursing on Mount Ebal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Are they not across the Jordan toward the setting sun? Are they in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks big trees of Moreh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»You are about to cross the Jordan to go in to possess the land Jehovah your God is giving you. You must possess it and live in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Be careful to do all the statutes and judgments I present to you today.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
