That is an abomination to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»In one of the cities Jehovah your God is giving you, there may be a man or woman among you who is doing what Jehovah considers evil. This person may be disregarding the conditions of Jehovahs covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Some worship and bow down to other gods, the sun, the moon, or the whole army of heaven. I have forbidden this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»If it is told you and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire thoroughly. If it is true and the thing certain that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Bring that man or woman who has done this evil deed out to your gates. Stone the man or the woman to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»On the evidence and testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. He shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»The witnesses must throw the first stone to put him to death, and afterward all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»If any case is too difficult for you to decide, between one kind of homicide or another, between one kind of lawsuit or another, and between one kind of assault or another, being cases of dispute in your courts, then you should go to the place Jehovah your God chooses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Approach the Levitical priest or the judge who is in office in those days. Inquire of them and they will declare to you the verdict in the case.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Act according to the terms of the verdict they declare to you from that place Jehovah chooses. Be careful to abide by all that they teach you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Act according to the verdict and the terms they tell you. Do not turn away from the word they declare to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The man who acts presumptuously and does not listen to the priest or the judge will die. This way you will purge the evil from Israel. The priests and judges are there to serve Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Then all the people will hear and be afraid. They will not act presumptuously again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Enter the land Jehovah your God gives you. Possess it and live in it. You will say: I will set a king over me like all the nations who are around me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>you shall surely set a king over you whom Jehovah your God chooses. It will be one from among your countrymen. You may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He must not increase his herd of horses. He must not send the people to return to Egypt to get more horses. For Jehovah said to you: You should never again return that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He must not take many wives or his heart will turn astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»When he first sits on the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll taken in the presence of the Levitical priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»He should keep it with him. He should read from it all the days of his life. In this way he will learn to respect Jehovah his God by carefully observing all the words of this Law and these statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»He must not think he is better than the rest of his people. He will not disobey these commandments in any way. So he and his sons will rule for a long time in Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
