Do not be afraid of them for Jehovah your God, who brought you out of Egypt, will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»A priest must come and speak to the troops before the battle begins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He should say: »Listen, Israel, today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not lose your courage! Do not be afraid. Do not tremble because of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Jehovah your God is going with you. He will fight for you against your enemies and give you victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The officers should speak to the army: If you have built a new house that has not been dedicated, you may go home. Otherwise, you might die in battle, and someone else will dedicate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Have you planted a vineyard and not used its fruits? Go home to your house and vineyard. If you die in battle another man will use its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Is there anyone here engaged to be married?

You may use everything that belongs to your enemies. Jehovah has given it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»This is what you must do to all the cities that are far away that do not belong to the nations nearby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Do not spare anyone's life in the cities of these nations Jehovah your God is giving you as your property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»You must capture the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites for Jehovah and completely destroy them.

Do not harm any of its fruit trees with an ax. You may eat the fruit. Never cut those trees down, because the trees of the field are not people you have come to blockade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»You may destroy trees that you know are not fruit trees. You may cut them down and use them in your blockade until you capture the city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
