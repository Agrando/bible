When a person kills someone he may run to one of these cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»A person who unintentionally kills someone he never hated in the past may run to one of these cities to save his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»For example: when a man goes into the forest with his friend to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron head slips off the handle and strikes his friend so that he dies. He may flee to one of these cities and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in the heat of his anger. He may overtake him and because the way is long he may take his life. Even though he was not deserving of death, since he had not hated him previously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Hear my command: You must set aside three cities for yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»If Jehovah your God enlarges your territory, just as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land he promised to give your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»And if you carefully observe all this commandment I command you today, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in his ways always you shall add three more cities for yourself, besides these three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Innocent blood will not be shed in your land that Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance. Blood guiltiness will not be on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»But if there is a man who hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and murders him. If he flees to one of these cities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»the elders of his city will send for him. They will take him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Do not pity him. Purge the blood of the innocent from Israel that it may go well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Do not move your neighbor's boundary mark. The ancestors have set this in your inheritance. You will inherit this in the land Jehovah your God gives you to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»One witness is not enough to convict someone of a crime, offense, or sin he may have committed. Cases must be settled based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»This is what you must do whenever a witness takes the stand to accuse a person falsely of a crime.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The two people involved must stand in Jehovahs presence, in front of the priests and judges who are serving at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The judges must make a thorough investigation. If it is found that the witness lied when he testified against the other Israelite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>do to him what he planned to do to the other person. Get rid of this evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»When other people hear about this, they will be afraid. Never again will such an evil thing be done among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Have no pity on him: Take a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
