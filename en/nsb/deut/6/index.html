Obey them after you enter the land and take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»As long as you live, you, your son, and your grandson must respect Jehovah your God. All of you must obey his laws and commandments I give you. Then you will live a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Listen, O Israel, and be careful to obey these laws. Things will go well for you and your population will increase in a land flowing with milk and honey. This is what Jehovah the God of your ancestors promised you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Listen, Israel! JEHOVAH OUR GOD IS ONE GOD!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with your entire mind and with all your strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»These words that I command you this day must be in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Carefully teach them to your sons. Talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way. Speak about them when you lie down, and when you rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Bind them for a sign upon your hand. They shall be as frontlets between your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Write them upon the posts of your house, and on your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»It shall be like the time when Jehovah your God brought you into the land he promised to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. He would give you large and beautiful cities that you did not build.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»The houses will be full of good things that you did not put in them. There will be wells that you did not dig. There will be vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant. Jehovah will bring you into this land and you will have all you want to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Beware that you do not forget Jehovah, for he brought you out of Egypt your house of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»You must respect Jehovah your God. Serve him and swear by his name!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Do not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples around you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Jehovah your God is a totally demanding zealous God. He tolerates no rivals! The anger of Jehovah your God will burn against you. He will then destroy you from the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Do not test Jehovah your God like you tested him in Massah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Obey the commandments of Jehovah your God.

That way he could give us the land he swore to give to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes. He required that we respect Jehovah our God. This was for our own good that he might preserve us alive, as things are today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»If we are careful to do these commandments before Jehovah our God, just as he ordered us, it will mean righteousness for us.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
