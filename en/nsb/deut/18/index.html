They will eat what has been sacrificed to Jehovah. These sacrifices will be what they receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»They are to own no land, as the other tribes do. Their inheritance is the privilege of being Jehovahs priests, as Jehovah told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»When cattle or sheep are sacrificed, the priests are to be given the shoulder, the jaw, and the stomach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»They are to receive the first share of the grain, wine, olive oil, and wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Jehovah chose from all your tribes the tribe of Levi to serve him and his sons as priests forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Any Levite who wants to may come from any town in Israel to the one place of worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»He may serve there, as a priest of Jehovah his God, like the other Levites who are serving there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He is to receive the same amount of food as the other priests.
