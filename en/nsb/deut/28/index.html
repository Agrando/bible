You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Jehovah will make you the head and not the tail, and you only will be above, and you will not be underneath. If you listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I charge you today, to observe them carefully,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and do not turn aside from any of the words I command you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»If you do not obey Jehovah your God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes with which I charge you today, that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Cursed will you be in the city, and cursed will you be in the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Your basket and your kneading bowl will be cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Cursed will be the offspring of your body and the produce of your ground, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Jehovah will curse everything you do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»If you do evil and reject Jehovah, he will bring on you trouble, confusion, and rebuke in everything you do.

No one will be around to force your enemies to give them back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Your sons and daughters will be dragged off to a foreign country. And you will stand there helpless. Even if you watch for them until you go blind, you will never see them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»A foreign nation will take all the crops that you have worked so hard to grow.

Worms will eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»You will have olive trees throughout all your coasts, but you shall not anoint with the oil, for your olive shall drop off its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Even your infant sons and daughters will be taken as prisoners of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»Locusts will take over all your trees and the fruit of your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»The alien who is living among you will be lifted up higher and higher over you, while you go down lower and lower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»They will be able to make loans to you, but you won't be able to make loans to them. They will be the head, and you will be the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»All these disasters will come on you. They will be with you until you are destroyed. This is because you did not obey Jehovah your God and keep all the laws that he gave you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Everyone will look at you and your descendants and realize that Jehovah has placed you under a curse for a very long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»You did not serve Jehovah your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»You will serve your enemies whom Jehovah will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in the lack of all things. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»Jehovah will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, as the eagle swoops down, a nation whose language you will not understand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>a nation of fierce countenance who will have no respect for the old, nor show favor to the young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»They will eat the offspring of your animals and the crops from your fields until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, no new wine, no olive oil, no calves from your herds, and no lambs or kids from your flocks. They will continue to do this until you are completely desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>»They will blockade all your cities until the high, fortified walls you trust come down everywhere in your land.

They will cling to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>»Jehovah will also bring you every kind of sickness and plague not written in this Book of the Law. They will continue until you are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>»You were at one time as numerous as the stars in the sky. But only a few of you will be left. This is because you did not obey Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>»Jehovah was very glad to make you prosperous and numerous.

You will be torn out of the land you are about to enter and possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>»Jehovah will scatter you among all the people of the world. He will scatter you from one end of the earth to the other. There you will serve gods made of wood and stone that neither you nor your ancestors ever knew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>»You will find no peace among those nations. There will be no place to call your own. There Jehovah will give you an unsettled mind, failing eyesight, and despair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>»Your life will always be in danger. Day and night you will be filled with terror. You will live in constant fear of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>»Your hearts will pound with fear at everything you see. Every morning you will wish for evening. Every evening you will wish for morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>»Jehovah will send you back to Egypt in ships, even though he said that you would never have to go there again.
