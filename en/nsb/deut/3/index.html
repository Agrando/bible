King Og of Bashan and all his army came to fight us at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Jehovah said to me: Do not be afraid of him. I will hand him, all his army, and his land, over to you. Do to him what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»So Jehovah our God also handed King Og of Bashan and all his army over to us. We defeated him and left no survivors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»We captured all his cities. Not one was missed. We captured a total of sixty cities in the territory of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»All of these cities were fortified with high walls and double-door gates with bars across the gates. We also captured a large number of unwalled villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»We destroyed all the towns and put to death all the men, women, and children. This was just as we did in the towns that belonged to King Sihon of Heshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»We kept the livestock and took plunder from the towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Sihon and Og ruled Amorite kingdoms east of the Jordan River. Their land stretched from the Arnon River Gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north. We captured it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Mount Hermon is called Mount Sirion by the people of Sidon. The Amorites call it Mount Senir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, and Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan were captured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Of the Rephaim only King Og of Bashan was left. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»We took possession of this land. I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad the land north of Aroer near the Arnon Valley and half of the mountain region of Gilead with its cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»I assigned the rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, where Og had ruled, that is, the entire Argob region to half the tribe of Manasseh. Bashan was known as the land of the Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jair, from the tribe of Manasseh, took the entire region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of Geshur and Maacah. He named the villages after himself, and they are still known as the villages of Jair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I assigned Gilead to the clan of Machir of the tribe of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I assigned the territory from Gilead to the Arnon River to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The middle of the river was their southern boundary, and their northern boundary was the Jabbok River, part of which formed the Ammonite border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»On the west their territory extended to the Jordan River, from Lake Galilee in the north down to the Dead Sea in the south and to the foot of Mount Pisgah on the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Then I gave them the following instructions: Jehovah our God gave you the land east of the Jordan to occupy. Now arm your fighting men and send them across the Jordan ahead of the other tribes of Israel, to help them occupy their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Your wives, children, and livestock, for you have a lot of livestock, will remain behind in the towns I assigned to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Help the other Israelites until they occupy the land Jehovah is giving them west of the Jordan and until Jehovah lets them live there in peace, just as he has done here for you. After that, you may return to the land I assigned to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I also gave Joshua this command: You have seen with your own eyes everything Jehovah your God has done to these two kings. Jehovah will do the same to all of the kingdoms on the other side of the Jordan River where you are going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Do not be afraid of them. For Jehovah your God fights for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Then I pleaded with Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you have begun to show me how great and powerful you are. What kind of god is there in heaven or on earth that can do the deeds and the mighty acts you have done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Please let me go over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan River. Let me see those beautiful mountains in Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Jehovah was angry with me because of you, so he would not listen to me. He said: Enough of that! Do not talk to me anymore about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Go to the top of Mount Pisgah, and look west, north, south, and east. You may look at the land, but you will never cross the Jordan River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Joshua will lead Israel across the Jordan to take the land. So help him. Encourage him and strengthen him. Tell him what he must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So we stayed in the valley at Beth Peor.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
