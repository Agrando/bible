He rose like the sun over Edom and shone on his people from Mount Paran. Ten thousand angels were with him. A flaming fire was at his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Jehovah loves his people. All Your holy ones are in your hand. They followed in your steps and everyone receives your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Moses commanded us with a law these teachings, a heritage of the assembly of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He was king in Jeshurun Israel when the leaders and all the tribes of the people of Israel were gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Do not let his men be few.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people. With his hands he contended for them. May you Jehovah be help against his adversaries.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to your godly man, whom you tested at Massah and with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Who said of his father and mother: I have not seen them; and he did not acknowledge his brothers, nor did he regard his own sons. They observed your word and kept your covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»They will teach your ordinances to Jacob, and your Law to Israel. They will burn incense before you, and whole burnt offerings on your altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»O Jehovah, bless his skills and accept the work of his hands. Shatter the loins of those who rise up against him and those who hate him, so that they will not rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»May the beloved of Jehovah dwell in security by him who shields him all the day. He dwells between his shoulders.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Blessed of Jehovah is his land. Bless it with the dew from heaven above and with the deep waters lying below.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Bless with the choice yield of the sun, and with the bounty produced each month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Bless with the best things of the ancient mountains, and with the choice things of the everlasting hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Bless with the choice things of the earth and its fullness. Let the favor of him who dwelt in the bush come to the head of Joseph and to the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»As the firstborn of his bulls, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild bull. With them he will push the peoples, all at once, to the ends of the earth. They are the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Rejoice Zebulun in your going out. And rejoice Issachar in your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»They will call peoples to the mountain. There they will offer righteous sacrifices. They will draw out the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad. He lies down as a lion and tears the arm, also the crown of the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»He provided the first part for himself. There the ruler's portion was reserved. He came with the leaders of the people and executed his ordinance of Israel and the justice of Jehovah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Dan is a lion's cub. He leaps forth from Bashan.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full of the blessing of Jehovah, take possession of the sea and the south.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Asher is the most blessed with sons. May his brothers favor him. And may he dip his foot in oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Your locks will be iron and bronze. According to your days, so will your leisurely walk be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»There is none like the God of Jeshurun Israel. He rides the heavens to give you help. He goes through the skies in his majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The eternal God is a dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. He drove out the enemy from before you, and said: Destroy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Israel dwells in security. The fountain of Jacob is secluded in a land of grain and new wine. His heavens also drop down dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»You are blessed O Israel. Who is like you, a people saved by Jehovah? He is the shield of your help and the sword of your majesty! So your enemies will cringe before you and you will tread upon their high places.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
