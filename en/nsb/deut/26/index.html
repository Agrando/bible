I have entered the land Jehovah swore to our fathers to give us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»The priest will take the basket from your hand and set it down before the altar of Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Answer before Jehovah your God: My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt and traveled there. They were few in number but he became a great, mighty and populous nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»The Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us. They imposed hard labor on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»We cried out to Jehovah, the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice. He saw our affliction and our toil and our oppression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror and with signs and wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Now behold, I have brought the first of the produce of the ground that You, O Jehovah have given me. Set it down before Jehovah your God, and worship before Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»You, the Levite and the alien among you will rejoice in all the good Jehovah your God has given you and your household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Finish paying all the tithe of your increase in the third year, the year of tithing. Then you shall give it to the Levite, the stranger, and the orphan and to the widow, that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Say before Jehovah your God: I have removed the sacred portion from my house. I also have given it to the Levite and the alien, the orphan and the widow, according to all your commandments that you have commanded me. I have not transgressed or forgotten any of your commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I have not eaten of it while mourning.

You shall therefore be careful to do them with all your heart and with all your being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»You declared Jehovah to be your God today. You said you would walk in his ways and keep his statutes, his commandments and his ordinances, and listen to his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Jehovah declared you to be his people and a treasured possession. Obey his commandments and receive his promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»He will set you high above all nations that he has made, for praise, fame, and honor. You will be a consecrated people to Jehovah your God, as he has spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
