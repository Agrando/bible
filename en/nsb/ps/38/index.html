Your hand has struck me hard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>No healthy spot is left on my body because of your rage. There is no peace in my bones because of my sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My guilt has overwhelmed me. Like a heavy load, it is more than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My wounds smell rotten. They fester because of my stupidity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am bent over and bowed down very low. All day I walk around in sadness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My insides are filled with burning pain, and no healthy spot is left on my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am numb and completely devastated. I roar because my heart is filling with anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You know all my desires, O Jehovah. My groaning has not been hidden from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My heart pounds. I have lost my strength. In my blindness the light of my eyes has left me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My loved ones and my friends keep their distance and my relatives stand far away because of my sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those who seek my life lay traps for me. Those who are out to harm me talk about ruining me. All day long they think of ways to deceive me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I am like some one deaf and speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am like one who cannot hear and who can offer no arguments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I wait with hope for you, O Jehovah. You will answer, O Jehovah, my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I said: Do not let them gloat over me. When my foot slips, do not let them promote themselves at my expense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I am ready to fall. I feel pain continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I confess my guilt. My sin troubles me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My mortal enemies are growing stronger. Many hate me for no reason.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They pay me back with evil instead of good, and they accuse me because I try to do what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not abandon me, O Jehovah. O my God, do not be so distant from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Come quickly to help me, Jehovah my salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
