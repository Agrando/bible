Fight against those who fight against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Use your shields, both small and large. Arise to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Hold your spear to block the way of those who pursue me. Say to me: I am your salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let those who seek my life be put to shame and disgraced. Let those who plan my downfall be turned back in confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let them be like chaff blown by the wind as the angel of Jehovah chases them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let their path be dark and slippery as the angel of Jehovah pursues them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They hid their net in a pit for no reason. They dug the pit to trap me for no reason.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Surprise them with destruction. Let the net that they hid catch them. Let them fall into their own pit and be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will find joy in Jehovah and be joyful about his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All my bones will say: »O Jehovah, who can compare with you? You rescue the weak person from the one who is too strong for him and weak and needy people from the one who robs them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violent witnesses bring charges against me. They ask me things I know nothing about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I am devastated because they pay me back with evil instead of good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when they were sick, I wore sackcloth. I humbled myself with fasting. My prayer returned unanswered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I walked around as if I were mourning for my friend or my brother. I was bent over as if I were mourning for my mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet, when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together. They gathered together against me. Unknown attackers tore me apart without stopping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>With godless and abusive mockers, they grit their teeth at me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O Jehovah, how long will you observe? Rescue me from their attacks. Rescue my precious life from the lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will give you thanks in the large congregation. I will praise you in a mighty crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not let my treacherous enemies gloat over me. Do not let those who hate me for no reason wink maliciously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They do not talk about peace. Instead, they scheme against the peaceful people in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They open their mouths against me and say: Aha! Aha! Our own eyes have seen it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now you see it, O Jehovah. Do not remain silent. O Jehovah, do not be so far away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Wake up, and rise to my defense. Plead my case, O my God Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge me by your righteousness, O Jehovah my God. Do not let them gloat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Do not let them say: Aha, just what we wanted! We have swallowed him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let those who gloat over my downfall be thoroughly put to shame and confused. Let those who promote themselves at my expense be clothed with shame and disgrace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Let those who are happy when I am declared innocent joyfully sing and rejoice. Let them continually say: »Jehovah is great. He is happy when his servant has peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>My tongue will declare your righteousness and your praise all day long.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
