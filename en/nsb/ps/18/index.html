He is my deliverer. He is my God and my crag, the one in whom I take refuge. He is my shield, and the strength of my salvation, my stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah should be praised. I called on him, and I was saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The cords of death surrounded me. The torrents of wickedness frightened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cords of the grave surrounded me. The snares of death confronted me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I called on Jehovah in my distress. I cried to my God for help. He heard my voice from his temple, and my cry for help reached his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth shook and quaked. Even the foundations of the mountains trembled. They shook violently because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Smoke went up from his nostrils. A raging fire came out of his mouth. Glowing coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He spread apart the heavens and came down with a dark cloud under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He rode on a cherub and he flew. Yes he did soar on the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made the darkness his hiding place, his pavilion round about, the dark rain clouds his covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Out of the brightness in front of him, those rain clouds passed by with hailstones and lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah thundered in the heavens. The Most High made his voice heard with hailstones and lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shot his arrows and scattered them. He flashed streaks of lightning to agitate disturb and trouble them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The ocean floor could be seen. The foundations of the earth were laid bare at your stern warning, O Jehovah, at the blast of the breath from your nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He reached down from high above and took hold of me. He pulled me out of the raging water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, because they were too strong for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On the day of my calamity, they confronted me, and Jehovah came to my support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He brought me out to a wide-open place. He rescued me because he was pleased with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jehovah rewarded me because of my righteousness, because my hands are clean. He paid me back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have kept the ways of Jehovah and I have not wickedly turned away from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All his judgments are in front of me and I have not turned away from his laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was innocent as far as he was concerned. I have kept myself from guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jehovah paid me back because of my righteousness. He can see that my hands are clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In dealing with faithful people you are faithful. With innocent people you are innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With pure people you are pure. In dealing with devious people you are clever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You save humble people, but you humiliate the proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>O Jehovah, you light my lamp. My God turns my darkness into light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>With you I can attack a line of soldiers. With my God I can break through barricades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>God's way is perfect! The word of Jehovah has proven to be true. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who is God but Jehovah? Who is a rock except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>God arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He makes my feet sure-footed on high places just like those of a deer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He trains my hands for battle so that my arms can bend an archer's bow of bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>You have given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand supports me. Your gentleness humilitymeekness makes me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You make a wide path for me to walk on so that my feet do not slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I chased my enemies and caught up with them. I did not return until I had ended their lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I wounded them so badly that they were unable to get up. They fell under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You armed me with strength for battle. You made my opponents bow at my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You made my enemies turn their backs to me. I destroyed those who hated me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They cried out for help, but there was no one to save them. They cried out to Jehovah, but he did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I beat them into powder as fine as the dust blown by the wind. I threw them out as though they were dirt on the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You rescued me from my conflicts with the people. You made me the leader of nations. A people I did not know will serve me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me. Foreigners will cringe in front of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Foreigners will lose heart lose courage. They will tremble when they come out of their fortifications.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jehovah lives! Blessed is my rock! Praise the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>God gives me vengeance! He brings people under my authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He saves me from my enemies. You lift me up above my opponents. You rescue me from violent people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>That is why I will give thanks to you, O Jehovah, among the nations and make music to praise your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He gives great victories to his king. He shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his descendants forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
