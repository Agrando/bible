They sprout again in the morning like grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the morning they blossom and sprout. In the evening they fade and wither away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your anger consumes us. We are troubled by your rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You set our sins in front of you.

How long? Change your plans about us, your servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Satisfy us every morning with your loving kindness so that we may sing for joy and rejoice all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Make us rejoice for as many days as you have made us suffer, for as many years as we have experienced evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your servants see what you can do. Let our children see your majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the kindness of Jehovah our God be with us. Confirm for us the work of our hands.
