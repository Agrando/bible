When shall I come and appear before God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all day long: Where is your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I remember these things and I pour out my heart within me. I used to go along with the crowd and lead them in procession to the house of God, with the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why am I discouraged? Why am I so restless? I put my hope in God for I will still praise him. He is my salvation and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am very discouraged.

Why must I walk around in mourning while the enemy oppresses me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me, while they say to me all day long: »Where is your God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why am I in despair? Why have I become disturbed within me? Wait for God for I shall yet praise him, the help of my countenance and my God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
