They had almost slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I was envious of arrogant people when I saw the peace and prosperity that wicked people enjoy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They suffer no pain. Their bodies are healthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They have no drudgery in their lives like ordinary people. They are not plagued with problems like mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That is why arrogance is their necklace and violence covers them like clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their eyes stand out with fatness, and their heartÂ’s imagination run wild.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They ridicule. They speak maliciously. They speak arrogantly about oppression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They set their mouth in the heavens and their tongue parades through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore his people return here and here they drink waters of abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They ask: How does God know? And is there knowledge with the most High?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these are the ungodly. They prosper in the world; they increase in wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have been plagued all day long, and chastened every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I say, I will speak thus; then, I would offend the generation of your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I understood their end when I went into the sanctuary of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Surely you set them in slippery places. You threw them down into destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How are they destroyed, suddenly! They are utterly consumed with terrors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It is like waking up from a dream, O Jehovah. When you awake you will despise everything they represent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My heart was grieved and I was pierced within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I was so foolish and ignorant: I was like a beast before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless I am continually with you. You hold me by my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward you give me honor glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who have I in heaven but you? I desire none on earth except you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My flesh and my heart fail: God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Those who are far from you will perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>It is good for me to draw near to God. I have put my trust in Jehovah God, that I may declare all your works.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
