Oh give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good and His loving-kindness endures forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can speak of the mighty acts deeds of Jehovah? Who can proclaim and perceive all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>How blessed are those who pay attention to justice, who practice righteousness at all times!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O Jehovah, with favor toward your people. Visit me with your salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Help me see the prosperity of your chosen ones that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned like our fathers! We have committed iniquity and have behaved wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers in Egypt did not understand your wonders. They did not remember your abundant kindnesses. But they rebelled by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless he saved them for the sake of his name that he might make his power known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up, and he led them through the deeps, as through the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He saved them from the hand of the one who hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The waters covered their adversaries and not one of them was left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed his words. They sang His praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They quickly forgot his works and they did not wait for his counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They had an unreasonable desire for food in the wilderness. In the desert they tested God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He gave them what they asked for. He also gave them a degenerative disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the camp certain men became envious of Moses. They also became envious of Aaron, JehovahÂ’s holy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The ground split open and swallowed Dathan. It buried Abiram's followers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A fire broke out among their followers. Flames burned up wicked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>At Mount Horeb they made a statue of a calf. They worshiped an idol made of metal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They traded their glorious God for the statue of a bull that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot the God of their salvation, the one who did spectacular things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>miracles in the land of Ham, and terrifying things at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>God said he was going to destroy them, but Moses, his chosen one, stood in his way to prevent him from exterminating them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They refused to enter the pleasant land. They did not believe what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They complained in their tents. They did not obey Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Raising his hand, he swore that he would kill them in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>kill their descendants among the nations, and scatter them throughout various lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They joined in worshiping the god Baal while they were at Peor. They ate what was sacrificed to the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They infuriated God by what they did, and a plague broke out among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Phinehas stood between God and the people, and the plague was stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because of this, Phinehas was considered righteous forever, throughout every generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They made God angry by the water at Meribah. Things turned out badly for Moses because of what they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They made him bitter so that he spoke recklessly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the people as Jehovah had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Instead, they intermarried with other nations. They learned to do what other nations did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They worshiped their idols, which became a trap for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They shed innocent blood, the blood of their own sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land became polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They became filthy because of what they did. They behaved like prostitutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jehovah burned with anger against his own people. He was disgusted with those who belonged to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He handed them over to other nations, and those who hated them ruled them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies oppressed them and made them subject to their power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He rescued them many times, but they continued to plot rebellion against him and to sink deeper because of their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He saw that they were suffering when he heard their cry for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He remembered his promise to them. In keeping with his rich mercy, he changed his plans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He let them find compassion from all those who held them captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Rescue us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the nations so that we may give thanks to your holy name and make your praise our glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Thanks be to Jehovah the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say amen. Praise Jehovah!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
