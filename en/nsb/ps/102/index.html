And let my cry for help come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Incline your ear to me. In the day when I call answer me quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My days have been consumed in smoke, and my bones have been scorched like a hearth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart has been stricken like grass and has withered away. In fact I forget to eat my bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because of the loudness of my groaning my bones cling to my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I resemble a pelican of the wilderness. I have become like an owl of the waste places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I lie awake, I have become like a lonely bird on a housetop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All day long my enemies have reproached me. Those who deride me used my name as a curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is because of your indignation and your anger. You have lifted me up and cast me away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My days are like a lengthened shadow and I wither away like grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But You, O Jehovah, remain forever. Your name is for all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You will arise and have compassion on Zion. It is time to be gracious to her for the appointed time has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your servants find pleasure in her stones and feel pity for her dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the nations will respect the name of Jehovah and all the kings of the earth will honor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Jehovah has built up Zion. He has appeared in His glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He has respected the prayer of the destitute and has not despised their prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This will be written for the generation to come: That a people yet to be created may praise Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He looked down from his holy height. Jehovah gazed upon the earth from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He heard the groaning of the prisoner, to set free those who were doomed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Let men tell of the Jehovahs name in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the peoples and kingdoms are gathered together to serve Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He has weakened my strength in the way and has shortened my days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I say: »O my God, do not take me away in the middle of my days, your years are throughout all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»You founded the earth of old. The heavens are the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»They will perish, but you endure. All of them will wear out like a garment; like clothing you will renew them and they will be renewed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»But you are the same. Your years will not come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»The children of your servants will continue, and their descendants will be established before you.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
