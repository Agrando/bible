O Jehovah my God, You are very great! You are clothed with splendor and majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You cover yourself with light as with a cloak. You stretch out clouds in the sky like a curtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You lay the beams of your upper chambers in the waters. You make the clouds your chariot. You walk upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You make the winds your messengers, the flaming fire your ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You established the earth upon its foundations, so that it will not be unstable forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You covered it with the deep like a garment. The waters stood above the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They fled at your rebuke. At the sound of your thunder they hurried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The mountains rose and the valleys sank down to the place you appointed for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You set a boundary that they may not go beyond. They will not return to cover the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You send watering springs to the valleys. They flow between the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They give drink to every beast of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell. They lift up voices among the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You water the mountains from your upper chambers. The earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You cause the grass to grow for the cattle and vegetation for the labor of man. That he may bring forth food from the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And wine which makes man's heart glad. That he may make his face shine with oil, and food, which sustains man's heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>JehovahÂ’s trees drink their fill, the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Where the birds build their nests, the stork, whose home is the fir tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The high mountains are for the wild goats. The cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You made the moon for the seasons. The sun knows the place of its setting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You appoint darkness and it becomes night, when all the forest animals prowl about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They withdraw at sunrise and lie down in their dens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Man goes to his work and to his labor until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O Jehovah, how many are your works! In wisdom you have made them all. The earth is full of your possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sea is so big and wide with many creatures, living things both large and small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ships sail on it, and Leviathan great sea animal, which you made, plays in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All of them wait for you to give them their food at the proper time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You give it to them, and they gather it up. You open your hand, and they are satisfied with many blessings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You hide your face, and they are frightened. You take away their breath, and they die and return to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>You send out your Spirit, and they are created. You renew the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let the glory of Jehovah endure forever. May Jehovah find joy in his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I will sing to Jehovah throughout my life. I will make music to praise my God as long as I live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>May my thoughts be pleasing to him. I will find joy in Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let sinners be consumed from the world. Let the wicked no longer exist. Bless Jehovah with all my being! Praise Jehovah!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
