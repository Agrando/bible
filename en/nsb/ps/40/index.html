He set my feet upon a rock and made me stand erect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see, respect and trust in Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed is the man who has made Jehovah his security. He has not turned to the proud, or to those who turn aside into falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O Jehovah my God, Many are the wonders that you have done and your thoughts toward us. None can compare with you. If I would declare and teach about them, they would be too numerous to report.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have not desired sacrifice and meal offering. You have opened my ears. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said: »Here I come! In the scroll of the book it is written about me. (Luke 3:21)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I am pleased to do your will, O my God; Your Law is within my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I announced the good news of righteousness in the great congregation. I will not close my lips. You know that, O Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I have not hidden your righteousness deep in my heart. I have been outspoken about your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not hidden your mercy and your truth from the great congregation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not withhold your compassion from me, O Jehovah. May your mercy and your truth always protect me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Countless evils have surrounded me. My sins have caught up with me so that I can no longer see. They outnumber the hairs on my head. I have lost heart lost strength, courage and motivation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O Jehovah, please rescue me! Come quickly to help me, O Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let all those who seek to end my life be confused and put to shame. Let those who want my downfall be turned back and disgraced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let those who say to me: Aha! Aha! Be stunned by their shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say: Jehovah is greatly magnified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I am oppressed and needy. May Jehovah think of me. You are my help and my salvation. O my God, do not delay!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
