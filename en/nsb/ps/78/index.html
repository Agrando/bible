Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth in an illustration. I will utter dark sayings of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That we have heard and known and our fathers have told us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not conceal them from their children, but tell to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength and his wondrous works that he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel. This he commanded our fathers that they should teach them to their children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That the generation to come might know, the children to be born, that they may arise and tell to their children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That they should put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God but keep his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not prepare its heart and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The sons of Ephraim were archers well equipped with bows. Yet they turned and ran in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They did not keep the covenant of God. They refused to walk in his law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They forgot his deeds and his miracles that he had shown them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He wrought wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He divided the sea and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand up like a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He led them with the cloud by day and with a light of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them abundant drink like the ocean depths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He brought forth streams also from the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet they still continued to sin against him. They rebelled against the Most High in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In their heart they put God to the test by asking food according to their desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they spoke against God. They said: Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out, and streams were overflowing; Can He give bread also? Will He provide meat for His people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore Jehovah heard and was full of wrath. A fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also mounted against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet he commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them food from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man did eat the bread of angels. He sent them food in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens and by his power he directed the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He rained meat upon them like the dust, even winged fowl like the sand of the seas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he let them fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they ate and were well filled, and their desire he gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Before they had satisfied their desire, while their food was in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The anger of God rose against them and killed some of their stoutest ones, and subdued the choice men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In spite of all this they still sinned. They did not believe in his wonderful works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He brought their days to an end like a whisper in the wind. He brought their years to an end in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he killed some of them, the rest searched for him. They turned from their sins and eagerly looked for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They remembered that God was their rock, that the Most High was their defender.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They flattered him with their mouths and lied to him with their tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Their hearts were not loyal to him. They were not faithful to his promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he is compassionate. He forgave their sin. He did not destroy them. He restrained his anger many times. He did not display all of his fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He remembered that they were only flesh and blood, a breeze that blows and does not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness! How often they caused him grief in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They tested God again and again, and they pushed the Holy One of Israel to the limit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They did not remember his power and the day he freed them from their oppressor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>when he performed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the fields of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He turned their rivers into blood so that they could not drink from their streams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent a swarm of flies that bit them and frogs that ruined them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He gave their crops to grasshoppers and their produce to locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He killed their vines with hail and their fig trees with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He let the hail strike their cattle and bolts of lightning strike their livestock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He sent his fierce burning anger, his rage and fury against them. He sent an army of destroying angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He cleared a path for his anger. He did not spare them from death. He let the plague take their lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He destroyed every firstborn in Egypt, the ones born in the tents of Ham when their fathers were young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He led his own people out like sheep and guided them like a flock through the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He led them safely. They had no fear while the sea covered their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He brought them into his holy land, to this mountain that his power had won.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He drove nations out of their way and gave them the land of the nations as their inheritance. He settled the tribes of Israel in their own tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They tested God Most High and rebelled against him. They did not obey his written instructions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>They were disloyal and treacherous like their ancestors. They were like arrows shot from a defective bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>They provoked him to anger indignation because of their illegal worship sites. They made him furious because they worshiped idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When God heard, he became furious. He greatly abhorred Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>He abandoned his dwelling place in Shiloh, the tent where he had lived among humans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>He allowed his power to be taken captive and handed his glory over to an oppressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He let swords kill his people. He was furious with those who belonged to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Fire consumed his best young men, so his virgins were not given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>His priests were cut down with swords. The widows of his priests could not even weep for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Jehovah woke up like one who had been sleeping, like a warrior sobering up from too much wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>He struck his enemies from behind and disgraced them forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>He rejected the tent of Joseph. He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>He built his holy place to be like the high heavens, like the earth that he made to last for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He chose his servant David. He took him from the sheep pens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He brought him from tending the ewes that had lambs so that David could be the shepherd of the people of Jacob, of Israel, the people who belonged to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>With unselfish devotion David became their shepherd. With skill he guided them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
