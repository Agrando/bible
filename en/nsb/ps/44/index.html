Then you planted them; you afflicted the peoples and spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>It was not with their swords that they took possession of the land. They did not gain victory with their own strength. It was your right hand, your arm power, and the light of your presence that did it, because you were pleased with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You alone are my king, O God. You won those victories for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>With you we can walk over our enemies. With your name we can trample those who attack us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I do not rely on my bow, and my sword will never save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You saved us from our adversaries. You put to shame those who hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All day long we praise our God. We give thanks to your name forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yet you have rejected and disgraced us. You do not even go along with our armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You make us retreat from the enemy. Those who hate us rob us at will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You give us over to be butchered like sheep and scatter us among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You sell your people for almost nothing, and at that price you have gained nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You made us a reproach to our neighbors and an object of ridicule and contempt to those around us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You made our defeat a proverb among the nations so that people shake their heads at us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All day long my disgrace is in front of me. Shame covers my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is because of the words of those who insult and slander us, because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Although all of this happened to us, we never forgot you. We never ignored your promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Our hearts never turned away. Our feet never left your path.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You crushed us in a place for jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If we forgot the name of our God or stretched out our hands to pray to another god,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>would God not find out, since he knows the secrets in our hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>We are being killed all day long because of you. We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Wake up! Why are you sleeping, O Jehovah? Awake! Do not reject us forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our suffering and misery?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>We are bowing in the dust. Our bodies cling to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Arise! Help us! Rescue us because of your loving kindness!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
