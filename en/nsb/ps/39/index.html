I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle while the wicked are in my presence.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was silent and refrained from good. My sorrow grew worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My heart grew hot within me. A fire would kindle during my meditation. Then I spoke with my tongue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Jehovah, please make me to know my end. What is the extent of my days? Let me know how temporary fraildestitute I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Indeed, you have made the length of my days very short. My life span is nothing compared to yours. Certainly, everyone alive is like a whisper in the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Every man walks about like a vain illusion. He makes a lot of noise over nothing. He hoards riches and does not know who will receive them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Jehovah, for what do I wait? My hope is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Deliver me from all my sin. Do not disgrace me in front of godless fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I remained speechless. I did not open my mouth because you have done this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Remove the plague you laid upon me. My life is over because you apposed me with your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»With stern reproof you discipline people for their iniquity. Like a moth you consume what is dear to them. Certainly, everyone is like a breath of air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Hear my prayer, O Jehovah. Open your ear listen to my cry for help. Do not be deaf to my tears, for I am a foreign resident with you, a stranger like all my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Look away from me so that I may smile again before I go away and am no more.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
