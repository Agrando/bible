Let those who hate him run from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As smoke is driven away, drive them away: as wax melts before the fire, let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But let the righteous be glad. Let them rejoice before God: yes, let them exceedingly rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Sing to God, sing praises to his name: extol him who rides upon the heavens by his name, Jehovah, and rejoice before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In his holy habitation God is a father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God sets the lonely in families. He frees the prisoners who are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O God, when you went before your people, when you march through the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: Sinai was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You, O God, did send a plentiful rain. You confirm your inheritance with it, when it was parched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Your congregation lived there. You O God have prepared your goodness for the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah gave the word: The women who proclaim the good news are a large army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They say: The kings of the armies flee; they run away. The women who remained at home will divide the goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Though you stayed among the sheep pens, you will be like the wings of a dove covered with silver, its feathers with yellow gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Meanwhile, the Almighty was still scattering kings there like snow falling on Mount Zalmon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The mountain of Bashan is the mountain of God. The mountain of Bashan is the mountain with many peaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Why do you look with envy desiregreed, you mountains with many peaks, at the mountain where God has chosen to live? Certainly, Jehovah will live there forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The chariots of God are myriads in number, thousands upon thousands. Jehovah is among them. The God of Sinai is in his holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You went to the highest place. You took prisoners captive. You have received gifts in the form of people, even from among rebellious people, so that Jehovah God may live there with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thanks be to Jehovah, who daily carries our burdens for us. God is our salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our God is the God of deliverance. Jehovah of Hosts is our escape from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Certainly, God will crush the heads of his enemies and destroy even the hair on the heads of those who continue to be guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jehovah said: I will bring them back from Bashan. I will bring them back from the depths of the sea</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>so that you, my people, may bathe your feet in blood and the tongues of your dogs may lick the blood of your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O God, Your festival processions can be seen by everyone. They are the processions for my God, my king, into the holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The singers are in front. The musicians are behind them. The young women beating tambourines are between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Praise Jehovah our God with choirs for He is the foundation of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Benjamin, the youngest, is leading them, next the leaders of Judah with their noisy crowds, then the leaders of Zebulun, and then the leaders of Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Your God has decided you will be strong. Display your strength, O God, as you have for us before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Kings will bring you gifts because of your temple high above Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Threaten the beast that is among the cattails, the herd of bulls with the calves of the nations, until it humbles itself with pieces of silver. Scatter the people who find joy in war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Ambassadors will come from Egypt. Sudan will stretch out its hands to God in prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You kingdoms of the world, sing to God. Make music to praise Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God rides through the highest heavens, which are from ancient times, the highest heaven. Listen! He makes his powerful voice heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Acknowledge the power of God. His majesty is over Israel, and his power is in the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>God, the God of Israel, is awe-inspiring in his holy place. He gives strength and power to his people. Praise God!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
