Why do you hide in times of trouble?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The wicked proudly persecutes the poor people. He will be caught in the schemes that he contrived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The wicked person boasts about his selfish desires. He blesses the covetous, which Jehovah abhors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In his arrogant attitude he does not search for God. His faulty reasoning concludes: »There is no God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He always succeeds at what he does. Your judgments are beyond his understanding. He scoffs at all his opponents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He says to himself: »Nothing can shake me. I will never face trouble.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>His mouth is full of curses, deception, and oppression. Trouble and wrongdoing are on the tip of his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He waits in ambush in the villages. From his hiding places he kills innocent people. He searches for victims.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He lurks in his hiding place like a lion in his den. He hides there to catch oppressed people. He catches oppressed people after he draws them into his net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His victims are crushed. They collapse, and they fall into the power of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He says in his heart to himself: »God has forgotten. He has hidden his face. He will never see it!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Arise, O Jehovah! Lift your hand, O God. Do not forget oppressed people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why does the wicked person despise God? Why does he say in his heart: »God does not require it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You have seen trouble and grief and placed them under your control. The victim entrusts himself to you. You alone have been the helper of orphans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Break the arm of the wicked and evil person. Pursue his wickedness until you find no more evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah is king forever and ever. The nations have vanished from his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You have heard the desire of humble people, O Jehovah. You encourage them. You incline your ear pay close attention to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You provide justice for orphans and oppressed people so that no man will terrify them again.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
