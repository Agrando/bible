Why are you so far away from my deliverance, so far away from the words of my moaning?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer. I cry by night, but I find no rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yet you are holy, you who dwell seated on the praises of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Our ancestors trusted you. They trusted, and you delivered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They cried to you and were delivered. They trusted you and were never disappointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet, I am a worm and not a man. I am scorned by humanity and despised by people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All who see me laugh at me. Insults pour from their mouths. They shake their heads and say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Put yourself in Jehovahs hands. Let Jehovah save him! Let God rescue him since he is pleased with him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You are the one who brought me out of the womb. You made me feel safe at my mother's breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I was placed in your care from birth. From my mother's womb you have been my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not be so far away from me. Trouble is near, and there is no one to help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Many bulls have surrounded me. Strong bulls from Bashan have encircled me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They opened their mouths to attack me like ferocious, roaring lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am poured out like water. All my bones are out of joint. My heart has melted within me like wax I am weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My power is dried up like pieces of broken pottery. My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You lay me down in the dust of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Dogs have surrounded me. A mob has encircled me. They have pierced my hands and feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I can count all my bones. People stare and gloat over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They divide my clothes among themselves. They cast lots throw dice for my clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not stay far off, O Jehovah. Come quickly to assist me, O my strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rescue me from the sword, my life from vicious dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Save me from the mouth of the lion and from the horns of wild oxen. You have answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will tell my people about your name. I will praise you within the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All who reverence Jehovah, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob honor him! Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jehovah has not despised or been disgusted with the plight of the oppressed one. He has not hidden his face from that person. Jehovah heard when that oppressed person cried out to him for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>My praise comes from you while I am among those assembled for worship. I will fulfill my vows in the presence of those who respect Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Humble meek people will eat until they are full. Those who look to Jehovah will praise him. May your heart live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All the ends of the earth will remember and return to Jehovah. All the families from all the nations will worship you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This is because the kingdom belongs to Jehovah and he rules the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>All prosperous people on earth will eat and worship. All those who go down to the dust will kneel in front of him, even those who are barely alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There will be descendants who serve him, a generation that will be told about Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They will tell people yet to be born about the righteousness he has performed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
