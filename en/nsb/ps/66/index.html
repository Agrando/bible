Make his praise glorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Say to God: How awe-inspiring are your deeds! Your power is so great that your enemies will cringe in front of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The whole earth will worship you. They will sing praises to you. They will make music to praise your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Come and see the works of God, his awe-inspiring deeds for the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He turned the sea into dry land. They crossed the river on foot. We rejoiced because of what he did there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He rules forever with his might. His eyes watch the nations. Rebels will not be able to oppose him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bless our God, you peoples. Make the sound of his praise heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He has kept us alive and has not allowed us to fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have tested us, O God. You have refined us in the same way silver is refined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You have trapped us in a net. You have laid burdens on our backs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You let people ride over our heads. We went through fire and water, but then you brought us out and refreshed us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will come into your temple with burnt offerings. I will keep my vows to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>the vows made by my lips and spoken by my own mouth when I was in trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will offer you a sacrifice of fattened livestock for burnt offerings with the smoke from rams. I will offer cattle and goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come and listen, all who reverence God, and I will tell you what he has done for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>With my mouth I cried out to him. High praise was on my tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I had thought about doing anything sinful, Jehovah would not have listened to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But God has heard me. He paid attention to my prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thanks be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or taken away his loving kindness from me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
