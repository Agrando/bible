Protect me from those who attack me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Deliver me from troublemakers. Save me from bloodthirsty people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They lie in ambush for me right here! Fierce men attack me, O Jehovah, but not because of any disobedience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And not because any sin or any guilt on my part. They hurry to take positions against me. Wake up, and help me; see for yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O Jehovah God of Hosts, God of Israel, arise to punish all the nations. Have no pity on any who pursue iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They return in the evening. They howl like dogs. They prowl the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>See what pours out of their mouths, swords from their lips! They think: Who will hear us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O Jehovah, you laugh at them. You make fun of all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O my strength, I watch for you!

He will let me gloat over those who spy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not kill them. Otherwise, my people may forget. Make them wander aimlessly by your power. Bring them down, O Jehovah, our shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is because of the sins from their mouths and the words on their lips. Let them be trapped by their own arrogance because they speak curses and lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Destroy them in your rage. Destroy them until not one of them is left. Then they will know that God rules Jacob to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They return in the evening. They howl like dogs. They prowl the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They wander around to find food. If they are not full enough, they will stay all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I will sing about your strength. In the morning I will joyfully sing about your loving-kindness. You have been my stronghold and a place of safety in times of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O my strength, I will make music to praise you!
