Never let me be put to shame. Deliver me because of your righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Turn your ear toward me. Rescue me quickly. Be a rock of refuge for me, a stronghold fortress to save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You are my rock and my stronghold. For the sake of your name, lead me and guide me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are my refuge. Pull me out of the net that they have secretly laid for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Into your hands I entrust my spirit. You have redeemed me, O Jehovah, God of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I hate those who cling to false gods, but I do trust in Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will rejoice and be glad because of your loving-kindness mercy. You have seen my misery. You have known my troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You have not handed me over to the hand of the enemy. You have set my feet in a large place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be gracious to me, O Jehovah, because I am in distress. My eyes, my life, and my body waste away with grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My life is spent from sorrow, my years from groaning. My strength staggers under the weight of my guilt, and my bones waste away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become a disgrace because of all my opponents. I have become someone dreaded by my friends, even by my neighbors. Those who see me on the street run away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have faded from memory as if I were dead and have become like a piece of broken pottery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have heard the whispering of many people, terror on every side, while they made plans together against me. They were plotting to take my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I trust you, O Jehovah. I said: »You are my God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My future is in your hands. Rescue me from my enemies, from those who persecute me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Make your face shine on me smile on meshow me favorbe kind and merciful to me. Save me in your loving-kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O Jehovah, I have called on you, so do not let me be put to shame. Let wicked people be put to shame. Let them be silent in the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let their lying lips be speechless, since they speak against righteous people with arrogance and contempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your goodness is so great! You reserve it for those who respect you. The sons of men watch as you show it to those who take refuge in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You hide them in the secret place of your presence from those who scheme against them. You keep them in a secret shelter, safe from quarrelsome tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed is Jehovah! He has shown me the miracle of his loving-kindness in a city under attack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When I was panic-stricken, I said: I have been cut off from your sight. But you heard my pleas for mercy when I cried out to you for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Love Jehovah, all you godly ones! Jehovah protects faithful people, but he pays back in full those who act arrogantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Be strong, all who wait with hope for Jehovah, and let your heart be courageous.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
