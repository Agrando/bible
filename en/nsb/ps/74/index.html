Why do you smoke with anger against the sheep of your pasture?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Remember your congregation, which you purchased long ago. For you have redeemed it to be the tribe of your inheritance, Mount Zion, in which you have lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They behaved like men wielding axes cutting through a thicket of trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They strike down all its carved work with hatchet and hammers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling-place of your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They said in their hearts: »We will destroy them completely. They burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We see no miraculous signs. There is no longer any prophet. There is no one who knows how long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How long, God, will the adversary reproach? Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it out of your pocket and consume them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the middle of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You divided the sea by your strength. You broke the heads of the sea monsters Egypts Army in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You opened up spring and stream. You dried up mighty rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The day and the night are yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You have set all the boundaries of the earth. You have made summer and winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Jehovah. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not deliver your turtledove endeared to wild beasts. Do not forget the life of your poor forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not let the oppressed return ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Arise, O God! Plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish man treats you with contempt all day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do not forget the voice of your adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
