They speak against me with lying tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They surround me with hateful words. They fight against me without reason.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In return for my love, they accuse me, but I pray for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They reward me with evil instead of good and with hatred instead of love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Appoint the evil one to oppose him. Let an accuser stand at his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he stands trial, let him be found guilty. Let his prayer be considered sinful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let his days be few in number. Let someone else take his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let his children become fatherless and his wife a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let his children wander around and beg. Let them seek help far from their ruined homes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let a creditor take everything he owns. Let strangers steal what he has worked for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let no one be kind to him anymore. Let no one show any pity to his fatherless children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let his descendants be cut off and their family name be wiped out by the next generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let Jehovah remember the guilt of his ancestors and not wipe out his mother's sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let their guilt and sin always remain on record in front of Jehovah. Let Jehovah remove every memory of him from the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for he did not remember to be kind. He drove oppressed, needy, and brokenhearted people to their graves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He loved to put curses on others, so he, too, was cursed. He did not like to bless others, so he never received a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He wore cursing as though it were clothing; so cursing entered his body like water and his bones like oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let cursing be his clothing, a belt he always wears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is how Jehovah rewards those who accuse me, those who say evil things against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>O Lord Jehovah, deal with me out of the goodness of your name. Rescue me because of your loving kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I am oppressed and needy. I feel pain in my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I fade away like a lengthening shadow. I have been shaken off like a grasshopper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My knees give way because I have been fasting. My body has become lean, without any fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have become the victim of my enemies' insults. They look at me and shake their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Help me, O Jehovah my God. Save me because of your loving kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they will know that this is your doing, that you, O Jehovah, are the one who saved me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They may curse, but you will bless. Let those who attack me be ashamed, but let your servant rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let those who accuse me wear disgrace as though it were clothing. Let them be wrapped in their shame as though it were a robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>With my mouth I will give many thanks to Jehovah. I will praise him among many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He stands at the right hand of the needy people to save them from those who would condemn them to death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
