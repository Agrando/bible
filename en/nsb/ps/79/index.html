They have dishonored defiled your holy temple. They have left Jerusalem in ruins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They have given the dead bodies of your servants to the birds for food. They have given the flesh of your godly ones to the animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They have shed the blood of your people around Jerusalem as though it were water.
