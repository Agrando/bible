His loving kindness endures forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let the redeemed by Jehovah say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And gathered out of the lands, from the east sunrise and from the west sunset, from the north and from the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way. They found no city to live in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry and thirsty, they fainted within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they cried to Jehovah in their trouble. He delivered them out of their distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He led them also by a straight way that they might go to a city to live in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let them praise Jehovah for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he satisfies the thirsty and the hungry person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those who lived in the dark, in death's shadow were prisoners in misery. They were held in iron chains</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They had rebelled against God's words and had despised the advice given by the Most High.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He humbled them with hard work. They fell down, but no one was there to help them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In their distress they cried out to Jehovah. He saved them from their troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He brought them out of the dark, out of death's shadow. He broke apart their chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them give thanks to Jehovah because of his goodness. He performed his miracles for the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He shattered bronze gates and cut iron bars in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools suffered because of their disobedience and because of their crimes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All food was disgusting to them, and they came near death's gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In their distress they cried out to Jehovah. He saved them from their troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sent his message and healed them. He rescued them from the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Let them give thanks to Jehovah because of his goodness. He performed his miracles for the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let them bring songs of thanksgiving as their sacrifice.

They plunged into the depths. Their courage failed in the face of disaster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reeled and staggered like drunks, and all their skills as sailors became useless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In their distress they cried out to Jehovah. He led them from their troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He made the storm calm down, and the waves became still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The sailors were glad that the storm was quiet. He guided them to the harbor they had longed for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let them give thanks to Jehovah because of his goodness. He performed his miracles for the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let them glorify him when the people are gathered for worship. Let them praise him in the company of respected leaders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He changes rivers into a desert, springs into thirsty ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and fertile ground into a layer of salt because of the wickedness of the people living there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He changes deserts into lakes marshland and dry ground into springs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>There he settles those who are hungry, and they build cities to live in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They plant in fields and vineyards that produce crops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He blesses them, and their numbers multiply, and he does not allow a shortage of cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They became few in number and were humiliated because of oppression, disaster, and sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He poured contempt on their influential people and made them stumble around in a pathless desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He lifts needy people high above suffering and makes their families like flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The righteous will see this and rejoice, but all the wicked will shut their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Let those who think they are wise pay attention to these things so they will understand the loving kindness of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
