You understand my thought from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You inspect my path and my lying down. You are intimately acquainted with my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Even before I speak words from my tongue, behold, O Jehovah, You know it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have enclosed me behind and before, and laid your hand upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Knowing this is too wonderful for me! It is too high, I cannot attain to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Where can I go from your Spirit? Or where can I flee from your presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I ascend to heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in the grave, behold, you are there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even there your hand will lead me. Your right hand will lay hold of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I say: »Certainly the darkness will overwhelm me!« Then the light around me will be night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Even the darkness is not dark to you. And the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you formed my inward parts. You wove me in my mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will praise you, for in an awesome way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful and I know this very well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My frame was not hidden from you, when I was made in secret, and woven in the depths of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your eyes saw my embryo and all were written in your book; the days ordained for me. Even this before one had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How precious are your thoughts to me, O God! How numerous is the sum of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you would destroy the wicked, O God, depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they speak against you wickedly. Your enemies take your name in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do I not hate those who hate You, O Jehovah? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I hate them with the utmost hatred! They have become my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Examine me, O God, and know my heart. Test me and know my anxious troubledpainfuldisturbing thoughts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>See if there is any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
