Do not hide from my plea for favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Pay attention to me, and answer me. My thoughts are restless. I am confused and distracted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is because my enemy shouts at me and a wicked person persecutes me. They bring misery crashing down on me, and they attack me out of anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart is in turmoil within me. The terrors of death have seized me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fear and trembling have overcome me. Horror has overwhelmed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I said: If only I had wings like a dove. I would fly away and find rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I would run far away. I would stay in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I would hurry to a place of refuge from the raging wind and storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Confuse their language, O Jehovah, because I see violence and conflict in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Day and night they go around on top of the city walls. Trouble and misery are everywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Destruction is everywhere. Oppression and fraud never leave the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If an enemy had insulted me, then I could tolerate it. If someone who hated me had attacked me, then I could hide from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But it is you, my equal, my close friend, and a well-known companion!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We took sweet fellowship together and walked into God's house with the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let death suddenly take them! Let them go into the grave while they are still alive, for evil lives in their homes and within them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I call on God, and Jehovah saves me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Morning, noon, and night I complain and murmur. He listens to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In peace he will rescue me from the war waged against me. There are many against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God will listen and answer them. The one who has sat enthroned from the beginning will deal with them. They never change. They never respect God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him. He has violated his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His speech was smoother than butter, but his heart was war! His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Throw your burden upon Jehovah and he will sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be shaken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But You, O God, will bring them down to the corruption of the grave. Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
