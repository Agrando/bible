With my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For I have said: »Loving-kindness will be built up forever. You will establish your faithfulness in the heavens.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I made a covenant with my chosen; I swore to David my servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The heavens will praise your wonders, O Jehovah, Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For who in the heavens is comparable to Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is a God greatly reverenced in the council of the holy ones.

Your hand is mighty power by Holy Spirit; your right hand is exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loving kindness and truth go before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>How blessed are the people who know the joyful sound! O Jehovah, they walk in the light of your countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They rejoice in your name all the day. They are exalted in your righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you are the glory of their strength and by your favor our horn strength is exalted increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For our shield belongs to Jehovah, and our king to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Once you spoke in vision to your godly ones. You said: »I have given help to one who is mighty. I have exalted one chosen from the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have found David my servant.

He has become the object of his neighbors' scorn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>You lifted up the right hand of his enemies and made all of his adversaries rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You even took his sword out of his hand and failed to support him in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You put an end to his splendor and hurled his throne to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You cut short the days of his youth and covered him with shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>How long, O Jehovah? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your anger continue to burn like fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Remember how short my life span is! Have you created the sons of men for no reason?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Can man go on living and never see death? Who can set himself free from the power of the grave?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Where is the evidence of your mercy, Lord? You swore an oath to David on the basis of your faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jehovah, remember the reproach of your servant. Remember how I have carried in my heart the insults from so many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Your enemies insulted me. They insulted your anointed every step he took.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Blessed be Jehovah forevermore! Amen and Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
