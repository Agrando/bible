Seven trumpets were given to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Another angel, with a golden incense vessel, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense so he could offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones upon the golden altar before the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the holy ones, ascended up, out of the angel's hand, before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The angel took the incense vessel, and filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth. There were voices, and thundering and lightning, and an earthquake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood came down upon the earth. A third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The second angel blew his trumpet. Something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A third of the living creatures in the sea died. And a third of the ships were destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The third angel blew his trumpet. A great star burning like a lamp fell from heaven. It fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The star is called Wormwood CalamityBitterness: and a third of the waters became wormwood; and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was struck. A third of the moon, and a third of the stars were darkened. The illumination of both day and night was cut by one third.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw and heard an angel flying in midheaven. He said with a loud voice: "Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
