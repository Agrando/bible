Christ then sent his angel to communicate the symbolic message to his servant John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>John testified to the word of God, the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all that he saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Happy is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and obey the things written in it: for the time is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John, to the seven congregations in Asia: May you have grace and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And from Jesus Christ, who is the Faithful Witness, and the firstborn from the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and released us from our sins by his blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He made us to be a kingdom of kings and priests to his God and Father.

It sounded like a trumpet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It said: "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven congregations in Asia: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. When I turned, I saw seven golden lamp stands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There was someone like the Son of man in the midst of the seven lamp stands. He was clothed with a garment that reached down to the feet, and girded at the chest with a golden girdle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were like a flame of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His feet were like fine brass glowing in a furnace. His voice sounded like many rushing waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In his right hand he held seven stars. A sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth. His appearance was like the shinning sun in full strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When I saw him, I fell as dead at his feet. He laid his right hand on me and said: "Do not fear. I am the first and the last:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"I am alive! I was dead and, behold, I am alive forever, Amen. I have the keys of death and the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Write the things that you have seen and the things that are and the things that will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"This is the secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp stands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven congregations. The seven lamp stands that you saw are the seven congregations."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
