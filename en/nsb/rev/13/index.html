I saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns. His horns had ten crowns on them. Blasphemous names were on his heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The beast I saw looked like a leopard. His feet were like the feet of a bear. His mouth was like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power, his throne, and great authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>One of his heads appeared to have had a fatal wound. His fatal wound had healed, and the entire world followed the beast with admiration.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Men worshiped the dragon that gave power to the beast. They worshiped the beast, saying: "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A mouth speaking great things and blasphemies was given to the beast. And authority to act was given to him to continue forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, to slander his name, and his dwelling place, and those who live in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It was granted to him to wage war with the holy ones, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all tribes, and tongues, and nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the citizens of earth will worship him, all whose names have not been written in the Lamb's book of life who was slain from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If any man can listen, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity. He who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. This requires the patience and the faith of the holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw another wild beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He exercises all the authority of the first beast that came ahead of him. The second beast causes the earth and those who live there to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He performed great signs, so that he made fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles he had power to do in the sight of the beast. He says to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast that had the wound by a sword and yet lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He had power to give breath to the image of the beast and to make that image of the beast speak. He caused many to be killed, those who would not worship the image of the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he forces all persons, the great and the small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>No one could buy or sell without the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This requires wisdom. Let him that has understanding calculate the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
