It was as the sound of a great thunder: and I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders. No man can learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are they who were not defiled with women. They are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed bought from among mankind. They are the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>No falsehood liedeceit was found in their mouth, for they are without fault.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven. He had everlasting good news to preach to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He spoke in a loud voice: "Respect God, and give him glory! The hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Another angel followed, saying: "Babylon the great has fallen. She has fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of his indignation. He will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"The smoke of their torment will ascend forever and ever. They who worship the beast and his image and receive the mark of his name have no rest day or night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"This requires patience and endurance for the holy ones, those who obey the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I heard a voice from heaven say: "Write: Blessed are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time forward: Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works follow them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I saw a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud: "Thrust in your sickle, and reap! The time has come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And yet another angel came out from the altar. He had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle. He said: "Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the anger of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The winepress was trampled outside the city. Blood came out of the winepress as high up as the horse bridles for a distance of one hundred and eighty miles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
