And I heard one of the living creatures speak with a voice like thunder. He said: "Come!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I saw a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him and he conquered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: "Come!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Another horse that was red went out: and power was given to him who sat on it to take peace from the earth. He was given a great sword so that men could kill one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When he opened the third seal I heard the third beast say: "Come!" I saw a black horse; and he who sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say: "A measure quart: U.S. dry. of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see that you do not hurt the oil and the wine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: "Come!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I looked, and there was a pale horse. The name of the one who sat on him was Death. The grave followed him. Power was given to them over a fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with pestilence, and with the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the persons who were slaughtered because of the word of God, and for the witness they gave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They cried with a loud voice, saying: "How long, O Lord, holy and true, before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Each of them was given a white robe. They were told that they should rest for a little while. They were to wait until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers, who would be killed, as they were, should be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he opened the sixth seal I saw a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became like blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The stars of the sky fell to the earth, even as a fig tree drops her unripe figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled together. Every mountain and island was moved from their places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the military commanders, and the mighty men, and every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They said to the mountains and rocks: "Fall on us, and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"For the great day of his wrath has come; and who will be able to stand?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
