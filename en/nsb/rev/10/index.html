He was clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was upon his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He held a little book that lay open in his hand. He placed his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven say to me: "Seal up those things that the seven thunders spoke. Do not write them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The angel I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth raised his hand to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are in it, and the earth, and the things that are in it, and the sea, and the things there, that there would be no more delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he will sound his trumpet, the secret of God is finished, just as he declared to his servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said: "Go take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I went to the angel, and said to him: "Give me the little book." He said to me: "Take it, and eat it up! It will be sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will make your belly bitter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it. It was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said: "You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations, tongues and kings."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
