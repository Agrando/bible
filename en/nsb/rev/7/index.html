They were holding back the four winds of the earth so the wind would not blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I saw another angel ascending from the east. He had the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He said: "Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I heard the number of those who were sealed. There were sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand from all the tribes of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this I saw a great crowd that no man could number. It was from all nations, and tribes, and people, and tongues. It stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes. They had palm branches in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They cried with a loud voice, saying: "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All the angels stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures. They fell before the throne on their faces, and worshiped God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They said: "Amen! Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>One of the elders asked me: "Who are these dressed in white robes? And where are they from?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I said to him: "Sir, you know." He said to me: "These are the ones who came out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Because of this they are before the throne of God. They serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his tent over dwell among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"They will hunger no more, nor thirst any more; neither shall the sunlight beat down on them, nor any heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"The Lamb who is in the middle of the throne will feed them and lead them to living fountains of water. God will wipe away all tears from their eyes."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
