He had great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He cried out with a strong voice: "Babylon the Great has fallen, she has fallen! She has become the habitation of demons, and a haunt for every unclean spirit. She is a prison for every unclean and hateful bird.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"All nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication immorality. The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are very rich through the abundance of her luxury."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I heard another voice from heaven, say: "Come out of her, my people, that you do not partake of her sins, and that you do not receive her plagues!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"For her sins have reached up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Render to her even as she rendered to you. Pay back double to her, double according to her works: in the cup that she has filled, fill double for her!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"To the extent she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to that extent give her much torment and sorrow. She says in her heart: 'I sit a queen, and am no widow, and I shall see no sorrow.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Therefore her plagues literal and figurative will overtake her in one day, death and mourning and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire, for mighty is Jehovah God who judges her. (Jeremiah 50:34; 51:58)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"The kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke of her burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"They will stand at a distance for fear of her torment, and say: 'Woe, woe to the great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her. For no man buys their merchandise any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"The merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones, and of pearls, fine linen, purple and silk, scarlet, and everything in scented wood, all manner of ivory and all manner of most precious wood, of brass and iron and marble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"cinnamon, odors and ointments, frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour, wheat, beasts, and sheep and horses, chariots and slaves and humans</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"The fruits that you desired have departed from you. All things that were dainty and wonderful have departed from you. You will find them no more at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"They will say: 'Woe, woe to the great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"'In one hour these great riches came to nothing.' Every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood far off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying: 'What city is like this great city!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"They threw dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying: 'Woe, woe to the great city. All that had ships in the sea became rich by her wealth. In one hour she was made desolate.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God pronounced judgment for you against her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and hurled it into the sea. He said: "With violence the great city Babylon will be thrown down, and it will not be found any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"The sound of harp players, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, will not be heard anymore in you. No craftsman will be found in you. The sound of a millstone will not be heard in you anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"There will no longer be the light of a candle in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you. Your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by your spiritistic practice all nations were deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"The blood of prophets, and of holy ones, and of all who were slain upon the earth was found in her."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
