There was no more sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying: "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men. He will dwell with them and they will be his people! God will be with them, and be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death. There will be no more sorrow nor crying. There will be no more pain! The former things have passed away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who sat on the throne said: "Behold, I make all things new. Then he told me to write: for these words are faithful and true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me: "It is done! I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him who thirsts from the fountain of the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"He who overcomes will inherit all things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"But the fearful and unbelieving, abominable and murderers, fornicators and those practicing spiritism, idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur: which is the second death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>One of the seven angels came to me. He had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues. He said: "Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy city Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She had the glory of God. Her light was like a very precious stone, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The city had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on each gate, the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates and the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the city lies foursquare. The length is as large as the width. He measured the city with the reed, fourteen hundred miles. The length and the width and the height of it are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He measured the wall, two hundred feet, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The structure of the wall was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each individual gate was one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I saw no temple there: for the Jehovah God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The city did not need the sun or the moon to shine on it. For the glory of God and of the Lamb was its light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The nations will walk by means of its light. The kings of the earth bring their glory into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Its gates will not close in the daytime and there will be no night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They will bring the glory of the nations into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nothing impure will ever enter it. The shameful and deceitful will not enter. Only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life will enter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
