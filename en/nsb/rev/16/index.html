A painful and grievous sore appeared on the men who had the mark of the beast, and upon those who worshiped his image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea. It became like the blood of a dead man, and every living being died in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I heard the angel of the waters say: "You are righteous, Jehovah, who are, and was, the Holy One, because you have judged these things. (Exodus 3:14)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"They have shed the blood of the holy ones and prophets. You give them blood to drink for they deserve it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I heard another say: "Even so, Jehovah God the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments." (Deuteronomy 32:4) (Psalm 145:17) (Exodus 6:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun. Authority was given to him to scorch men with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Men were scorched with great heat. They blasphemed the name of God, who has power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became full of darkness. And they gnawed their tongues because of the pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains, but they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates. Its water was dried up so that the way might be prepared for the kings from the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They are demonic spirits, working signs, which go to the kings of the earth, of the whole world. They gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his outer garment, that he does not walk naked and they see his shame."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He gathered them together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue Har-Magedon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came out of the temple of heaven. It said: "It is done!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There were voices, and thunders, and lightnings. There was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered Babylon the Great. He gave her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his anger wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent 45 to 100 pounds. Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague was exceeding great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
