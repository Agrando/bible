It said: "Come up here and I will show you things from the future."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Immediately I was in the spirit. In front of me was a throne in heaven and someone sat on the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He who sat there had the appearance of jasper and sardius stones. A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Around the throne were twenty-four elders sitting on thrones. They were dressed in white with crowns of gold on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Lightnings and thunders and voices came from the throne. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. These are the seven Spirits of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A sea of crystal like glass was in front of the throne. In the center around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The first living creature was like a lion. The second living creature was like a young bull. The third living creature had a face like a man. And the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Each of the four living creatures has six wings. They are full of eyes around and within. "Never resting day or night, they say: Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When these living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The twenty-four elders fall down before the one seated on the throne. They worship him who lives forever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and because of your will they are and were created."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
