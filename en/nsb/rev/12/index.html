It was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>His tail swept a third of the stars of heaven, and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered. He was ready to devour her child as soon as it was born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>She gave birth to a male-child, who was to rule all nations with a rod scepter of iron. Her child was caught up to God and to his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God. There they feed her a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>War broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The dragon lost and no place in heaven was found for him any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The great dragon was thrown down, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was hurled down to the earth, and his angels with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, "Now has come the salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accused them before our God day and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They conquered overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they did not love their lives when faced with death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore rejoice be glad, you heavens, and you that dwell in them. But woe to the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having fierce anger, because he knows that he has only a short time."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the dragon saw that he was thrown to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male-child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time one thousand two hundred and sixty days, out of the serpent's reach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the earth rescued the woman, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed up the flood that the dragon spewed out of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The dragon was furious with the woman and waged war with the remnant of her seed. These are the ones who obey the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
