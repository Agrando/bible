I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth. The key of the bottomless pit was given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He opened the bottomless pit. Smoke came out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace. The smoke from the pit darkened the sun and the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth. Power was given to them like the scorpions of the earth have power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The locusts were not to kill them, but should torment them for five months: and their torment was the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Men will seek death in those days and will not find it. They will desire to die and death will elude them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. They wore gold crowns on their heads and their faces were like the faces of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their hair was like the hair of women. Their teeth were like the teeth of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They had breastplates like iron. The sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots with many horses running to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Their tails were like scorpions' tails, for there were stings in their tails. They had power to hurt men five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The angel of the bottomless pit was their king. His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The first woe is past. There are two more woes to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice from the golden altar that is before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the four angels were released. They were prepared for this very hour, and day, and month, and year, to kill a third of mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The army of the horsemen numbered two hundred million. I heard their number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I saw the horses and riders in the vision. Their breastplates were bright red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions. Their mouths issued fire, smoke, and brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A third of mankind was killed by these plagues of fire and smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails: for their tails were like serpents that had heads, and with them they inflict harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands. They did not stop worshipping demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Neither did they repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
