It was clear as crystal and flowed out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>This was in the middle of the street of the city. The tree of life was on each side of the river. It produced twelve kinds of fruit and yielded the fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There will be no curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city. His servants will serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will see his face and his name will be in their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There will be no night there. They need no lamp, neither light of the sun, for Jehovah God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he said to me: "These sayings are faithful and true. Jehovah the God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show his servants the things that must shortly be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who obeys the words of the prophecy of this book."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I John saw these things and heard them. When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to me: »Do not do that, for I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and of those who obey the words of this book: worship God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he says to me: "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"He who is unjust, let him be unjust still. And he who is filthy, let him be filthy still. And he who is righteous, let him be righteous still. And he who is holy, let him be holy still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"'Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"'I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"'Blessed are those who obey his commandments. They have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"'Outside are the dogs impure men and those who practice spiritism, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and everyone who tells lies.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"'I Jesus have sent my angel to tell you about these things in the congregations. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Spirit and the bride say: "Come" And let him who hears say: "Come." And let him who is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him drink the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things that are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who testifies to these things says: "I come quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
