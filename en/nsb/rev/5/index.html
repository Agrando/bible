It had writing on the inside and on the back and was sealed with seven seals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice: "Who is worthy to open the book, and to remove the seals?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>No one in heaven, on earth or under the earth was able to open the book and look inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I wept much because no one was found worthy to open, look inside, and read the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One of the elders said to me: "Do not weep; the Lion of the tribe of Judah of the Root of David has succeeded in opening the book and removing the seven seals."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I saw a Lamb that looked as though it had been slain, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders. The lamb had seven horns and seven eyes. These are the seven Spirits of God sent into all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He came to the one who sat on the throne and received the book from his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When he took the book the four living creatures and twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Every one of them had harps, and golden bowls full of incense. These are the prayers of the holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They sing a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals, for you were slaughtered and by your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"You made them kings and priests to our God. They will reign as kings over the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders. The number of them was ten thousand myriads times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They said with a loud voice: "The Lamb that was slaughtered is worthy to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I heard every creature in heaven and on earth. I also heard those under the earth, in the sea, and all that are in them. They said: "Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The four living creatures said: "Amen" and the twenty-four elders fell down and worshipped.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
