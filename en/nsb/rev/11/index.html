They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These witnesses are the two olive trees, and the two lamp stands standing before the God of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies. If any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These two witnesses have power to shut the sky so that it will not rain in the days of their prophecy. They have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When they finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them and conquer them, and kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was impaled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The people and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and will look at them and refuse to bury them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The inhabitants of the earth will celebrate and rejoice over them. They will rejoice and send gifts to one another. This is because these two prophets tormented those who lived on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After three and a half days the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet. Great fear fell upon all who saw them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They heard a great voice from heaven say: "Come up here." So they ascended up to heaven in a cloud as their enemies beheld them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In that same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand men were slain in the earthquake, and the survivors were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The second woe has past. The third woe will come quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The seventh angel blew his trumpet. There were great voices in heaven, saying: "The kingdom of the world has become our GodÂ’s, and his Christ will rule as king forever and ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The twenty-four elders, who sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshiped God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Saying: "We give you thanks, Jehovah God the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power, and begun to rule as king. (Exodus 6:3) (Amos 4:13)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"The nations were angry. Your wrath indignation has come! It is time to judge the dead, to reward your servants the prophets, the holy ones, and those who reverence your name the small and the great. Time to destroy exterminateeradicate those who destroy the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The temple of God was opened in heaven. There was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant. And there were lightnings and voices and thunder and an earthquake and great hail.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
