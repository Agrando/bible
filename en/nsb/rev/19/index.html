Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power belong to our God. (Psalm 150:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"True and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her fornication. And has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Again they said: "Praise Jehovah. Her smoke rose up forever and ever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The twenty-four elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God, who sat on the throne, saying: "Amen! Praise Jehovah!" (Psalm 117:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then a voice came from the throne. It said: "Praise our God, all you his servants, and you who reverence him, both small and great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard as it were the voice of a large number of people, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunder, saying: "Praise Jehovah! For Jehovah our God, the Almighty, reigns. (Psalm 106:48)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Let us be glad, rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife made herself ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"It was granted to her that she dress in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the holy ones."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to me: "Write: Blessed are they who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb." He said to me: "These are the true sayings of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me: »Do not do that. I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers. You have the witness from Jesus: worship God! For the witness from Jesus is the spirit mind-set of prophecy.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he who sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns diadems. He had a name written that no man knew, but himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was clothed with a garment dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with a rod of iron. He treads the winepress of the fierceness and anger of Almighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, "King of Kings" and "Lord of Lords"!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud voice to all the fowls that fly in midheaven: "Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of military commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The beast was captured, and with him the false prophet that performed signs before him, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, and those who worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the one who sat on the horse. All the birds were filled with their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
