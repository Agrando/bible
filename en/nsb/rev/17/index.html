He said: "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So he carried me away in spirit to the wilderness. I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast. The beast was full of names of blasphemy. It had seven heads and ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet. She was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls. She had a golden cup in her hand. It was full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A name was written on her forehead, a mystery, "Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy ones, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her I wondered greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The angel said: "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"The beast that you saw was, and is not. It will ascend out of the pit and go into destruction. They who dwell on the earth will wonder, those whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Here is where the mind that has wisdom comes in. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"There are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the other has not yet come. When he comes he must remain a short while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"The beast that was, and is not, he is the eighth king, and is from the seven, and goes into destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"The ten horns that you saw are ten kings. They have not yet received a kingdom. But they receive power authorityinfluence as kings for one hour with the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"They are united in one purpose single-minded, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"They will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome conquer them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. Those who are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He says to me: "The waters that you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and crowds, and nations, and languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"The ten horns that you saw on the beast will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked. They will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"For God put in their hearts the desire to carry out his purpose, and to agree, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"The woman you saw is that great city that reigns over the kings of the earth."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
