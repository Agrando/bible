He told the people they should believe in Jesus, the one who came after John.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Paul laid his hands on them and Holy Spirit came upon them. They spoke with tongues and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There were twelve men in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He entered the synagogue and spoke boldly reasoning and persuading about the kingdom of God. He did this for three months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some were obstinate and publicly maligned The Way before the crowds. He departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This continued for two years so that all who lived in this part of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God did special miracles by the hands of Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were put on the sick and the evil spirits went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Some Jews went around driving out evil spirits saying: »In the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches I command you to come out!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, and a chief priest, who did this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The evil spirit answered and said to them: »Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The man who had the evil spirit jumped on them, and overpowered them. He gave them such a beating that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This became known to all both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. They were all afraid. The name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Many of the believers confessed openly about the evil things they had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books and burned them in the sight of everyone. When they totaled the value of them it came to about fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The word of God kept on growing and prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After this ended Paul was directed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he passed through Macedonia and Achaia. He said: »After I have been there, I must also see Rome.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He sent two of his helpers Timothy and Erastus to Macedonia. He stayed in Asia for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A great disturbance occurred about The Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A man named Demetrius, a silversmith made silver shrines of Diana. He brought a lot of business to the craftsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They gathered together along with similar related workmen, and said: »Sirs, You know we receive a good income from this business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»You see and hear that Paul, in Ephesus and throughout all Asia, has persuaded and turned away many people. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»There is danger that our trade will lose its good name. The temple of the great goddess Artemis Diana would then become useless. The goddess who is worshiped in all Asia would be robbed of her divine majesty.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they heard this they were filled with anger. They shouted: »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The city was filled with the confusion. They rushed with one accord into the theatre and seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Pauls companions in travel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Paul wanted to enter the theatre with the people but his disciples would not permit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Some of the officials and his friends sent him a message begging him not to enter the theatre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Some cried one thing and others another for the crowd was in confusion. Most of them did not know why they assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The crowd of Jews thrust Alexander forward. Alexander motioned with his hand and wanted to make a defense to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They perceived that he was a Jew and all with one voice shouted for two hours: »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The city recorder quieted the crowd. He said: »You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Seeing that these things are indisputable it is fitting that you keep calm and do nothing rash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»You brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»If Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a grievance against any man, the courts are open, and there are judges. Let them accuse one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»But if you seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»For indeed we are in danger to be charged with rioting sedition because of todays events. We would not be able to account for this ruckus for there is no reason for it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When he finished speaking he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
