He encouraged them. Then he left for Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He went to Greece after traveling through the area giving encouragement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>After three months he set sail for Syria. He decided to return through Macedonia. He left there because the Jews formed a plot against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those who accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They left early and were waiting for us at Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread. Five days later we met them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul spoke to them. Intending to depart the next morning he prolonged his speech until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There were many lights in the upper chamber where we gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A young man named Eutychus sat in the window. He was very sleepy. Pauls talk was long and he fell asleep. He fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Paul went down and fell on him. He embraced him and said: »Do not be troubled for he lives.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He went up and they broke bread and ate. He talked with them a long time until morning. Then he left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The people took the young man home alive for they were greatly comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos.

One day later we went to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Paul decided to sail past Ephesus so he might not spend time in Asia. He was in a hurry to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the congregation to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they arrived he said: »You know from the first day that I set foot in Asia, I was with you all the time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials that came on me by the plots of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I witnessed to both Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»I am compelled by the spirit to go to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Holy Spirit warns me that in every city, prison and hardships are facing me there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I do not consider my life of any account. It is not dear to me so that I may finish the race, and I may accomplish the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to preach the good news of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I know all of you and have preached the kingdom with you. But you will not see me again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»I did not shrink from telling you the entire will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Be on guard for yourselves and the flock that the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.
