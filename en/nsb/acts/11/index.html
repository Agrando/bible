In a trance I saw a vision. A vessel descended like a great sheet. It let down from heaven by four corners and it came to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I looked in it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things and birds of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I heard a voice say to me, Get up Peter slaughter and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I said, No Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The voice answered me again from heaven, Do not call defiled what God has cleansed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»This happened three times. Then everything was pulled up again into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»At that moment there were three men who were sent from Caesarea to me at the house where I was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The Spirit told me to go with them and not to doubt them. These six brothers accompanied me when we entered the mans house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»He showed us how he had seen an angel in his house that stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He will bring you a message so that you and your household shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»When I spoke the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it was in the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Then I remembered what the Lord said, John indeed baptized with water. However you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Since God gave them the same gift as he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could oppose God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard this they objected no more and praised God, saying: »God has granted the people of the nations repentance to life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Those who were scattered abroad because of the persecution of Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word only to the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene. When they came to Antioch they spoke to the Greeks and preached the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The hand Spirit of God was with them. A great number believed, and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>News of these things came to the ears of the congregation in Jerusalem. They sent Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he arrived he saw the grace of God and was glad. He exhorted them all to remain true to the Lord as their only purpose of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man full of Holy Spirit and of faith. Then many people were added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. They met with the congregation for a whole year. They taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>One of them was named Agabus. He indicated through the Spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire earth. He said it would come to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers in Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They sent it to the elders through Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
