There they spoke to a great crowd of Jews and Greeks who became believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The unbelieving Jews stirred up the people of the nations and poisoned their minds against the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The apostles stayed there for a long time. They spoke boldly by the authority of God who proved that their message about his grace was true by giving them the power to perform miracles and wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The people of the city were divided. Some were for the Jews and others for the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then some of the people of the nations and Jews, together with their leaders, decided to mistreat the apostles and stone them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They knew about it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the country around them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They preached the good news there, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A man with crippled feet sat in Lystra. He had never walked for he was lame from birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He heard Paul speaking. Paul looked intently at him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>said with a loud voice: »Stand up on your feet!« And he leaped up and walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Seeing what Paul did, the crowd lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian: »The gods have come down to us, becoming like men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the priest of Jupiter whose temple was there in the city, brought cattle and garlands to the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they ripped their clothes, and ran in among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They said: »Sirs, why do you do these things? We are only men like you. We bring you good news. You should turn from these worthless things to the living God. He is the God who made heaven and earth, the sea and all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»In the past he let all nations to walk in their own ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»He has not left himself without witness. For he did good and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even with these words they found it hard to keep the crowd from sacrificing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jews from Antioch and Iconium took control of the crowd. They persuaded the people to stone Paul. Then they threw him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The disciples gathered around him and he stood up. They went into the city and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After they preached the good news to that city and taught many, they returned again to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They strengthened the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith. They said, »We must enter the kingdom of God through much tribulation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they had ordained elders in every congregation they prayed with fasting. They commended them to God, on whom they believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After they passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After they had preached the word in Perga they went down into Attalia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They sailed to Antioch, where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work they completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The congregation gathered and reported all God had done with them how he had opened the door of faith to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They stayed with the disciples for a long time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
