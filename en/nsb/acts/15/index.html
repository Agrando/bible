They said: »You cannot be saved unless you become circumcised according to the custom of Moses.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Paul and Barnabas had an intense harsh dispute and debate with them. They concluded that Paul, Barnabas, and others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders to settle this question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The congregation sent them on their way. They passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations. They brought great joy to all the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then they went to Jerusalem where the apostles and elders and congregation greeted them. They declared all the things that God had done for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stated: »It is needed to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After much discussion Peter got up and said: »Men and brothers you know that God made a choice among us, that I would preach the good news to the nations that they may hear and believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»God knows their hearts and showed that he accepted them by giving them Holy Spirit just as he did to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»He made no distinction between them and us and purified their hearts by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Why do you test God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, one that our fathers were not able to bear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»We believe we are saved through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, as they also are.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The crowd kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul. They declared the miracles and wonders God performed through them among the people of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they finished talking James said: »Brothers listen to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Simeon declared how God first visited the nations to take out of them a people for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The words of the prophets agree to this for it is written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down. I will rebuild its ruins. I will restore it. (Amos 9:11,12)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»That the rest of mankind might seek after Jehovah, and all the nations, upon whom my name is called, Jehovah said, who is doing these things. (Amos 9:12)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Therefore it is my decision not to trouble those of the nations who have turned to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»We should write to them that they should abstain from things polluted by idols, from fornication, from things strangled and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Moses has been preached in the synagogues from old times until now every Sabbath day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The apostles and elders along with the whole congregation desired to send chosen men to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They wrote letters as follows: »The apostles, elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers who are of the nations in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Since we have heard, that certain ones who went out from us have troubled you with speeches, subverting you, saying: You must be circumcised, and keep the law. We gave no such commandment!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»These men have endangered their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things in person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»You should abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication. If you keep yourselves from these you will do well. Farwell best wishes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the crowd together, they delivered the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When they read it they rejoiced over the encouragement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Judas and Silas, being prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After they stayed there a while in peace, the brothers sent them back to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>It pleased Silas to stay there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Paul and Barnabas stayed at Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of God, with many others also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>After time passed Paul said to Barnabas: »Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the Word of God, and see how they are doing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Barnabas decided to take John, whose surname was Mark, with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Paul did not think it a good idea to take him with them. So he left them at Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Their disagreement was so great between them that they parted company. So Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Paul chose Silas, and departed, being entrusted by the brothers to the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
