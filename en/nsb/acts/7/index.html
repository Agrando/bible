Go to the land that I will show you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»He went out of the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. After his father died, God moved him to this land, where you now dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. Yet he promised that he would give it to him and his seed after him for a possession. This promise was made before he had a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»God spoke to this effect, that his seed would be alien residents in a strange land. They would enslave them, and mistreat them for four hundred years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I will judge the nation to whom they shall be in bondage, said God, and after they will come serve me in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He gave him the covenant of circumcision. Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became father to Jacob and Jacob fathered the twelve family heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The family heads were jealous of Joseph and sold him as a slave into Egypt. However, God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»And God delivered him out of all his afflictions. He gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Pharaoh made him governor over Egypt and his entire house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»A famine and great suffering came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan. Our fathers found no food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>« When Jacob heard there was food in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The second time Joseph got acquainted with his brothers and Pharaoh was told about Josephs family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob and all his family, seventy-five people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Their bodies were brought to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»When the time of Gods promise to Abraham drew near, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Another king arose.

He wanted to unite them and said, You are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The one who was treating his neighbor unjustly pushed him away, saying: Who made you our ruler and judge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Will you kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»When he heard this talk Moses fled and became a stranger in the land of Median, where he became father to two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»At the end of forty years, Jehovahs angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai in a flame of fire in a bush.

He drew near to look at it and the voice of Jehovah came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»He said: I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

The angel spoke to him on Mount Sinai. He received the living oracles to give to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Our fathers would not obey him.

What house will you build me? Said Jehovah God. What is the place of my rest? (Isaiah 66:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»Did my hand make all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»You obstinate men who are uncircumcised in heart and ears. You always resist the Holy Spirit as your fathers did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>»Which of the prophets have your fathers not persecuted? They killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one whom you have betrayed and murdered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>»You have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not obeyed it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart. They gnashed their teeth at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He said, »Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>They threw him out of the city, and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet. His name was Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They stoned Stephen. He called out: »Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>He kneeled down and cried with a loud voice: »Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.« After saying this he fell asleep in death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
