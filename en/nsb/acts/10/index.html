He gave many gifts of mercy to the people and prayed to God always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw a vision. An angel of God came to him and said, »Cornelius.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He looked at him and was afraid. »What is it, Lord?« He replied. The angel said: »God hears your prayers and sees your gifts of mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Send men to Joppa to bring back Simon, whose surname is Peter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»He is staying with a tanner named Simon whose house is by the sea.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the angel who spoke to Cornelius left, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier who was his attendant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He told them what happened and sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The next day they journeyed to the city. As they drew near, Peter went to the housetop to pray. It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He became very hungry. While the meal was being prepared he fell into a trance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He saw heaven opened, something like a great sheet lowered by the four corners was descending to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles and birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Peter heard a voice say: »Kill and eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said: »No Lord for I have never eaten any thing that is defiled or unclean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The voice spoke to him again the second time: »You stop calling defiled that which God has cleansed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This happened a third time and immediately the sheet was taken up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While Peter doubted in himself what this vision ment, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius inquired for Simons house, and stood at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They called out and asked if Simon surnamed Peter lived there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him: « Behold, three men seek you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Stand up and go down to greet them. Do not doubt for I have sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter went down to the men who were sent to him from Cornelius. He said: »I am the one you are looking for. Why did you come?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said: »We come from Cornelius the centurion, a righteous man who respects God. He has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so he could hear what you have to say.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He invited them in to be his guests. The next day Peter went away with them. Brothers accompanied them from Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The day after that they entered Caesarea. Cornelius expected them so he called his relatives and close friends to join him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Cornelius met Peter and fell down at his feet with adoration for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Stand up,« Peter said, as he lifted him up, »I am also a man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He talked with him and went in to find many people gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them: »You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to keep company, or approach someone of another nation. But God revealed to me that I should not call any man defiled or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Therefore I came to you without objection, as soon as I was sent for. I ask therefore for what intent you sent for me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cornelius replied, »Four days ago I was praying at this hour. It was the ninth hour and I prayed in my house. A man dressed in bright clothing stood before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»He said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard and your gifts of mercy are noticed in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Send to Joppa, and call Simon, whose surname is Peter. He lives in the house of the tanner named Simon by the sea. When he comes he will speak with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Immediately I sent for you. You have done well for you have come. We are all present before God, to hear all things that are commanded to you from God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Peter opened his mouth, and said, »I truly perceive that God shows no partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»In every nation he accepts every person who respects him and does what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»You know the Word of God was sent to the children of Israel. He Jehovah God presented peace through the anointed Lord or Master of all, Jesus Christ. (Acts 2:36) (Jesus identified his father, Jehovah God, as Lord of all heaven and earth at Matthew 11:25)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»You know that message which began in Galilee and was published throughout all Judea, after the baptism that John preached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil. God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»We are witnesses of all things that he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a stake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»God raised him up the third day and made him visible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»However, all the people did not see him. Witnesses who were previously chosen by God saw him. We who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead saw him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»He commanded us to preach to the people. We testify that he was ordained by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»All the prophets testify that through his name whoever believes in him will receive forgiveness of sins.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Holy Spirit descended on all who heard the message Peter spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Those circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of Holy Spirit was also poured out on the people of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then Peter responded:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Can any man keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit as we have.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
