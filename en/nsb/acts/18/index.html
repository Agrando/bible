Claudius commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. So he came to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He was of the same trade as Paul. So he stayed with them and worked at their tentmaker trade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia. He witnessed to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they opposed Paul and treated him abusively he shook out his garment and said to them: »Your blood is upon your own heads. I am clean. From now on I will go to the people of the nations.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He left the synagogue and went next door to the house of a man named Titus Justus, one who worshiped God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord and so did his household. Many of the Corinthians who heard and believed were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision: »Do not be afraid, but speak. Do not keep silent!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I am with you and no man will harm you. I have many people in this city.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He lived there a year and six months teaching the word of God to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They said: »This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Paul was about to speak when Gallio said to the Jews: »If you Jews were about to complain about some crime it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»But it involves questions about words and names in your own law so look to it yourselves. I will not be judge of these matters.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He drove them from the court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They all grabbed Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the court. Gallio did not care about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Paul stayed many days. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria. Also with Paul were Priscilla and Aquila. Paul clipped this hair short in Cenchreae because of a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They traveled to Ephesus where he left them. Paul entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they asked him to stay longer he declined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I will return again to you if it is Gods will,« Paul said. Then he set sail from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he landed at Caesarea, he greeted the congregation and traveled to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After spending some time there he departed through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was an Alexandrian who had a comprehensive knowledge of the scriptures and spoke eloquently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man had been instructed in Gods way. Being fervent in spirit he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He spoke boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him home and explained Gods word more accurately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he decided to travel to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him. They wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived he was a great help to those who by grace believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
