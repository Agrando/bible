His wife was also knowledgeable of the transaction. They brought part of the funds to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Peter said: »Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the money from the land sale?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your power? Why did you conceive this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hearing these words Ananias fell down and died. Great fear came over all those who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The young men arose, covered him up, and carried him out, and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to her: »Tell me whether you sold the land for such a price?« And she said: »Yes, we did.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said: »How is it that you have agreed together to put Jehovahs Spirit to the test? Look, those who buried your husband are at the door to carry you out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in, and found her dead. They carried her out to be buried by her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Great fear came upon the entire congregation who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The apostles performed many wonders among the people. They were all with one accord in Solomons porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>None of the rest dared to associate with them, but the people held them in high esteem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and cots in order that the shadow might fall on them when Peter passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Crowds came from the cities near Jerusalem. They brought sick people and people with unclean spirits and everyone of them was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the high priest rose up, and all those of the sect of the Sadducees who were with him were filled with zeal indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They captured the apostles and put them in the common prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>During the night Gods angel opened the prison doors, brought them out and said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Go stand in the temple and speak to the people all the sayings about this life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him. He called the council together and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The officers did not find them in the prison when they came. So they returned and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»We found the prison locked with the guards standing before the doors. When we opened it we did not find a man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted them. They wondered what this would come to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Someone came to them and told them: »The men you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the captain with the officers brought them in without violence. They feared the people lest they should have been stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They brought them before the council and the high priest asked them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Did we command you not to teach in this name? Look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and are willing to bring this mans blood upon us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Peter and the other apostles answered: »We must obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed. You hanged him on a stake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»God exalted him to his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»We are witnesses of these things. The Holy Spirit, which God gave to those who obey him, also witnessed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>One of the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had a reputation among all the people. He commanded to put the apostles outside for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He said to them: »You men of Israel be careful what you intend to do to these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Sometime ago Theudas claimed to be somebody. About four hundred men joined and obeyed him. He was killed and they finally dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»After this man Judas of Galilee rose in the days of the taxing, and drew away many people after him. He also perished and all who obeyed him dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»I tell you: Leave these men alone. If this message and this work are from men it will come to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»But if it is from God, you cannot overthrow it; otherwise you may find yourselves fighting against God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They agreed with him and called the apostles. They beat them and commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They left the council and rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They taught daily in the temple and in every house. They did not cease to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
