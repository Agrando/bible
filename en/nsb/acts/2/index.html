It filled the house where they were sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Tongues of fire that sat on each of them appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. They began to speak with different tongues, as the Spirit moved them to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Devout Jews from every nation under heaven were dwelling at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they heard this sound a crowd came together in confusion, because men heard them speak in their own language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they were all amazed and marveled. They said to each other: »Behold, are not all these that speak Galileans?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»How do we each hear them in our own language?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speak in our language the wonderful works of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were all amazed and were in doubt. They asked each other: »What does this mean?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Others mockingly said: »These men are full of new wine.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter, stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them: »You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem let me explain this to you. Listen to my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»These men are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine oclock in the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»This is what the prophet Joel spoke about:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»It will come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh. Greek: apo, from Your sons and your daughters will prophesy proclaim Gods Word. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out a portion fromsome of my Spirit in those days and they will prophesy: (Joel 2:28)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath: blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable awesome Day of Jehovah arrives. (Joel 2:31)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»It will come to pass, that whoever will call on the name of Jehovah will be saved. (Joel 2:32)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»You men of Israel hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God came among you with miracles and wonders and signs. God did these by him in your midst, as you also know:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»You took this man and delivered him by the determined counsel purpose and foreknowledge of God. With wicked hands you impaled and murdered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»God resurrected him, loosing the pains of death. This is because it was not possible that he should be held fast by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»David spoke concerning him: I had Jehovah always before my face, for he is at my right hand, that I should not be shaken. (Psalm 16:8)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Because you will not leave me in the grave, neither will you allow your Holy One to see corruption. (Psalm 16:10)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»You have made known to me the ways of life, and you will fill me with joy with your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Men and brothers let me freely speak to you about the patriarch David that he is dead and buried. His grave is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»He seeing this before spoke about the resurrection of Christ. That he would not be left in the grave and his flesh did not see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»God resurrected Jesus and we all witnessed this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>« He is exalted to the right hand of God. He has received the promised Holy Spirit from the Father. So he poured out what you now see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»For David has not ascended into heaven and yet he said: Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»until I make your enemies your footstool. (Psalm 110:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Therefore let all the house of Israel know for sure that God has made that same Jesus, whom you impaled, both Lord and Christ.« (Acts 10:36)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when they heard this, they were stabbed to the heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles: »Men and brothers, what shall we do?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Peter said: »Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»The promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as Jehovah our God calls.« (Micah 4:5) (Deuteronomy 6:4)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He gave a thorough witness with many words and exhorted them, saying: »Save yourselves from this indecent generation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Those who gladly received his word were baptized. About three thousand persons were added the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They continued devoting themselves to doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Every person experienced a sense of awe, for the apostles did many wonders and signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>All those who believed stayed together. They held all things in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all men, as every man had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They continued daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house. They ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>As they praised God, they had favor with all the people. God added to the congregation daily those being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
