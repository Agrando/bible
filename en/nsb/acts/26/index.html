Therefore I urge you to hear me patiently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»All the Jews know the way I first lived as a youth among my own nation at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»They knew me from the beginning. They could testify that I was from the strictest sect of our religion and I lived as a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Our twelve tribes served God day and night with the promise and hope of what was to come. It is because of this hope that the Jews accuse me, King Agrippa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Why should it be an incredible thought to you that God should raise the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I was convinced that I should oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»That I did in Jerusalem. I locked up many of the holy ones in prison. I received authority from the chief priests and gave the command to put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I punished them in every synagogue and tried to force them to recant their beliefs. I was exceedingly mad against them. I persecuted them even in strange cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven. It was brighter than the sun and shinned all around me. It also shinned around those who journeyed with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»We all fell to the ground. I heard a voice speaking to me. It said in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads. You only hurt yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I said: Who are you, Lord? And he answered: I am Jesus whom you persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Stand up on your feet. I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things that you have seen, and of those things I will show to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I will rescue you from the people and the nations. I am sending you to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. They may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»You see, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I preached first to Damascus, and to Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the people of the nations, that they should repent and turn to God, and prove their repentance by deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>« Having obtained help from God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those that the prophets and Moses said should come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first to rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the nations.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>While he was defending himself, Festus said with a loud voice: »Paul, you are beside yourself. Much learning has made you mad.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he answered back: »I am not mad, most noble Festus. I speak the words of truth and soberness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»For the king knows about these things. I speak freely to him for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For this was not done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Agrippa said to Paul: »In a short time you would persuade convince me to become a Christian.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Paul replied, »I pray to God, that you and also all that hear me this day were altogether such as I am, except for these bonds.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When he finished speaking, the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and all who sat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As they left they talked between themselves, saying, »This man does nothing worthy of death or of prison.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Agrippa said to Festus, »This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
