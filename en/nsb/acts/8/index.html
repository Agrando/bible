There was at that time a great persecution against the congregation at Jerusalem. All but the apostles were scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Devout men buried Stephen and mourned him greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Saul ravaged the congregation. He entered every house and dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They who were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Philip went to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The people with one accord gave heed to those things Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Unclean spirits, crying with loud voices, came out of many who were possessed by them. Many who were taken with palsies and the lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A certain man called Simon was in the same city. He used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, telling everyone that he was great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They all listened to him, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man has great power from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They followed him because for a long time he astonished them with sorceries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they believed what Philip preached about the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Simon also believed. When he was baptized he continued with Philip, amazed by the miracles and signs he saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Peter and John prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but had not yet received the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When Simon saw the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands, he offered them money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Simon said: »Give me this power that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Peter said to him: »Your money will perish with you, because you think that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»You have no part or share in this matter for your heart is not right in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Repent of this wickedness, and pray to God, that the thought in your heart may be forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»For I perceive that you are full of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon answered: »Pray to God for me, that none of these things that you have spoken will happen to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they had testified and preached the word of Jehovah they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the good news in many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Gods angel said to Philip: »Arise, and go toward the south the way that goes from Jerusalem unto Gaza through the desert.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He went and an Ethiopian eunuch government official, a man of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He was returning and sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Spirit said to Philip: »Go near, and climb on this chariot.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Philip ran to him, heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said: »Do you understand what you are reading?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»How can I«, the eunuch said: »unless someone explains it to me?« He invited Philip to come and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Scripture he read was this: »He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so he did not open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»In his humiliation his judgment was taken away. Who will declare his generation? For his life is taken from the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The eunuch asked Philip: »Please tell me of whom is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip began at the same Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>On their way, they came to a body of water and the eunuch said, »See, here is water. What prevents me from getting baptized?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Philip said: »If you believe with all your heart, you may.« He answered: »I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He commanded the chariot to stop. They both went into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>After they came out of the water Gods Spirit took Philip away. The eunuch did not see him again. He continued his journey rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Philip was seen passing through Azotus. He preached in all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
