He went to the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, that if he found any there who belonged to The Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As he journeyed to Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven shined around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He fell to the earth and heard a voice saying: »Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Who are you Lord?« He asked. The Lord said: »I am Jesus whom you persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Get up and go into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Saul got up from the ground. Even though he opened his eyes, he saw nothing. They led him by the hand into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He went for three days without sight. He did not eat or drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciple Ananias was in Damascus. The Lord spoke to Ananias in a vision: »Ananias.« He replied: »Yes, I am here, Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord said to him, »Arise, and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for he is praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»He has seen a man named Ananias in a vision. He came in and laid his hand on him that he might receive his sight.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ananias answered: »Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your holy ones at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He has authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord said to him: »Be on your way. This man is a chosen vessel to bear my name to the people of the nations, and kings and the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I will show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ananias went his way. He entered the house and put his hands on him and said, »Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you along the road sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he received sight. He got up and was baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He ate and was strengthened. Saul spent several days with the disciples at Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He preached in the synagogues immediately. He preached Christ the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All who heard him were amazed. They asked: »Is he the one who raised havoc with those who called on this name in Jerusalem? Did he come for that purpose to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Saul increased in power and confounded the Jews living in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After many days the Jews took counsel to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Saul learned about their plot against him. They watched the gates day and night to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>During the night the disciples let him down by the wall in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Saul came to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples. They were afraid of him and did not believe he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Barnabas led him to the apostles. He declared to them how he had seen the Lord in The Way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He was with them coming in and going out of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus. He had a dispute with the Greek speaking Jews and they made attempts to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When the brothers detected this they brought him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The congregations throughout all Judea, Galilee and Samaria, were built up. They walked in deep respect for Jehovah and were comforted by the Holy Spirit and continued to grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Peter traveled through all parts. He came to the holy ones at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He found a man named Aeneas who lay in his bed for eight years. He was sick of the palsy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Peter said to him: « Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole! Stand up and take your bed.« And he stood up immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>All who lived at Lydda on the Plain of Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A disciple named Tabitha was at Joppa. Her name, when translated means Dorcas. This woman did many good works and gave gifts of mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>She was sick, and died. They washed her body and laid her in an upper chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him requesting that he come to them quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Peter went to them right a way. When he arrived they brought him into the upper chamber. All the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Peter put them all outside, kneeled down, and prayed. He turned to the body and said: »Tabitha, rise!« She opened her eyes. When she saw Peter, she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then he called the holy ones and widows and presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It became known throughout Joppa and many believed in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He waited many days in Jappa with Simon a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
