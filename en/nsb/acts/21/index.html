The next day we went to Rhodes and then to Patara.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>We went aboard a ship sailing to Phoenicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We passed to the south of Cyprus and sailed to Syria. We landed at Tyre where the ship unloaded its cargo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Having found the disciples, we stayed there seven days. Guided by the Spirit the disciples urged Paul not to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the time came we left there and went on our journey. All the disciples, their wives and children, accompanied us out of the city. We knelt down on the beach and prayed, and said goodbye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We went on board the ship as they returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We traveled from Tyre to Ptolemais where the brothers greeted us and we stayed with them one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The next morning we left for Caesarea where we entered the house of Philip the evangelist and one of the seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As we stayed there several days, a prophet came from Judea, named Agabus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Coming to us he took Pauls belt and bound his own feet and hands. He said: »The Holy Spirit says, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owns this belt, and shall deliver him into the hands of the nations.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When we heard this everyone pleaded with Paul not to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why do you weep and break my heart? Paul answered: »For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He would not be dissuaded. So we ceased, saying: The will of God be done!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We packed our baggage and went to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The disciples from Caesarea brought us to the home of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The brothers in Jerusalem received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The following day Paul went with us to James and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After Paul greeted them he reported in detail what God had done among the nations through his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Those who heard it glorified God. They said to him: »You see brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed. They are all zealous for the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»They have been informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the nations to forsake Moses. You tell them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you are here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Take these men and join in on their purification rites. Let them shave their heads. All will know there is no truth in the things they have heard about you, that you walk orderly and keep the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Concerning those of the nations who have believed, we write: they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men and became purified with them. They went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple stirred up the entire crowd and laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They shouted: »Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and defiled this holy place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They had previously been with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The entire city was aroused, and the people ran together from all directions. They laid hold on Paul and dragged him out of the Temple. Immediately the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They were seeking to kill him when tidings came to the military commander of the band that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>At once he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd. When they saw the military commander and the soldiers they quit beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the military commander came near and laid hold on him. He commanded that he be bound with two chains. He asked who he was and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another. The commander could not find out the facts because of the uproar so he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Paul reached the steps. The violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The mob followed closely and shouted: »Away with him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, »Might I say something to you?« He replied: »Do you know Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Are you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand assassins into the desert?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, »I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city and I request that you allow me to speak to the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The commander gave permission so Paul stood on the stairs, motioned to the people. When there was silence he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
