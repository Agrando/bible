He reasoned with them from the Scriptures for three Sabbath days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He explained and proved that Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. And that Jesus is the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Some of them were convinced believed and joined with Paul and Silas. A large crowd of the devout Greeks and of the prominent women also joined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Jews were moved with jealousy so they gathered bad people who organized a crowd for a riot. They assaulted the house of Jason in order to bring them out to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they did not find them they dragged Jason and other brothers before the rulers of the city. They said: »These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jason welcomed them. They all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The crowd and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They made Jason post bond and they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived there they went to the synagogue of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Bereans were nobler than those in Thessalonica because they received the word with all readiness of mind and examined the Scriptures daily to see if what Paul told them was true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Many of them believed. So did the prominent Greek women and prominent men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Beroea, they went there and stirred up the crowds and caused trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The brothers immediately sent Paul to the sea. Silas and Timothy stayed at Beroea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens. He sent orders to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Paul waited for them at Athens. His spirit was irritated within him when he saw the city full of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and devout persons. He went to the marketplace every day with those who would meet with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. Some said: What is this babbler saying? Others: He seems to be advocating strange gods because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus. They said, »May we know what is this new teaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»You bring strange ideas to our ears. We want to know what these things mean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Athenians and the strangers who lived there spent their time doing nothing else except talking about and listening to new ideas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said: »Men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that you are very religious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>« As I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: »To An Unknown God.« What you worship as unknown, this I will proclaim to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»The God that made the world and all things in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He does not live in temples made with hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Mens hands do not serve him as if he needed anything. He gives life and breath to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»From one person he made every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth. He determined their appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»God did this so man could seek him and might find him. He is not far from each one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»In him we live, and move, and have our existence. Your own poets have said: For we are also his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Being then the offspring of God, we should not think that the divine being is like gold, or silver, or stone, a device made by mans design or skill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»God overlooked the times of ignorance; but now he commands men everywhere to repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»He has established a day time in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man Jesus whom he has ordained. Of that he gives proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.« (John 5:22) (Isaiah 2:4) (Acts 10:42)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Some mocked when they heard about the resurrection of the dead. Yet others said: »We will hear you again concerning this«.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus Paul went out from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Some men joined themselves to him and believed. Included among the believers were Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
