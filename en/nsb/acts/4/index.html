They preached the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Many who heard the word believed. There were about five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The next morning their rulers, elders, scribes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They stood them in their presence and asked: »By what power or by what name do you do this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said: »You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»If we are on trial for a good deed done to a sick man, concerning how this man was made well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Let it be known to you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you impaled and whom God raised from the dead, even by him this man stands before you healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»This is the stone that was rejected by you builders. It became the chief corner stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»There is no salvation in anyone else. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They observed the confidence of Peter and John. Yet they thought they were uneducated not formally educated and ordinary men. They were amazed and recognized them as having been with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They ordered them to leave the council. Then they conferred among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They said: »What shall we do to these men? The fact that a notable miracle has been done by them is evident to all who live in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»We must warn these men not to speak about it in order to stop this from spreading further among the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Peter and John answered: »You judge whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»We cannot stop speaking the things we have seen and heard.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When they further threatened them, they let them go. They found no basis for punishment because of the people for all men glorified God for that which was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The man who received the miracle of healing was about forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Being released, they went to their own and reported all that the chief priests and elders said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they heard they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said: »Jehovah, you are God, who made heaven and earth, the sea and all in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»You spoke by the mouth of your servant David: Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? (Psalm 2:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against Jehovah, and against his Christ. (Psalm 2:2)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the people of the nations and the people of Israel, were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you have anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»They were there to do the things your hand and council foreordained to occur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Now Jehovah behold their threats and grant that your servants keep speaking your word with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»You extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders appear in the name of your holy servant Jesus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When they prayed, the place where they assembled together was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The congregation that believed was of one heart and mind. No one claimed his or her own possessions for everything was common property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The apostles witnessed about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power. Grace Gods loving kindness was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There was no needy person among them for as many as possessed land or houses sold them, and brought the money from the things that were sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They gave it to the apostles. Distribution was made to every man according as he had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, this meaning: The son of consolation, was a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He sold his land and brought the money to the apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
