I received instruction in the Law of our ancestors and was just as zealous for God as are all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I persecuted the people who followed this Way to the point of death. I arrested men and women and threw them into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»The High Priest and the whole Council can prove that I am telling the truth. I received letters from them written to fellow Jews in Damascus, so I went there to arrest these people and bring them back in chains to Jerusalem to be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»While I was traveling I came near Damascus about midday. Suddenly a bright light from the sky flashed around me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me: Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Who are you, Lord?« I asked. »I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute,« he said to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Everyone with me saw the light. They did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»I asked: What shall I do, Lord? He said: Go to Damascus. There you will be told what God wants you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I was blind because of the bright light. So my companions took me by the hand and led me to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»A man named Ananias was in that city. He is a religious man who obeyed our Law and was highly respected by all the Jews living there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»He came and stood by me, and said: Brother Saul, see again! At that very moment I saw again and looked at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»He said: The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will. You are to see his righteous servant, and to hear him speak with his own voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You will be a witness for him to tell everyone what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wait no longer! Get up and be baptized and have your sins washed away by praying to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I went back to Jerusalem. Then I have a vision while I prayed in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I saw the Lord. He said to me: Hurry and leave Jerusalem because the people here will not accept your witness about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I answered, Lord they know very well that I went to the synagogues and arrested and beat those who believe in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»When your witness Stephen was put to death, I was there, approving of his murder and taking care of the coats of his murderers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»The Lord said: Go! I will send you far away to the people of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The people listened to Paul until he said this. Then they shouted at the top of their voices: »Away with him! Kill him! He is not fit to live!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They were screaming, throwing off their clothes, and throwing dust up in the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Roman commander ordered his men to take Paul into the barracks. He told them to whip him in order to find out why the Jews were screaming like this against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they tied him up to be whipped Paul said to the officer standing there, »Is it lawful for you to whip a Roman citizen who has not been tried for a crime?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and asked him: »What are you doing? That man is a Roman citizen!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The commander went to Paul and asked him: »Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?« »Yes,« answered Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The commander said: »I became one by paying a large amount of money.« »I am one by birth,« Paul answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At once the men who were going to question Paul drew back from him. The commander was frightened when he found out that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The commander wanted to find out for sure what the Jews were accusing Paul of. The next day he had Pauls chains taken off and ordered the chief priests and the whole Council to meet. Then he took Paul and made him stand before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
