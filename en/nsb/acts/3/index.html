It was the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A man who had been crippled from birth was carried to the gate of the temple called Beautiful. There he begged for handouts from those who entered the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple he begged from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Peter and John looked at him and said: »Look at us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He looked at them expecting to receive something from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Peter said: »We have no money but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He took him by the right hand, and lifted him up. Immediately his feet and anklebones received strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He leaped up, stood and walked. He entered the temple with them walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All the people saw him walking and praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They knew he was the one who begged at the Beautiful gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement because of what happened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The beggar held on to Peter and John while all the people came to them at the place called Solomons Colonnade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Peter saw this he spoke to the people: »You men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Why do you look at us as though our own power or holiness made this man walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus. You handed him over to Pilate. When he was determined to let him go you denied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and requested a murderer to be released to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»You killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead. We witnessed this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»This man you see and know was made strong by his faith in the name of Jesus. His faith has given him total healing in your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Brothers, I know you acted in ignorance just as your rulers did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The things God fulfilled he announced beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Repent therefore, and turn around, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times seasons of refreshing shall come from the presence of Jehovah. (Deuteronomy 18:18, 19)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»He will send Jesus Christ, who preached to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things. God spoke about this through all his holy prophets since the world began.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Moses said to the fathers, Jehovah will raise up for your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to all the things he speaks to you. (Deuteronomy 18:18)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»It will happen. Every person who will not listen to the prophet will be destroyed from among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Yes, all the prophets from Samuel and his successors also announced these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made with our fathers. He said to Abraham: All the families of the earth will be blessed in your seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»God raised up his servant and sent him to you first. He sent him to bless you and to turn every one of you from your wicked ways.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
