A murmuring arose on the part of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The twelve called the congregation of the disciples to them. They said: »It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God and serve tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Therefore brothers select seven men who have a good reputation. Men who are full of spirit and wisdom that we may appoint to take care of this business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»We will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The idea pleased the whole congregation. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>whom they set before the apostles. After they prayed, they laid their hands on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The word of God increased. The number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. Even a great number of priests became obedient to the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Certain men arose from the synagogue. It was called the synagogue of the Libertines, Cyrenians, and Alexandrians. Some of them were from Cilicia and Asia. They argued with Stephen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They secretly induced me to say: »We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and pursued him. They caught him and brought him to the council.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought false witnesses, which said: »This man will not stop speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»We heard him say: This Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All who sat in the council looked intently at him and saw his face was like the face of an angel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
