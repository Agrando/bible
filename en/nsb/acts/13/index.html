This included: Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As they ministered to God, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said: »Set Barnabas and Saul apart for the work I have called them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>After they fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them and sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Being sent by Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They preached the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews at Salamis. John was also there as an attendant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They traveled the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they found Barjesus. He was a sorcerer, a false prophet and a Jew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man, who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the sorcerer opposed them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Saul, who also is called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And said: »You child of the devil, full of all subtlety and mischief, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Look Jehovahs hand is on you. You will be blind and not see the sun for a season.« Immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness. He went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he saw what was done the deputy believed. He was astonished at the teaching of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Paul and his company put out to sea from Paphos. They went to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them to return to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When they left Perga, they went to Antioch in Pisidia. They went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After the public reading of the law and the prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying: »You men and brothers if you have a message of encouragement for the people speak.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Paul stood up gestured with his hand and said: »Men of Israel, and you who reverence God, listen.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they lived as strangers in the land of Egypt. He brought them out of Egypt with his great strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»He cared for them and endured their bad conduct in the wilderness for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»He destroyed seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people as their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Then he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. This took about four hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Afterward they desired a king. God gave Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, to them for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»When he removed him, he made David their king. He testified about him when he said: I found David the son of Jesse is a man after my own heart. He will do my will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»God brought the Savior Jesus to Israel from this mans descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Before Jesus came John preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»As John accomplished his purpose he asked: Who do you think I am? I am not that one. One comes after me whose shoes I am not worthy to untie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Men and brothers, children of Abraham, and you of the nations who respect God, the message of salvation is sent to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not know Jesus. They fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath when they condemned Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»They found no grounds for the death sentence for him. Yet they asked Pilate to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»When they had fulfilled all that was written about him, they took him down from the stake, and laid him in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»But God raised him from the dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him. They are his witnesses to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»We tell you good news. It is Gods promise to the fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»God has fulfilled this promise to their children by resurrecting Jesus. Just as it is written in the second psalm: You are my Son, today I have become your father. (Psalms 2:7)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»He raised him up from the dead, never to decay. It is stated in these words: I will give you the sure blessings promised David. (Isaiah 55:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»He said in another psalm: You will not allow your Holy One to see decay. (Ps 16:10)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»After David served his own generation by doing the will of God he died and was buried with his fathers. His body decayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»But he Jesus, whom God raised again, saw no decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»You should know, men and brothers that it is through this man Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Through him all who believe are justified from all things. You could not be justified through the Law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Beware that what the prophets said does not happen to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Look among the nations, watch, and be amazed. Though you are told you will not believe the work I do today.« (Habakkuk 1:5)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When the Jews left the synagogue the people asked for this message to be preached to them the next Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the congregation dismissed, many followed Paul and Barnabas. They urged them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nearly the entire city gathered the next Sabbath day to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When the Jews saw the crowds they were filled with envy. They spoke against those things Paul spoke. They contradicted and blasphemed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Paul and Barnabas became very bold, and said: »It was necessary that the Word of God should first be spoken to you. But seeing you reject it you judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life! Therefore we turn to the people of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Jehovah commanded us with these words: I appoint you as a light to the nations. My salvation will come to the ends of the earth.« (Isaiah 49:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when the people of the nations heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were receptive to eternal life believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The word of God Greek: kurios: God was published throughout the entire region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>The Jews incited the devout and honorable women and the leading men of the city. They caused persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their coasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So they shook the dust from their feet against them, and went to Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
