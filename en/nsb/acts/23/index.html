My conscience is perfectly clear about the way in which I have lived before God to this very day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Paul said to him: »God will strike you, white washed wall! Do you sit judging me according to the Law, and against law command me to be struck?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those who stood near him said, »Do you revile the high priest of God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Paul said, »I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest. It is written: You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Paul saw that part of them were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin: »Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of the dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he said this dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The crowd was divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit. The Pharisees believe both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There arose a great cry. The scribes who were on the Pharisees side arose and spoke, »We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The dispute became so violent the commander was afraid they would pull Paul to pieces. He commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force, and to bring him into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The following night the Lord stood by him and said: »Be of good courage, Paul, for just as you testified about me in Jerusalem, so you also must bear witness at Rome.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When day arrived some of the Jews came together and united with an oath saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There were more than forty involved in this conspiracy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They went to the chief priests and elders and said: »We have united with a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Now therefore you, with the Sanhedrin, inform the commander that he bring him down to you tomorrow. You say you would inquire some more regarding him. We are ready to put him to death before he comes near.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hearing about the ambush, Pauls sisters son entered the barracks and reported to Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Paul called one of the centurions and said: »Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The officer took him to the commander, and said: »The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to say to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The commander took him by the hand and led him off by himself, and asked: »What do you have to tell me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said: »The Jewish authorities have agreed to ask you tomorrow to take Paul down to the Council. They want you to pretend the Council wants to get more accurate information about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Do not give in to them. There are more than forty men lying in wait for him. They are united with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready and looking for a promise from you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the commander sent the young man away commanding, »Tell no one that you have told these things to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He called two centurions, saying, »Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea. Also prepare seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Provide some horses for Paul to ride and get him safely through to Governor Felix.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the commander wrote a letter that went like this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Claudius Lysias to His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»The Jews seized this man and were about to kill him. I learned that he is a Roman citizen, so I went with my soldiers and rescued him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»I took him to their council to find out of what they accused him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»I found that he did not do a thing for which he deserved to die or be put in prison. The accusation against him had to do with questions about their own law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»When I was informed that there was a plot against him, I decided to send him to you. I told his accusers to make their charges against him before you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The soldiers carried out their orders. That night they took Paul as far as Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The next day the foot soldiers returned to the fort and left the horsemen to go on with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They took him to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor. Then they turned Paul over to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The governor read the letter and asked Paul what province he was from. When he found out that he was from Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>he said, »I will hear you fully when your accusers arrive.« He commanded him to be kept in the praetorian of Herod.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
