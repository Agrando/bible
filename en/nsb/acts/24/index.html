They brought an orator, Tertullus, who made a statement to the governor against Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Tertullus presented his case:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»We have seen peace under your rule. Excellent accomplishments have come to this nation due to your forethought. We acknowledge this with profound gratitude, most excellent Felix.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»That I not hinder you more, I request that you to hear us briefly in fairness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»We have found this man to be a troublemaker who stirs up sedition resists lawful authority among all the Jews throughout the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»He even tried to desecrate the temple. So we captured him according to our law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»But the Roman commander Lysias came to us with the use of force and snatched him from our hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»He commanded his accusers to come to you. Examine him yourself and you will learn the truth about these charges we bring against him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Jews also joined in accusing him, saying that these things were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The governor motioned for Paul to speak. He said, »I know that you have been a judge for this nation for many years. For this reason I cheerfully make my defense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You can easily verify that it was no more than twelve days ago that I went to worship in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»They did not find me in the Temple, in the synagogues nor in the city disputing with any man. Neither did I cause a riot with the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Neither can they prove the things for which they now accuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»This I confess to you that according to The Way, which they call a sect, I serve the God of our fathers. I believe all the things written in the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I have hope toward God, which they also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I exercise myself always, to have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Now after many years I came to bring offerings and gifts of mercy to my nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple. There was neither crowd nor disturbance!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»They should have been here before you to testify against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Or let the men here say what wrong they found in me while I stood before the Sanhedrin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Except for one utterance I cried out while standing among them. It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am called in question by you this day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them saying, »When Lysias the commander comes here I will decide your case.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He commanded a centurion to keep Paul. Allow him some freedom of custody and that some of his people should come and minister to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A few days later Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him concerning faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He reasoned about righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come. Felix trembled, and answered: »Go your way for now. When I have time I will send for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him. He sent for him frequently and conversed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix. Felix was willing to show the Jews a favor. He left Paul in prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
