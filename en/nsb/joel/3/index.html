At that time I will bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»I will gather all nations! I will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage, Israel. They have scattered my people among the nations and they have divided up my land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»They cast lots for my people, and traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»What are you to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will you pay recompense compensation to me? If you pay recompense to me swiftly and speedily, will I return your recompense upon your own head?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»You have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my precious treasures into your temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»You sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks. You remove them far from their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Behold, I will arouse them out of the place where you sold them and will return your recompense upon your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah. And they will sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Jehovah has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Proclaim this among the nations! Prepare for war! Stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near let them come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears! Let the weak say, I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Hurry and come all you nations round about. Gather yourselves there and cause your mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Let the nations be aroused and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat Jehovahs Judgment! I will sit there to judge all the nations round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Thrust in the sickle for the harvest is ripe! Come and tread for the winepress is full and the vats overflow. Their wickedness is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! The day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars diminish their shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem. The heavens and the earth will shake: but Jehovah will be a refuge to his people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»You will know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy and no strangers will pass through invade her any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»It will happen in that day that the mountains will drop sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk. All the brooks of Judah will flow with water. A fountain will come forth from the house of Jehovah and water the valley of Shittim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Egypt will be desolation, and Edom will be a desolate wilderness. This is because of the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Judah will abide for a very long time, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»I will cleanse forgive their blood guilt that which I have not cleansed. Jehovah dwells in Zion!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
