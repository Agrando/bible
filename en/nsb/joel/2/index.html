Sound an alarm in my holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of Jehovah comes. It is near!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»It is a day of darkness and gloom! It is a day of clouds and thick darkness! The dawn spreads upon the mountains. This great and mighty people have never seen anything like this. Nor will it be like this again even to the years of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»A fire devours before them and behind them a flame burns! The land is like the Garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness. Yes, none have escaped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Their appearance is like the appearance of horses. They run like horsemen into war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Like the noise of chariots they leap on the tops of the mountains. It is like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble. They are a strong people set in battle array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»They run like mighty men. They climb the wall like men of war. They march every one on his way and do not break their ranks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»They do not crowd each other. They march every one in his path. They burst through the weapons and do not break ranks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»They rush to the city. They run on the wall. They climb into the houses. They enter in at the windows like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The earth quakes before them. The heavens tremble! The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars cease to shine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Jehovah speaks before his army. His camp is very great! He is strong that executes his word. The Day of Jehovah is great and very terrible! Who can endure it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Even now,« said Jehovah, »turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Rip apart your heart, and not your garments. Turn to Jehovah your God! He is gracious and merciful. He is slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness. He will turn back from doing harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Who knows whether he will turn back, feel regret and leave a blessing behind him, a meal offering and a drink offering to Jehovah your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast and call a solemn assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Let the priests and the ministers of Jehovah weep between the Temple porch and the altar! Let them say: Spare your people, O Jehovah, and do not give reproach to your heritage. That the nations should rule over them and say among the peoples, where is their God?« </span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah was zealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah answered his people: »Behold, I will send you grain, new wine and oil. You will be satisfied with it. I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I will remove the northern army far from you. I will drive it into a land barren and desolate. Its advance troops into the eastern sea and its rearguard into the western sea. It has done great things so its stench shall arise and its foul smell shall come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Do not fear, O land, be glad and rejoice. Jehovah has done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Do not be afraid you beasts of the field. The pastures of the wilderness have turned green. The tree bears its fruit. The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Be glad you children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God! For he gives you the early rain in just measure, and he causes it to rain, the early rain and the latter rain, in the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»The threshing floors will be full of wheat, and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I will make up to you the years that the locust has eaten, my great army that I sent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied. You will praise the name of Jehovah your God. He has dealt wondrously with you. My people will never again be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You will know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God! There is none else and my people shall never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»In the last days I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams. Your young men will see visions! (Ac 2:17; Isa 44:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»I will also pour out my Spirit upon the male and female servants in those days. (Ac 10:45; Zec 12:10; Eze 36:27)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»I will show wonders in the sky and on the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible awesome Day of Jehovah comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»It will happen that who ever calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved. There will be those on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem that will escape, even among the survivors whom Jehovah calls.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
