Listen all you inhabitants of the land. Did this take place in your days, or in the days of your fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Tell your children about it, and let your children tell their children, and their children to each new generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»That which the gnawing locust left the swarming locust ate. That which the swarming locust left the creeping locust ate. That which the creeping locust left other locusts ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Awake, you drunkards, and weep! Wail you drinkers of wine. The sweet wine is removed from your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»A nation has invaded my land. It is strong and very large. His teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the jaw-teeth of a lioness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»He has laid my vine waste and stripped off the bark of my fig tree. He stripped its branches white and clean and threw it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»The meal offering and the drink offering are removed from the house of Jehovah. The priests and Jehovah's ministers mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»The field is laid waste, the land mourns. The grain is destroyed, the new wine dried up, the oil fails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Be ashamed you farmers. Cry you vinedressers. The wheat, the barley and the harvest of the field have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»The vine and the fig tree fails. The pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field have dried up. Joy has withered away from the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, you priests! Wail, you ministers of the altar. Come, lie all night in sackcloth you ministers of my God! The meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from the House of your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Sanctify a fast! Call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the House of Jehovah your God. Call out to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Alas for the day! For the day of Jehovah is near! Destruction will come from the Almighty!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Is not the food consumed before our eyes? Is joy and gladness removed from the House of our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»The seeds rot under dirt clods. The storehouses are desolate. The barns are torn down because the grain has dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle wander about because they have no pasture. The flocks of sheep suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I cry to you Jehovah! For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame burned all the trees of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Yes, the beasts of the field pant for you. The water brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
