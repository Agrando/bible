He was transfigured in front of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His garments became brilliant white. Nothing on earth could make them this white.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Elijah and Moses appeared before them. They were talking with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Peter said to Jesus: »Teacher it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Peter and the others were afraid and they did not know what to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A cloud hovered over them and a voice came out of the cloud: »This is my Son the beloved listen to him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Suddenly they saw no one near them except Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They came down the mountain. He warned them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of man had risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They kept questioning among themselves what the rising from the dead means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they asked him how is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He said: »Elijah does come first and restores all things. It is written that the Son of man should suffer and be treated with contempt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»But I say to you that Elijah has come. They have done to him what ever they wished just as it is written about him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd with them and scribes questioning them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Suddenly the crowd saw him and ran to him to greet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He asked them: »What are you talking about?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One of the people answered him: »Teacher I brought my son who is unable to talk because of a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The spirit seizes him and slams him down. He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth. I asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus then said: »O faithless generation. How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They brought the boy to him. Suddenly the spirit threw him into convulsions. He fell on the ground rolled around and foamed at the mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus asked his father: »How long has this been going on?« He said: »Since he was a child.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Often it casts him into the fire and into the water to destroy him. If you can do anything have compassion on us and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to him: »All things are possible to him who has faith.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Both father and child immediately shouted: »I have faith make my faith stronger.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Jesus saw the people he ordered the unclean spirit to come out of him. He commanded the spirit that caused the loss of voice and hearing to leave and never return to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The spirit cried out and shook the child violently. It came out and the child became like a dead person. Most of them said: »He is dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When the child went into the house his disciples asked him privately: »Why were we unable to send it out?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He replied: Only prayer will make this sort come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He desired that no man know about it. Therefore they left there through Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He taught his disciples: »The Son of man will be handed over to men who will put him to death. After three days he will come back from the dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They did not understand and they were afraid to ask him about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They traveled to Capernaum. When they were in the house he asked them: »What were you talking about on the way?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said nothing because they had had an argument between themselves about who was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He sat down and the twelve came to him. He said: »If any man has the desire to be first, he would be last of all and servant of all.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He put a little child in the middle of them and taking him in his arms he said to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Whoever receives a little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John spoke up: »Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in your name. We tried to stop him because he does not follow us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said: »Do not stop him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»For whoever is not against us is on our side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christs, most assuredly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It would be better to enter into life maimed then, having two hands to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the Valley of Hinnom. Greek: Gehenna</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>spurious, but included in King James Version, »Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is good for you to enter into life with only one foot, rather than having two feet to be cast into the ever-burning fires of Hinnom. Greek: Gehenna: symbolic of total destruction</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The same wording as verse 44, spurious: Tischendorfs Spurious Passages</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the valley of Hinnom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»For the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.« Questionable passage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»For every one will be salted with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»Salt is good. If it loses its saltiness how can you make it salty again? Have the salt or seasoning of friendship among yourselves, and live in peace with one another.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
