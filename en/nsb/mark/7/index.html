They practice the tradition of the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When they come from the marketplace they wash themselves before they eat. They follow many other rules. They wash their cups, and brass pots, and other vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Pharisees and the scribes asked: »Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders. Instead they eat their bread with defiled hands?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He told them: »Isaiah prophesied about you hypocrites. It is written: This people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They worship me in vain teaching as doctrines the commands of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Speaking to the Pharisees and scribes He said: »You abandon the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»You totally reject the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Moses said: Honor your father and your mother. He also said: He that speaks evil of father or mother must die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»But you say: If a man says to his father or his mother that which would benefit you is a gift to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>he no longer has to do anything for his father or mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»You make the word of God invalid by your tradition.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He called the crowd again and said: »Listen and understand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. That which comes from inside of a man can make him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When he entered the house away from the crowd his disciples asked him to explain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He replied: »Do you not understand? Do you not know that which goes into the man from the outside cannot defile him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»It is because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach and is eliminated? All foods are clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»That which comes out of the man defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»It is from the heart that evil thoughts come such as: fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>coveting, wickedness, deceit, loose conduct, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»All these evil things come from within and defile the man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He did not want anyone to know that he was staying in a house there. However it could not be kept a secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>A woman whose little daughter had an evil spirit heard about Jesus. She went to him and bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The woman was a Greek Syrophoenician by race. She wanted him to drive out the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said to her: »Let the children be fed first. It is not proper to take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>She answered: »Yes Lord, even the dogs under the table eat from the childrens crumbs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he replied: »Thanks to your answer you may leave for the demon has gone out of your daughter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>She went to her house and found the child on the bed with the demon gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He left the borders of Tyre through Sidon, through the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They brought a deaf man with an impediment in his speech to him and asked him to lay his hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus took him aside from the crowd privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him: »Ephphatha, that is, be opened.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>His ears were opened. His tongue was freed and he spoke plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus told them not to tell anyone. The more he told them not to talk the more they talked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were beside themselves with amazement saying: He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
