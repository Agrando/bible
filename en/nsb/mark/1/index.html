They confessed their sins and he baptized them in the Jordan River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>John was clothed in camels hair with a leather belt about his loins. He ate locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He told the people: »The man who comes after me is greater than I am. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his shoes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I baptized immersed you with water, but he will baptize Greek: baptizo: immerse, submerge you with Holy Spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Soon Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee. John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus came out of the water he saw the heavens open and the Spirit descended on him like a dove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then a voice came from heaven: « You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At once the Spirit compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness filled with wild animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Satan tempted Jesus. This lasted forty days. The angels took care of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After John was locked in prison Jesus went to Galilee and preached the Good News of God to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said: »The time has come. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two fishermen Simon and Andrew, Simons brother. They were casting a net into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said: Follow me and I will teach you to catch people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They immediately left the nets and went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus then saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat preparing their nets to go fishing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus and his followers traveled to Capernaum. On the day of worship Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught with authority and not like the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Suddenly in the synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit. He screamed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»What do you want with us Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus rebuked the spirit by saying: »Be quiet, and come out of him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The evil spirit shook the man hard, gave a loud scream, and came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The people were all amazed and questioned. »What is this? What new doctrine is this? He has authority over the unclean spirits, and they obey him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>His fame spread to the entire country of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus and his disciples, including James and John, left the synagogue and went directly to the home of Simon and Andrew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Simons mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. At once they told Jesus about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He took her by the hand and helped her sit up. The fever suddenly left. So she got up and prepared a meal for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That evening at sunset many sick and demon-possessed people were presented to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>A huge crowd of people from all over Capernaum gathered outside to watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases. He cast out many demons. Knowing them he would not permit the demons to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Early in the morning, long before daybreak, Jesus awoke and went into the wilderness to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Later Simon and the others went out to find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They informed him: »Everyone is asking for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He replied: »We must go to other towns. I will preach to them too. I came for this purpose.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He went to Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A man with leprosy knelt in front of Jesus and begged to be healed. »If you want to, you can make me well,« he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Moved with compassion Jesus touched him. »I want to,« he said. »Be healed!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Instantly the leprosy disappeared and man was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus sent him away and warned him. »Go directly to the priest and let him examine you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Do not talk to anyone along the way. Take the offering the Law of Moses requires for those healed of leprosy. That way everyone will have proof of your healing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the man gave a public account of his healing everywhere he went. Soon crowds surrounded Jesus and he could not enter a town publicly. He had to stay in secluded places and people continued to come to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
