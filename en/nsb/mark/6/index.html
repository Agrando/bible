His disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus taught in the synagogue on the Sabbath. Many were astonished when they heard him. They asked: »Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to this man and how did he perform these mighty works by his hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Is this the carpenter, the son of Mary, brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?« He offended them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus said to them: »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own people and in his own house.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He laid his hands upon a few sick and healed them. Otherwise he did no mighty work there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He wondered at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He summoned the twelve and sent them forth in pairs. They were given authority over the unclean spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They were instructed to take nothing for their journey, with the exception of a walking staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They were to take no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse and no extra sandals or coat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said: »When someone invites you to enter into a house, stay there until you leave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»When someone will not listen to you leave that house and shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony to the householder.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They went out to preach that men should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They cast out many demons. They anointed the sick with oil and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>John the Baptist had become well known. King Herod heard that John had risen from the dead. Therefore he was doing these powerful works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But others said: »It is Elijah.« And others said: »It is a prophet, like one of the prophets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Herod said: »It is John whom I beheaded, raised from the dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod captured John and locked him in prison for the sake of Herodias his wife. She was his brother Philips wife before he married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>John said to Herod: »It is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Herodias had a grudge against John and was determined to have him killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Herod feared John. He knew he was a righteous and holy man so he kept him safe. That is why he listened to John but was perplexed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It was Herods birthday. He invited his lords, the military commanders, and the prominent men of Galilee to supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests, she pleased him so much he promised her anything she desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He pledged to her, »Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, up to half of my kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>She asked her mother, »What should I ask?« And the mother said: »The head of John the Baptist.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At once she went to the king and asked: »Will you give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The king was very sorry. Even so he kept his promise to her. He did not turn her down. This also showed his dinner guests he was a man of his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He immediately commanded his guard to behead John the Baptist and bring his head to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the young lady. In turn she gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When his disciples heard this they took his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The apostles gathered together with Jesus. They told him all things they had done and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He told them come into a secluded place and rest a while. For there were many people coming and going and they had no leisure time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They went away in the boat to a secluded place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The people from all the cities knew they were going and they ran together on foot to arrive ahead of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he arrived and saw the great crowd he had compassion on them. They were as sheep without a shepherd. He taught them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Late in the day his disciples approached him. They said: »The day is almost over and we are in a secluded place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Send them away that they may go to the country and villages nearby and buy themselves something to eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He replied: »You give them food to eat.« They asked: »Should we buy two hundred shillings worth of bread to feed them?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said« »Find out how many loaves you have? When they knew they said« »Five loaves and two fishes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He commanded them to sit down by groups upon the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They sat down in groups of hundreds, and fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he looked up to heaven and blessed the food. He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to his disciples. He also divided the two fishes. He gave the food to his disciples to serve to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They all ate and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>They collected twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Five thousand men ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jesus made his disciples hurry into a boat to cross to Bethsaida ahead of him. Then he sent the crowd away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>After he left he went to the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He was on the shore at the beginning of evening and the boat was in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He saw that they were tired of rowing for the wind was against them. It was the fourth watch of the night. He walked on the sea and was about to pass them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a spirit an illusion and screamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>They all saw him and were troubled. Suddenly he spoke to them: »Be of good cheer. It is I do not fear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He entered the boat and the wind ceased. They were truly amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They had not understood the loaves of bread. Their minds were closed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They completed the crossing to the land of Gennesaret and anchored by the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The people saw him as soon as they left the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>They were wherever he was in the whole region. They carried the sick on their beds to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>When he entered a village or city in the marketplaces or the country the sick tried to touch the border of his garment and be healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
