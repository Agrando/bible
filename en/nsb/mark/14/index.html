The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might quietly capture and kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They said: »Not during the feast for it might cause the people to riot.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper. While he was dining a woman with an alabaster vase filled with costly perfume, of pure nard spikenard, brake it open and poured it over his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Some were very indignant over this. They asked, »What was the purpose of this waste of ointment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»This ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii. And the money could have been given to the poor. They scolded her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said: »Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She did a good thing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You always have the poor with you and you can do them good. You do not always have me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»She did what she could! She anointed my body beforehand for burying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Truly I tell you everywhere the good news is preached through out the whole world, that which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might betray Jesus to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money. He looked for ways how he might conveniently deliver Jesus to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now it was the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover. His disciples said to him: »Where do you want to go to prepare to eat the Passover?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He sent two of his disciples into the city. He said: »Meet a man bearing a pitcher of water and follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Where he leads you say to the master of the house: The Teacher says where is my guest-chamber? Where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»He will show you a large upper room. It is furnished and ready. Prepare it for us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The disciples went to the city and found everything as he described and they prepared for the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When it was evening he came with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While they sat and ate Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, even he that eats with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They were sorrowful and said to him one by one: »Is it I?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them: »It is one of the twelve, he that dips with me in the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»The Son of man goes even as it is written of him. Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better if he had not been born.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to them, and said: »Take it, this means represents my body.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He took a cup, and when he had given praise, he gave it to them and they all had a drink from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said: »This means represents my blood of the covenant given for men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Truly I say to you, I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>After a song of praise to God they went to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus told them: »You would all be turned away from me. It is written, I will put the keeper of the sheep to death, and the sheep will be put to flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»After I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Peter declared to him: »Even though all shall leave you I will not.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said to Peter: »I tell you that before the rooster crows twice tonight, you will say three times that you do not know me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Peter answered even more strongly: »I will never say that, even if I have to die with you!« All the other disciples said the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples: »Sit here while I pray.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He took Peter, James and John with him. He was very distressed and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said to them: »I am very sorrowful to the point of death. Stay here with me and watch.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He went forward a little ways and fell on the ground to pray. He prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said: »Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Take this cup from me. Even so not what I will, but what you will.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He returned to find them sleeping. He said to Peter, »Simon why do you sleep? Could you not watch for one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»To avoid temptation watch and pray. The spirit truly is willing but the flesh is weak.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again he went away and prayed, and spoke the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He came and found them asleep again. They did not know what to say to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He came a third time and said to them: »Sleep and take your rest. It is enough the hour has come. Look, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»Rise up and let us go. He that betrays me is near.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Suddenly, as he spoke, Judas one of the twelve arrived. A great crowd with swords and spears were with him. They were from the chief priests, scribes and elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He who betrayed him gave them a sign. He told them the one I kiss is the one to capture and take away safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When he arrived he went straight to him and said: »Master« and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They grabbed him and took him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>One of those who were near took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said: »Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»I was with you every day in the Temple teaching and you did not take me. This is done so that the scriptures will be fulfilled.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>They all left him, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>A young man followed him. He was wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. They tried to grab him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But they got a hold of the linen cloth and he fled naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They led Jesus away to the high priest. The chief priests, elders and scribes came together with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Peter followed him at a distance. He followed into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers staying warm by the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the chief priests and the whole council looked for witness against Jesus to put him to death. They found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Many gave false witness against him. But their witness was not in agreement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>One person falsely witnessed against him by saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>»We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Even so their witness did not agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>The high priest stood in the middle of them, and said to Jesus: »Do you not answer? What is it these say against you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he kept quiet and said nothing. Again the high priest questioned him: »Are you the Christ, the son of the Holy One?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus said: »I am and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Violently parting his robes, the high priest said: »What need do we have for more witnesses?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>We have heard his words against God. What is your opinion? They all said he should be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Some spit on him and covering his face they gave him blows. Guess who hit you, they said. The leaders took him and beat him with their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Peter was still in the courtyard when one of the High Priests servant women came by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said: »You were with Jesus of Nazareth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>He denied it. »I do not know and I do not understand what you are talking about,« he answered. He went out into the passageway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>The servant woman saw him there and told bystanders, »He is one of them!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Peter denied it again. Later the bystanders accused Peter again saying: »You cannot deny that you are one of them, because you, too, are from Galilee.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Then Peter said: »I swear I am telling the truth! May God punish me if I lie! I do not know the man you are talking about!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Then a rooster crowed. Peter remembered what Jesus said: »Before the rooster crows two times, you will deny me three times.« He broke down and cried.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
