They had nothing to eat so he called his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus said: »I am concerned for these people because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»If I send them away to their houses with no food they will be weak and faint. Some of them have a long way to go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>His disciples answered, »How could we get enough bread in this desolate place?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus responded: »How much bread do you have?« They said: »Seven loaves.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He made the people sit on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He gave the broken bread to his disciples and they served the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They had some small fish. After blessing them he had them serve the people in the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>After eating they picked up seven baskets full of food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>About four thousand ate. Then he sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Immediately he entered a boat and he and his disciples traveled to Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisees came to question him. They were testing him and seeking a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He sighed deeply in his spirit and said: »Why does this generation seek a sign? I tell you truly no sign will be given to this generation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He left them and boarded the boat and departed to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They forgot to take bread and they only had one loaf with them in the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He ordered them to be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They reasoned with one another saying: »We have no bread.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Hearing this Jesus said: »Why do you reason about having no bread? Do you not understand? Are your hearts dull of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you up bring back?« They answered: »Twelve.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the seven loaves among the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you bring back? And they told him: »Seven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said: Do you not yet understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They arrived at Bethsaida. A blind man was brought to him with the request to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He held the blind mans hand and led him out of the village. Then he spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him. He asked him: »Do you see?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He answered: »I see men. They look like trees walking.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He laid his hands on his eyes again and his vision was fully restored, he saw everything clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent him to his home saying: »Do not enter into the village.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus and his disciples went into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples: »Who do men say I am?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They told him: »John the Baptist and others say Elijah. Some say you are one of the prophets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Who do you say I am,« Jesus asked. They told him: »You are the Christ.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He commanded them not to tell any man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he taught them that the Son of man must suffer many things. The elders, chief priests, and the scribes will reject him. He will be killed and after three days he will rise from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside and rebuked him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He turned around and looked at his disciples. Then he rebuked Peter saying: »Get behind me Satan for you do not pay attention to the things of God. You tend to the things of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He then spoke to both his disciples and the crowd. He said: »If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his stake and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Whoever would save his life will lose it. Whoever would lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»What should a man give in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
