It was very early.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They asked each other who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The stone was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They entered the tomb. They were amazed at what they saw. A young man dressed in a white robe was sitting on the right side of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to them: »Do not be amazed. Jesus the Nazarene, who has been impaled, is not here. He has risen. Behold, the place where they laid him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Go tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him just as he told you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Verses 9 through 20 not in some older manuscripts After he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene. She was the one who had the seven demons that he cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She told those who had been with him, for they mourned and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they heard that he was alive and she had seen him they did not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this two of them saw him in another form as they walked, on their way into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They went to tell the rest. They didnt believe them, either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward he was revealed to the eleven as they sat at the table. He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, »Go into the entire world, and preach the good news to the whole creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He who believes and is baptized will be saved. He who does not believe will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»These signs will accompany those who believe. They will cast out demons in my name. They will speak with new languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»They will pick up and handle serpents. Deadly drink will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After he had spoken to them the Lord Jesus, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They went out and preached everywhere. The Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that followed. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
