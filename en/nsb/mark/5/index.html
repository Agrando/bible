No man was able to bind him even with a chain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Often he was bound in chains and iron bands but he would break them. No man was strong enough to keep him still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Day and night in the tombs and in the mountains he cried out. He would cut himself with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He saw Jesus from far off and quickly approached and bowed down before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Crying out with a loud voice, he said: »What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the highest God? In Gods name do not torment me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus commanded: »Come out of the man you unclean spirit!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesus said: »What is your name?« He answered: »My name is Legion because there are a great number of us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He earnestly implored him not to send the spirits away out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There was a large herd of pigs feeding on the mountainside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They pleaded with Jesus: »Send us into the pigs!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He let them do it. Then the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea. About two thousand of them died in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Their keepers ran off to the town to tell others what happened. People came to see what had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they came to Jesus they saw the man who had been demon possessed. He was fully clothed and in full use of his senses. So they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Those who saw the event gave a full account of what happened to the man, the evil spirits and the pigs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They asked Jesus to leave their country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Entering the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons asked that he might be allowed to travel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus told him: »Go to your house and to your friends and tell them about the great things God did for you and how he had mercy on you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He went away and told others in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him. They all marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Again Jesus crossed over in the boat to the other side. A great crowd gathered to him while he was by the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, saw Jesus and fell at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He pleaded with him saying: »My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her that she will be healed and live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus went with him. A great crowd followed him and they pressed very close to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There was a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She suffered treatment from many physicians but did not become better. She spent all her money and grew worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Hearing about Jesus she came though the crowd and touched his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>She said: »If I touch his garments I shall be made whole.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Immediately the flow of her blood dried up. She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Suddenly Jesus recognized that power issued from him. He turned to the crowd and asked: »Who touched my garments?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>His disciples said to him: »You see all these people around you and you ask who touched me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He looked around to see the woman who had done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The woman was afraid and trembled. Knowing what happened she fell down before him, and told him the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said: »Daughter your faith has made you whole. Go in peace and be healed of your affliction.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While he yet spoke they came from the ruler of the synagogues house. They said: »Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Jesus did not listen. He said to the ruler of the synagogue believe and do not fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He allowed only Peter, James, and John the brother of James to follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The house of the ruler of the synagogue was filled with commotion. Many were weeping and wailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He entered and said: »Why all the commotion and why do you weep. The child is not dead but sleeps.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They laughed him to scorn. He sent them all out of the house. Then he took the father, mother and his companions and went to the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He took the child by the hand and said to her: »Talitha cumi.« Which means when interpreted, »little girl I say to you arise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Immediately the twelve-year old girl rose up and walked. And they were promptly amazed with a great amazement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He gave them firm orders not to tell any man about this. Then he commanded that she be given something to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
