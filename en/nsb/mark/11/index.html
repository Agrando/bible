He appointed two of his disciples to</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>go into the village that is nearby. »As soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied there. No man has ever sat on that colt. Untie him and bring him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»If any one questions why you do this say: The Lord has need of him. Immediately he will send it here.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They found a colt tied at the door in the open street and they untied it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those who stood there asked why are you untying the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They told them what Jesus said and they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The colt was brought to Jesus. They laid their garments on him and Jesus sat on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Many spread their garments along the way. Others spread branches, which they cut from the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those who led the way and those who followed cried: »Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in Jehovahs name!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Blessed is the coming kingdom, the kingdom of our father David.

But you have made it a den of robbers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. They feared him because the crowd was astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And every evening he left the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They passed by in the morning and saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter remembered and said: »Teacher look, the fig tree that you cursed is withered away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered: »Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Truly I say faithful ones shall say to this mountain, be cast into the sea and it will happen.
