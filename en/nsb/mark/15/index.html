They made their plans. They led Jesus away in chains and handed him over to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Pilate questioned him: »Are you the king of the Jews?« Jesus answered: »You say so.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The chief priests accused him of many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate again asked him: »Do you not answer? See how many things they testify against you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus gave no answer. Pilate wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He used to release one prisoner at the feast. This was done by request.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Barabbas, a rebel and a murderer was available for this purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The crowd cried aloud and asked him to do as he always did for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Pilate answered them, saying: »Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he knew that it was out of envy the chief priests delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The chief priests influenced the crowd, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?« Pilate asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They cried out: »Impale him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pilate said: »Why, what evil has he done?« But they cried out exceedingly, »Impale him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wishing to please the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. Then he handed over Jesus. He was flogged and impaled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The soldiers led him away to the court in the Praetorium building governors palace. They assembled together all of the troops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They clothed him with purple. After weaving a crown of thorns they put it on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Hail King of the Jews!« They shouted at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They struck his head with a reed and spat on him. They bowed their knees in false adoration to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After they mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to impale him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus was passing by on the road. They compelled forced him to go with them, that he might carry his stake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They brought him to the place called Golgotha. This means the place of a skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After impaling him, they divided his garments among themselves, casting lots for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It was the third hour. They impaled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The superscription of his accusation was written on a board above his head, »THE KING OF THE JEWS.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They impaled two robbers with him, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, »He was numbered with transgressors.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, »ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save yourself, and come down from the stake!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Likewise, also the chief priests mocked among themselves with the scribes said, »He saved others. He cannot save himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down from the stake that we may see and believe him.« Those who were impaled with him also mocked him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>It was the sixth hour and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: »Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?« Interpreted it means, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Some of those who stood by said: »He is calling Elijah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They filled a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. Then they said let him be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed his last breath of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The centurion who stood nearby heard him cry out his last breath. Then he said: »Truly this man was the Son of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The women watching from afar included: Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him. Many other women came up with him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Evening arrived. It was the Preparation Day (Exodus 16:22-27), the day before the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joseph of Arimathaea was a prominent council member who also was looking for the Kingdom of God. He boldly approached Pilate and asked for Jesus body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Pilate wondered if he were already dead. So he summoned the centurion and asked him about the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When the centurion confirmed it he granted the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth. Then he laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
