He sat in a boat while the crowd was on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He taught them many things by illustrations and said to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Listen, the sower went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»As he sowed some seed fell by the road and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Other seed fell on the rocky ground and did not have good soil. Immediately it sprang up, because it had no good soil</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>it became scorched when the sun came up. Then it withered because it had no root.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Some seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked it so it could yield no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Others fell on good ground and yielded fruit. It grew up, increased and produced thirty fold, and sixty fold, and a hundred fold.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He continued: »He who has ears to hear let him hear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When he was alone his followers including the twelve asked about the illustrations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He told them: »The secret of the kingdom of God is given to you. Illustrations are spoken to outsiders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»So that seeing they may see and not perceive. And hearing they may hear and not understand. Otherwise they might repent and be forgiven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he asked: »Do you not understand this illustration? How will you understand any of the illustrations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»The sower sows the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»These are they by the wayside where the word is sown. When they have heard; Satan comes and takes away the word that has been sown in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»The same is so of the word sown upon the rocky places. When they have heard the word and receive it with joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while. They stumble when tribulation or persecution arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»There is the word sown among the thorns. These have heard the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things enter in and choke the word. So it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Those who represent that sown upon the good soil hear the word and accept it. They bear fruit, thirty fold, and sixty fold, and a hundred fold.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He asked them: »Is the lamp placed under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on the stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»There is nothing hidden unless it should be made known. Nothing is made secret that should come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said: »Be careful what you listen to. That which is portioned out by you might be portioned to you and more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»He who has, to him it will be given. He who has not, from him will be taken even that which he has.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He added: »The kingdom of God is like this. A man plants seed in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»He sleeps and gets up night and day until the plants grow though he has no idea how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»The earth gives fruit by itself. First comes the leaf, then the head, then full grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»When the grain is ready he immediately sends men to cut it, because the time for cutting has come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He said: »What illustration should we use to picture the kingdom of God? What story will make it clear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»It is like a grain of mustard seed. When it is planted in the earth it is smaller than all the seeds on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»But when it is planted it grows and becomes taller than all the plants. It grows out great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He spoke the word to them with many illustrations as long as they were able to listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He spoke only with illustrations. However he made all things clear to his disciples in private.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When evening arrived Jesus said: Let us go over to the other side.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They took him with them on the boat and left the people. Other boats were with him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A great windstorm came up and the waves came into the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He was in back of the boat sleeping on a cushion. They woke him. They said: »Master is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He awoke from sleep and commanded the wind and sea. He commanded the sea to be at peace and rest. And he commanded the wind to go down and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He said: »Why are you full of fear? Do you have no faith?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Their fear was great. They said to themselves: »Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey his orders?«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
