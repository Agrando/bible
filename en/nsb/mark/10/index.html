Crowds gathered all around him just as they always did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Some Pharisees came to him and tried to trap him. »Does our Law allow a man to divorce his wife?« They asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»What did Moses command you?« Jesus asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said: »Moses allowed us to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»He wrote this commandment because of your hard hearts,« Jesus replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»God made male and female from the beginning of creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»The two shall become one flesh. They are no longer two, but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»That which God has joined together let not man take apart separate.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said: »He who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»If she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>People were bringing little children to him so he could touch them. His disciples turned them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when Jesus saw it he was moved with indignation. He said: »Allow the little children to come to me! Do not turn them away for they belong to the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Truly I tell you, he who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall not enter it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He took them in his arms, put his hands upon them and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As he traveled someone ran to him, kneeled and asked him: »Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit everlasting life?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus asked him: »Why do you call me good? None is good except God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»You know the commandments, do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Teacher,« he said: »I have observed all of these from my youth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus lovingly looked at him and said: »You lack one thing. Go, sell your possessions and give to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He was very sad when he heard this for he had many possessions. Then he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Looking around Jesus said to his disciples: »It is hard for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus repeated it again: »Children, it is hard to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They were greatly astonished! So they asked him: »Who can be saved?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus looked at them: »With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter said to him: »We have left all and followed you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, a man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the sake of the good news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>will receive a hundred times as much now in this time, and in the age to come everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Many that are first will be last and the last first.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus went to Jerusalem. The disciples followed him. They were amazed at what Jesus did. Others followed and were afraid. He met with the twelve to tell them the things that were to happen to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»When we go to Jerusalem the Son of man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the people of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»They will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him. Then they will kill him. After three days he will rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him saying: »Teacher, we want you to do for us what we ask of you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He asked: »What do you want me to do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said to him: »Allow us to sit next to you in your glory. One could sit on your right hand, and one on your left hand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»You do not know what you ask,« Jesus replied. »Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They said: »We are able.« Jesus replied: »The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized you will be baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»But to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give. It is for them for whom it has been prepared.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When the ten heard it they were indignant with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus called them together and said: »You know that those who rule over the nations lord it over them. Their great ones exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»It is not so among you. Whoever would become great among you, shall be your minister servantattendant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Whoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»For the Son of man also came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They arrived at Jericho. He left there with his disciples and a large crowd. A blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the side of the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he cried: »Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Many rebuked him that he should keep quiet. However he cried out even more: »You son of David have mercy on me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus stood still and said: »You call him.« They called the blind man saying to him, »Be of good cheer: rise, he calls you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Setting aside his garment, he sprang up, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus responded to him: »What do you want me to do for you?« The blind man said to him: »Teacher I want to receive my sight!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus told him: »Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
