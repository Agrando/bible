He that follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore replied to him: »You testify about yourself. Your evidence is not true!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered them: »Even if I bear witness about myself, my testimony is true! I know where I came from and I know where I am going. You do not know where I came from or where I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Yes and if I judge my judgment is true. I am not alone for I am with the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»It is written in your law that the witness of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I testify about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said: »Where is your Father?« Jesus answered: »You do not know me, nor do you know my Father! If you knew me you would also know my Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He spoke these words at the treasury as he taught in the temple. No one tried to arrest him because his hour had not yet arrived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said: »I go away. You will seek me and will die in your sin. You cannot come where I go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Jews asked: »Would he kill himself? For he said you could not come where I go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He responded to them: »You are from below. I am from above. You are from this world. I am not from this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I said to you that you would die in your sins. Unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Who are you,« they asked. Jesus replied: »What have I been telling you from the beginning?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. He that sent me is true. I tell the world the things he told me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were not aware that he spoke to them about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said: »When you have lifted up impaled the Son of man you will know that I am that person. I do nothing by myself! I speak what the Father taught me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»He sent me and is with me. He has not left me alone. I always do the things that are pleasing to him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Many believed when he said these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus told the Jews who believed him: »If you dwell in my word you truly are my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»You will know the truth and the truth will make you free!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him: »We are Abrahams seed, and have never been in bondage to any man. How can you say we will be made free?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered: »Truly I tell you every one who commits sin is a slave of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»The slave does not abide in the house forever. The son abides forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»If therefore the Son will make you free, you will be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»I know that you are Abrahams seed. Yet you seek to kill me. That is because my word has no place among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»I speak the things that I have seen and heard when I was with my Father. You also do the things that you heard from your father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered: »Our father is Abraham.« Jesus replied: »If you were Abrahams children, you would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»You seek to kill me. I told you the truth! I heard it from God. Abraham did not do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»You do the works of your father.« They said: »We were not born of fornication. We have one Father, God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said: »If God were your Father you would love me. I came from God! I have not come from myself. He sent me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»Why do you not understand what I say? Can you not hear me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»You are from your father Satan the Devil slandererfalse accuser! You want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning. He does not stand for the truth. There is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks his own lies. He is a liar and the father of the lie!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»I tell you the truth and you do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Which of you convicted me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»He that is of God hears the words of God. That is why you do not listen. You are not from God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews answered: »Do we not speak correctly that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered: »I have no demon. I honor my Father and you dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»I do not seek my own glory. There is one that seeks and judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»Truly I tell you if a man obeys my word he will never see death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews said to him: »Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets died. And you say if a man obeys my word he will never taste of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>»Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died! The prophets also died. Who do you make yourself out to be?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered: »If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. My Father glorifies me. He is the one whom you say is your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>»You do not know him. I know him. If I say I do not know him I would be like you, a liar! But I know him and obey his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>»Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it and was glad.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Jews replied: »You are not yet fifty years old. Have you seen Abraham?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said: »I tell you the truth, I existed before Abraham was born!« (Ex 3:14-15)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They took up stones to throw at him. But Jesus hid himself and left the temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
