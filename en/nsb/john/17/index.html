He said: »Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that the son may glorify you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»You have given him authority over all flesh that he may give everlasting life to the ones whom you have given him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»This is everlasting life that they should have *deep, intimate knowledge of you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have commissioned. *Greek: ginosko: know, perceive, be sure, understand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»I glorified you on the earth. I accomplished the work you gave me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»And now, Father, glorify me with you, the glory that I had with you before the world existed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I taught your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours and you gave them to me. They have lived by your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Now they know that all things you gave me are from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I gave them the words that you gave me. They understood them and knew I came from you. They believed you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I pray for them. I do not pray for the world. I pray only for those you gave me, for they are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine and I am glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I am no more in the world but they are in the world. I come to you Holy Father. Keep them in your name, which you have given to me, that they may be one*, even as we are. *Greek: heis; united in purpose and love</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»While I was with them I kept them in your name, which you have given to me. I guarded them, and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Now I come to you. I spoke these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I gave them your word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I do not pray that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Sanctify them by your truth. Your word is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»As you commissioned sent me into the world, I commissioned sent them into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I sanctify myself for them, that they may be sanctified by truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I pray, not for these alone but for those who will believe in me through their word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»May they all be united in agreement as one. Just as you, Father, are with me, and I am with you. Help them be united with us! That way the world may believe that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»I have given them the glory that you gave me in order that they may be one even as we are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»I with them, and you with me, that they may accomplish complete unity. That way the world may know that you sent me and that you love them just as you love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Father, I desire that these whom you gave me may be with me where I am. I want them to see the glory you have given me. For you loved me before the creation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Righteous Father, the world has not known you. I know you and those you sent me know you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I have made your name known, and will make it known. That way your love for me may be with them and I may be with them.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
