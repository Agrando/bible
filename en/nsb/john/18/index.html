He asked: »Whom do you seek?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They answered him: »Jesus of Nazareth.« Jesus replied: »I am he.« Judas the betrayer was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When he said to them I am he they drew back and fell to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Again he asked: »Whom do you seek?« And they said: »Jesus of Nazareth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered: »I told you that I am he. If you seek me let these go their way.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That way the word he spoke might be fulfilled; I lost none of those you gave me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Simon Peter drew the sword he had, struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus said to Peter: »Put the sword in the sheath. Shall I drink the cup the Father has given me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The soldiers, the military commanders, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They led him to Annas first for he was father in law to Caiaphas who was high priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Caiaphas was the man who gave counsel to the Jews that it was for their benefit that one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple. The high priest knew that disciple. He entered the court of the high priest with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Peter stood outside the door. The disciple known by the high priest went out and spoke to the woman who kept the door and he brought in Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The maid that kept the door asked Peter: »Are you also one of this mans disciples?« He said: »I am not.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It was cold. So the servants and officers warmed themselves by the fire. Peter also stood by the fire to get warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about the things he taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered him: »I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple where all the Jews gathered. I spoke nothing in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Why do you ask me? Ask them that heard me what I spoke to them. They know the things I said.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he said this one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus with his hand, saying: »You answer the high priest!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him: »If I spoke evil, bear witness of the evil. But if I spoke honestly, why do you strike me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Simon Peter stood nearby warming himself. They asked him: »Are you also one of his disciples?« He denied it saying: »I am not.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, said: »Did I see you in the garden with him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter denied it again. Then the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early and they did not enter directly into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pilate went to them and asked: »What accusation do you make against this man?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered: »If this man were not an evildoer we would not deliver him to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pilate replied: »Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.« The Jews said: »It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus the word of Jesus would be fulfilled when he spoke about the kind of death he would experience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Pilate entered again into the Praetorium. He called Jesus and asked him: »Are you the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered: »You say this about me. Or did others tell you it concerning me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered: »Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me! What have you done?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered: »My kingdom is not of this world! If my kingdom were of this world my servants would fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews. My kingdom is not from this domain.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate said: »Are you a king then?« Jesus answered: »As you say I am a king. I was born and came into the world for this purpose, that I should bear witness to the truth! Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate then asked: »What is truth?« After saying this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them: »I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»You have a custom that I release someone to you at the Passover. Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They cried out: »Not this man, but Barabbas. Barabbas was a robber.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
