They dressed him in a purple garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They came to him, and said: »Hail, King of the Jews!« They struck him with their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate went out again, and said to them: »Look, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said: »Look, the man!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out: »Impale him! Impale him!« Pilate replied: »Take him yourselves, and impale him for he has committed no crime!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him: »We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilate heard this he was more afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus: »Where are you from?« But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pilate said: »Will you not speak to me? Do you know I have the power to release you and the power to impale you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered him: »You would have no power against me except it was given you from above. Therefore he that delivered me to you has greater sin.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As a result of this Pilate sought to release him. The Jews cried out: »If you release this man you are not Caesars friend. Every one that makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment-seat. They were at a place called The Stone Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the Preparation of the Passover, about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews: »Behold, your King!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They cried out: »Away with him, away with him, impale him!« Pilate asked: »Should I impale your King?« The chief priests answered: »We have no king but Caesar.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he delivered him to them to be impaled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They took Jesus bearing his own stake to the place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They impaled him there. Two others were impaled and Jesus stake was placed in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pilate wrote a title and put it on the stake. There it was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This title was read by many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was impaled was near the city. It was written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: »Do not write, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered: »What I have written, I have written.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After they impaled Jesus the soldiers took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier. The coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They said to one another, Let us not tear the coat. So they cast lots for it. That fulfilled the scripture that said: »They parted my garments among them, and they cast lots for my covering.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>His mother stood by the stake of Jesus, and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved. He said to his mother, »Woman, look, your son!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to the disciple, »Look, your mother!« That hour forward the disciple took her to his home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He knew that it was over. In order that the scripture might be accomplished, he said: »I thirst.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A vessel full of vinegar was setting there. They put a sponge full of vinegar upon a hyssop branch and brought it to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Jesus received the vinegar, he said, »it is finished.« He bowed his head, and he stopped breathing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It was Preparation and the Jews insisted that bodies not remain on the stake on the Sabbath. The day of that Sabbath was a high day. They asked Pilate that the legs be broken and that they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The soldiers broke the legs of the two who were impaled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already so they did not break his legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The soldier with the spear pierced his side and suddenly blood and water came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He who saw testified and his testimony is true. He knows and he speaks truth that you also may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>These things came to pass in order that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of him shall not be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another scripture said: They should look on him whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joseph of Arimathaea was a disciple of Jesus. He approached Pilate secretly for fear of the Jews. He asked Pilate for permission to take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission. So he took the body away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nicodemus also came with a mixture of myrrh and about a hundred pounds of aloes. Nicodemus is the one who came to Jesus at night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They prepared the body of Jesus for burial. They bound it in linen cloths with spices. This was the custom of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was a garden at the place where he was impaled. It contained a new tomb where no one had been buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They laid Jesus there because the Jews Preparation was close at hand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
