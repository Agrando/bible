Who sinned, this man or his parents?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus answered: »This man did not sin. Neither did his parents sin. The works of God should be made known in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»We must work the works of him that sent me while it is day. When the night comes no man can work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle. Then he anointed the eyes of the blind with the clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He told him: »Go wash in the pool of Siloam.« He went there and washed. And he could see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbors saw him afterwards. They knew he was a blind beggar. So they asked: Is this he who sat and begged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Others said: »It is he.« Yet others said: »No, but he is like him.« He said: »I am he!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How were your eyes opened? They asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered: »The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. I went there and washed, and I received sight.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They inquired asked: »Where is he?« He responded: »I do not know.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought the former blind man to the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus healed the blind man on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Pharisees asked him how he received his sight. He said to them: « He put clay on my eyes, I washed and now I see.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some of the Pharisees said: »This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath.« Others said: »How could a man that is a sinner perform such signs?« There was division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They spoke again to the former blind man. »What do you say about him?« He said: »He is a prophet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and then received his sight. So they called his parents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They asked the parents: »Is this your son? Was he born blind? How does he see now?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered: »This is our son and he was born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»We do not know how he now sees or who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age and he will speak for himself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The parents said these things because they feared the Jews. The Jews had agreed that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the parents said: »Ask him, he is of age.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they called the man that was blind a second time, and said to him: »Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered: »I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I know, I was blind and now I see.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They asked: »What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them: »I told you before and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Would you also become his disciples?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they spoke abusively to him: »You are his disciple! We are disciples of Moses.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spoke to Moses. As for this man we do not know where he is from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered: »This certainly is a marvel that you do not know where he is from and yet he opened my eyes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»We know that God does not listen to sinners. If any man respects God and does his will, God listens to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Since the world began no one ever heard of a man opening the eyes of someone born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered: »You were born in sin and you teach us?« Then they threw him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they threw him out. He found him and said: »Do you believe in the Son of God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered: »Who is he Lord that I may believe in him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus replied: »You both see and hear him for he speaks with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Lord I believe,« he said. And he bowed down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said: »I came into the world for this judgment that those not seeing may see and those seeing may become blind.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him: »Are we also blind?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus replied: »If you were blind you would have no sin. But you say we see so your sin remains.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
