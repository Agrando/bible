She saw the stone was taken away from the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them: »They have taken the Lord away out of the tomb. We do not know where they laid him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Peter and the other disciple went to the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They both ran together. The other disciple out ran Peter and got to the tomb first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He stooped and looked inside where he saw the linen clothes. He did not enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Simon Peter followed him to the tomb and entered to see the linen clothes laying there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The napkin that was on his head was not with the linen clothes. It was rolled up by itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The other disciple entered the tomb. He saw and believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They still did not know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples went away again to their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. She stooped and looked into the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Woman why do you weep,« they asked? She told them: »They have taken my Lord and I do not know where they laid him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She turned and look there was Jesus standing nearby. She did not know it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her: »Woman, why do you weep? Who are you looking for?« She thought he was the gardener. She said: »Sir, if you have carried him somewhere else tell me where you laid him and I will take him away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said: »Mary.« She turned and said to him in Hebrew: »Rabboni,« which is to say, Teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said: »Do not touch me for I am not yet ascended to the Father. Go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and youre Father, and my God and your God.« (Revelation 3:12)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene went to tell the disciples: »I have seen the Lord! He said these things to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It was evening of the first day of the week. The disciples shut the doors where they stayed for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: »May you have Peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were glad, when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus therefore said to them again: »May you have peace. As the Father sent me, even so I send you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After he said this he breathed on them and said: »Receive Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Forgive sins and they are forgiven. Do not forgive sins and they are not forgiven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples therefore said to him: »We have seen the Lord.« He said: »Unless I feel the print of the nails in his hands and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Eight days later the disciples were inside with the doors shut and Thomas was with them. Jesus came in and stood in the midst, and said: »Peace be with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus said to Thomas: »Put your finger here and look at my hands. Put your hand into my side. Stop doubting and believe!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered: »My Lord and my God!« (John 1:18; John 10:36; John 20:17)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him: »Because you saw me, you believe. Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet believe!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus did many miracles signs in the presence of the disciples. They are not written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. By believing you may have life in his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
