(Malachi 3:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He came to tell witnesstestify about the light and help people have faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Not being the light he came to give a witness of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The true light, which gives light to every man, came into the world. (Isaiah 49:6)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The world was made through him. He was in the world and the world did not recognize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He came to his own. They did not receive him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He gave the right to become children of God to all who received him. Even to those who believe in his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They were born from God. It was not from blood, or the will of the flesh, or the will of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Word Jesus became flesh a human being and lived with us. We saw the glory of the only begotten son from the Father. He was full of loving-kindness and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>John spoke about him and declared: He is the one I said would come after me. He is greater than I am because he lived before me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Out of the fullness of his undeserved kindness he gives us one blessing after another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The law came through Moses. Loving-kindness and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No man has ever seen God. The only begotten God-like one who is closest to the Father in the bosom of the Father tells us about him. (Psalm 8:5)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>John gave his witness even as Jewish authorities sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem. They asked him: »Who are you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said: »I am not the Christ.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They asked him: »Are you Elijah?« He said: »I am not.« »Are you the prophet?« He answered: »No.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said to him: »Who are you? We need to know so we can tell the ones who sent us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said: »I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Isaiah the prophet said: Make straight the way of Jehovah.« (Isaiah 40:3)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They were sent from the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said to him: »Why do you baptize if you are not the Christ, not Elijah, and not the prophet?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered: »I baptize in water. There is one in your midst whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»I am not worthy to fasten his shoes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day he saw Jesus coming to him. He boldly declared: »Behold! The Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»This is he whom I said would come after me. He is greater than I am because he came before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»I did not know him. I came baptizing in water so that everyone in Israel will come to know him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>John said: »I saw the spirit descending as a dove out of heaven upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»I did not know he was the one. God sent me to baptize in water and said: You will see one upon whom the spirit descends. The same is he who baptizes in Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next day John was standing with two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He looked at Jesus as he walked, and said: »Behold, the Lamb of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus turned and saw them following. He asked them, »What are you after? They asked him: »Teacher, where are you staying?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He said« »Come and see.« So they came to where he was staying. They stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two, who heard John speak and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He found his brother Simon first. He said to him: »We have found the Messiah Christ.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He took him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said: »You are Simon the son of John: you will be called Cephas meaning: Peter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The next day he was reminded to go into Galilee. There he found Philip. Jesus said to him, »Follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip found Nathanael, and said to him: »We have found the person Moses and the prophets wrote about in the Law and Gods word. It is Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him: »Could any good thing come out of Nazareth?« Philip said: »Come and see.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him. He said: »Look an Israelite indeed. There is no deceit in him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael asked: »How do you know me?« Jesus answered: »I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered: »Rabbi you are the Son of God. You are King of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus responded: »I told you I saw you under the fig tree. Is this why you believe? You will see greater things than these.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus continued: »You will see the heavens opened and you will see the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
