It is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethzatha. It has five porches colonnades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In these lay a great crowd of sick people, of blind and lame waiting for the water to bubble up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Not in older manuscripts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A man who had an infirmity for thirty-eight years was present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus saw him lying there. He knew that he had been sick for a long time. So he asked him: »Do you want to get well?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The sick man replied: »I have no man to put me in the pool when the water is stirred. Others step down before I can go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus said: »Arise pick up your bed and walk.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Immediately the man was made whole. He picked up his bed and walked. It happened on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the Jews told the man who was cured: »It is not lawful for you to pickup your bed for it is the Sabbath.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered: »He who made me whole told me to pick up my bed and walk.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Who is the man,« they asked, »that said to you pick up your bed and walk?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He did not know who healed him for Jesus quietly left the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Later Jesus found him in the temple and told him: »Now that you are healed do not sin anymore and avoid worse things happening to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man went away and told the Jews Jesus made him whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Jews persecuted Jesus because he did these things on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus responded to them: »My Father works until now and I work.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews intensified their efforts to kill him for these reasons: he broke the Sabbath and he also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered them: »Truly I tell you the Son can do nothing by himself. He sees the Father do something and then he does it. Whatever the Father does the Son does in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»The Father loves the Son. He shows him all of the things he does. He will show him greater works than these. And you will marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»The Father raises the dead and gives them life. The Son also gives life to those he wills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The Father does not judge any man for he has given all judgment to the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»All may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Truly, Truly I say to you, he who hears my word, and believes him that sent me, has everlasting life. He will not receive judgment for he has passed out of death into life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Truly I tell you, the hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear listenunderstand will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»The Son has life in himself just as the Father has life in himself. For the Father gave him life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»And he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Do not wonder about this for the hour is coming when everyone in the grave will hear his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»They will return. Those who did good will have the resurrection of life. Those who did evil will receive the resurrection of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»I can do nothing by myself. So I hear and judge and my judgment is righteous. I do not seek my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»If I alone testify about myself, my testimony is not enough truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»There is another who testifies about me. I know that his evidence about me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»You sent people to John the Baptist and he has witnessed about the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»The testimony I receive is not from man. However I say these things that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»He was the lamp that burns and shines. You were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»The testimony I have is greater than that of John. The works I do are the works the Father gave me to accomplish. They testify that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»The Father who sent me testifies about me. You have not heard his voice nor seen him at any time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»You do not have his word dwelling in you. This is because you do not believe in the person he has sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»You search investigatestudy the Scriptures because you think that in them you have everlasting life. These Scriptures testify about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»And yet you will not come to me that you may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»I do not accept glory from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»I know that the love of God is not in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»I came in my Fathers name and you did not receive me. If another came in his own name you would receive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»How can you believe? You seek praise and glory from one another? Why do you not seek the glory that comes from the only God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Moses on whom you have set your hope is a plaintiff against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»It is a fact! If you believed Moses you would believe me. He wrote about me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»If you do not believe his writings how will you believe my words?«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
