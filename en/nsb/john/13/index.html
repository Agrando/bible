He loved his own who were in the world to the very end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The devil influenced the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simons son. So he betrayed him during the meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus knew that the Father had given him power over all things. He also knew it came from God and he returns it to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He got up from the meal and laid aside his garments. He wrapped a towel around his waist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then he poured water into the basin and washed the disciples feet. He wiped them with the towel he was wearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When he approached, Simon Peter said: »Lord do you wash my feet?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»You do not know what I do now,« Jesus said: »but you will understand later.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said: »You will never wash my feet.« Jesus answered him: »If I do not wash you; you have no part with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter replied: »Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus responded: »He that is bathed must wash his feet. He is clean everywhere and you are clean, but not all.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He knew who would betray him. That is why he said you are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After he washed their feet he put his outer garments on and sat down. He asked: »Do you know what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»You call me Teacher and Lord and you are right for I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»If the Teacher and Lord washed your feet you should wash one anothers feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I have given you an example. You should also do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Truly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his master. Neither is one that is sent greater than he that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I do not speak about all of you. I know whom I have chosen! This way the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eats my bread lifted up his heel against me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I tell you before it happens. So that when it takes place you may believe that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Truly I say to you, he who receives whom ever I send receives me. And he who receives me receives him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After Jesus said this he was troubled in spirit and said: One of you will betray me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples looked at each other. They were perplexed and wondered who it would be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The disciple whom Jesus loved was leaning on his chest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter motioned to him: »Ask him who it is,« he urged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He leaned back on Jesus breast and said to him: »Lord, who is it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered: »It is he to whom I give a piece of bread after I dip it.« So when he dipped the bread he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After he was given the piece of bread Satan entered him. Jesus said to him: »Do what you do quickly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>No man at the table knew for what purpose he spoke this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Some thought Judas was going to shop for food for the feast or give something to the poor. Judas was in charge of the moneybox.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He received the morsel of bread and left immediately. It was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When he was gone Jesus said: »Now the Son of man is glorified praisedexultedproclaimedhonored and God is glorified through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»If God is glorified through him, God will also immediately glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Little children I am with you for a little while. You will seek me and as I told the Jews now I say to you, where I go, you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»All men will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said: »Lord where are you going?« Jesus answered: »Where I am going you cannot follow me now. You will follow me later.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said: »Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered: »Will you lay down your life for me? Truly I tell you the cock will not crow till you have denied me three times.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
