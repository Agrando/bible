He cleans every branch that bears fruit. That way it may bear more fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»You are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Remain with me, and I with you. The branch cannot bear fruit by itself. It must remain on the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»I am the vine and you are the branches. He that remains with me, and I with him, the same bears much fruit. You can do nothing apart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»If a man does not remain with me, he is removed as a branch, and withers. They gather them and throw them into the fire where they are burned destroyedconsumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»If you remain with me, and my words remain with you, ask whatever you will, and it will be done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»My Father is glorified when you bear much fruit. You will be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I love you just as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»If you obey my commandments you will remain in my love. I have obeyed my Fathers commandments and remain in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I spoke these things in order that my joy may continue with you and your joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»No man has greater love then this that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»You are my friends if you do the things that I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»I no longer call you servants for the servant does not know what the lord does. I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»You did not choose me. I chose you and appointed you. You should go and bear fruit and your fruit should remain. Whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»These things I command you, that you may love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»If you were of the world, the world would love its own. I chose you out of the world. The world hates you because you are not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Remember the word I said to you. A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they obeyed my word, they will obey yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»They will do all these things to you for my names sake. It is because they do not know the one that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin. Now they have no excuse for their sin!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»He who hates me hates my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would have no sin. They have seen and hated both my Father and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»This took place that the word written in the Law may be fulfilled: They hated me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I will send the helper from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father to bear witness of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You also bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
