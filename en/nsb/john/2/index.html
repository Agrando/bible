The mother of Jesus was there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They ran out of wine. So the mother of Jesus said to him: »They have no wine.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus said to her: »Woman what have I to do with you? My hour has not arrived.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother told the servants to do whatever he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Six stone water jars were placed there to honor purification rules of the Jews. Each contained more than twenty gallons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to them: »Fill the jars with water.« They filled them to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Draw some out,« he said, »and take it to the master of the feast.« So they drew some out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The master of the feast did not know about the water turned into wine. He tasted it and called the bridegroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said to him: »Every man sets out the good wine first. When the men have drunk freely the lower quality wine is served. You have kept the good wine until now.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This was the first miracle Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. It gave evidence of his glory and his disciples believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He, his mother, brothers and disciples traveled to Capernaum. They stayed there many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He found the merchants who sold oxen, sheep and doves. The moneychangers were sitting nearby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He made a whip of cords, and chased them all out of the temple, including the sheep and the oxen. He poured out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He told those who sold doves: »Take these things away. Do not make my Fathers house a house of merchandise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His disciples remembered what was written. Zeal for your house shall eat me up. (Psalm 69:9)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews asked him: »What sign would you show us seeing that you do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus replied: »Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jews responded: »It took forty-six years to build this temple and you will raise it up in three days?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many saw the signs he did and expressed active faith in his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus did not trust his security to them for he understood all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He did not need evidence about men for he knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
