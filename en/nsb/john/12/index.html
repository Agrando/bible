This was where Lazarus lived. He was the man Jesus raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus ate supper there. He and Lazarus sat at the meal while Martha served.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Mary took a pound of very precious ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus. She wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would betray him said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred danarii, and given to the poor?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He did not say this because he cared for the poor. He was a thief. He had the moneybox and took away what was put in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus therefore replied: »Let her alone that she may preserve it for the day of my burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The common people of the Jews learned that he was there. So they came to see Jesus and Lazarus, whom he raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is because by reason of Lazarus many of the Jews believed in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The next day a great crowd came to the feast. They heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They took palm branches and met him. They cried out, »Hosanna: Blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah, even the King of Israel!« (Psalm 118:26)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it just as it is written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Do not fear daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes sitting on a donkeys colt.« (Zechariah 9:9)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His disciples did not understand these things at first. However when Jesus was glorified they remembered the things that were written about him. They also remembered the things that had been done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, gave witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For this reason also the crowd met him, for they heard that he had performed this miracle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Pharisees spoke among themselves: »You see that you are not accomplishing anything. Look the world has gone after him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They approached Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and told him: »We wish to see Jesus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip and Andrew told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered: »The time has come for the Son of man to be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Truly I tell you unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies it bears much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»He that loves his life in this world loses it; and he that detests does not love his life in this world shall save it for everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»If you want to serve me follow me! My servant will be where I am and the Father will honor my servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»I am troubled! What should I say? Father, save me out of this hour? It is for this purpose that I came to this hour! (Hebrews 5:7)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Father, glorify your name.« A voice came from heaven: »I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The crowd near him only heard thunder. Some said an angel spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said: »This voice came for your sake and not for mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Now judgment is on this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»When I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all men to myself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said this indicating the type of death he would experience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The crowd answered him: »We have heard from the law that the Christ lives forever. Why do you say the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them: »The light will be with you for a little while. Walk while you have the light, that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»While you have the light, exert active faith in the light, that you may become sons of light.« Jesus said this and then he departed and hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Even though he performed many miracles in front of them they did not believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled: »Jehovah who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?« (Isaiah 53:1)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Isaiah revealed the reason they could not believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»He has blinded their eyes. He hardened their heart. Otherwise they would see with their eyes and perceive with their heart. Then they would turn and I would heal them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said these things because he saw and spoke about his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Many of the rulers believed in him, although they did not confess their faith because of the Pharisees, for they would be expelled from the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>They loved the glory from men more than the glory from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jesus cried out: »He, who believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»He that sees me sees perceivesdiscernsexperiences the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»I have come as a light to the world. Everyone who believes in me will not remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»If any man hears my sayings and does not obey them I will not judge him. I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»He that rejects me and does not accept my message has one that judges him. The word divine expressionGods Word that I spoke shall judge him now and in the last day. (Deuteronomy 18:19)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»I spoke not from myself but from the Father who sent me. He has given me a commandment concerning what I should say when I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»I know that his commandment means everlasting life. Therefore I say the things the Father tells me to say.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
