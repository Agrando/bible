His disciples baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He needed to travel through Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He arrived at a city of Samaria called Sychar. It is near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jacobs well was there. It was about the sixth hour when Jesus arrived. Being weary from the journey he sat down by the well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her: »Please give me a drink.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>His disciples went away to the city to buy meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The woman of Samaria asked: »How is it that you being a Jew ask for a drink from me? I am a woman of Samaria.« The Jews did not associate with Samaritans.Not in early manuscripts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered: »If you know the gift of God and who asked you for a drink, you would have asked him to give you living water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman said to him: »Sir, you do not have anything with which to draw water and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well. He and his children and cattle drank from it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered: »Whoever drinks from this water will thirst again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»But whoever drinks from the water that I give him will never thirst. The water that I will give him will be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said to him: »Sir, give me this water! That way I will not thirst and not come here to draw.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her: »Go call your husband and come here.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered: »I have no husband.« Jesus replied to her: »You said well, »I have no husband.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»For you have had five husbands. The one you have now is not your husband, this is true.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to him: »Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Our fathers worshipped in this mountain. But you say Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus replied: »Woman believe me. The hour comes when you will worship the Father neither in the mountain nor in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know. Salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»But the hour comes and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father with spirit and truth. The Father seeks such people to worship him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»God is a Spirit. They who worship him must worship him with spirit and truth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman responded: »I know that Christ the Messiah is coming. When he comes he will tell us all things.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said: »I that speak to you am he.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>His disciples came and wondered why he talked with the woman. Yet no one asked: »What are you looking for? Why did you talk to her?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman left her water pot and went to the city. She spoke to the men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Come see a man who told me everything I have ever done. Could this be the Christ?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They left the city to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the meantime his disciples urged him to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He said: »I have food to eat that you do not know about.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So the disciples said to each other: »Has any man brought him something to eat?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said: »My food is to do the will of him that sent me. To finish his work!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Do you say there are four months until the harvest comes? I say to you lift up your eyes and look on the fields. They are already white for harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal. Both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»That saying is true. One sows and another reaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Other men labored and you entered into their labors.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Many Samaritans of that city put faith believed in him because of what the woman said: »He told me everything I have ever done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the Samaritans came to him they urged him to stay with them. So he stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Many more believed because of the words he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They told the woman: »We believe because of what you said and we heard him ourselves. We know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After two days he departed from there and went to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jesus testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The Galileans welcomed him. They saw all the things he did at the feast in Jerusalem for they were at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee where he turned the water into wine. There was a nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He heard that Jesus came from Judea into Galilee. He went to him and urged him to come see his son. His son was near death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»Until you see signs and wonders you will not believe,« Jesus said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The nobleman said: »Sir, come or my child would die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus replied: »Go your way. Your son lives!« The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>His servants met him as he returned and said: »Your son is alive!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He asked them about the hour he was healed. They said: »Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The father knew that it was the same hour in which Jesus said: »Your son lives.« He and his entire household believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is the second miracle that Jesus did when he came out of Judea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
